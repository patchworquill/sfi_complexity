- Already thinking I should script this. Slugs are dead simple. Must be a way to grab all the text and dump it to this format.
  - Probably wanna go with BS4 for the scraping?
    - Here's a nice guide... 

- class="sc-episode-details-title"
- class="sc-episode-details-time"
- class="sc-episode-details-body"
  - <div>
    - <div>
      - <p>All the Podcast Transcripts</p>
    - </div>
  - </div>

- finally got the scraper working and downloaded the 'corpora' I'll be working with
