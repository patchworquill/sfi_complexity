0,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: So David, this is the episode where we lay out what people can expect for this show. What does it mean to be a complexity explorer? And how is SFI intending to facilitate this for people?David: Yeah, I think we want to expose people to a different kind of science, one that they might not be familiar with, a different kind of personality from the usual rather dull representation of scientists. Someone willing to take some risks, present ideas that people haven't heard before, and be honest about the hubristic enterprise that we're engaged in – which is trying to find big unifying theories for the complexity that we live in.Michael: So let's start there, actually. I think when most people think about the project of science, they're imagining that we're sort of tilting the whole human knowledge enterprise towards this single, all-embracing theory of everything. And I know from our discussions that that’s not only not the only kind of science that happens, but that’s not necessarily the kind of science that we're focusing on here. How do you understand that sort of enterprise in light of what we've learned over the last 35 years studying complex systems, and how that project differs from the kind of popular perception of scientific process?David: Yeah. There was a time in the '80s and early '90s when it was very popular to talk about GUTs, Grand Unified Theories, theories of everything. And these were prominent in physics. I like to say that these theories of everything were theories of everything except those things that theorize, right? Because they had nothing to say about life on the planet.So even the Grand Unified Theories, the most ambitious, the boldest, were really very limited in their scope if you actually looked carefully. They were trying to explain the structure of the atom, the way in which gravity emerges, which remains an open question. So even Grand Unified Theories are not as grand as you might imagine. In a sense, what we do here is more ambitious. We declare that in the vast space of adaptive phenomena that span biology, culture, civilization, and technology, there are rules and regularities that can be expressed in a common mathematical, computational language. And so things that are currently taught and investigated in very different buildings and different departments by very different people, actually have much more in common than you might think.And so for example, someone studying metabolism, say, in a biology department, might have something to say about the economy. And someone studying computer networks has, clearly, something to say about the brain. So we're interested in those, and we're interested in theories that can, in some sense, span fields that look as if on the surface when you superficially investigate them, have very little in common. Now, will that coalesce into one giant amorphous theory of everything? I hope not, but I don't know.Michael: So one example here would be if we scale up this even past the sort of framing of this as different quantitative approaches, there's a question about the incommensurability of different fields of knowledge with respect to, say, the sciences and the arts. And I'm curious just how divergent you think an aesthetic or an empirical inquiry really are from one another, and how you see those differences.David: Yeah. So one way to express complexity: it's that domain of reality that balances the random and the regular. And both of those are difficult concepts to understand in themselves, but it helps to answer your question. Science has almost nothing to say about systems with lots of randomness or lots of what we would call contingencies, or in the formal language, lots of free parameters. It really likes compact, small, elegant encodings which do very well at the regular end of the spectrum. Now you can actually think about the arts as being that domain of experience which are incompressible. There are so many specific elements in them, so much idiosyncrasy, so much individual expression, that they don't lend themselves to compression. And that's precisely why they will never be expressed in the mathematical language of physics.So complexity actually provides a partial answer to why these domains of inquiry appear to be incommensurable, but they're not. It's just that they live on this spectrum of the random to the regular, that lend themselves to different languages of expression. I think the novel is an almost perfect platform for theorizing about reality when the reality you're describing has a ton of idiosyncrasy in it, as opposed to calculus or the theory of dynamical systems, which is really good at expressing and encoding a reality that has very little randomness in it, almost none, to be honest, and lives in what we would call low-dimensional space.So that's one way of getting at it: complexity actually helps us understand why these different forms of expression exist. The other one that I find really intriguing is, we're engaged in different ontological and epistemological exercises. Artists are basically in the business of world creation, and scientists are in the business of world explanation…as are humanists, actually. But the difference is, scientists are in the business of explaining empirical reality as experienced, and humanists explaining artistic reality as created. And the rules of the game in creating worlds and explaining worlds are different. One is very individual and idiosyncratic, and one is very collective.So again, I think the agenda is a little different, but you can see how they relate, because actually, there's an element of science which can be about world creation. You can think about counterfactuals: “What if there was no gravity?” Right? “What if there were nine sexes instead of two among hominids?” These are all counterfactual ontological world creations in science. And artists similarly can say, "You know, I'm going to paint this painting, but I only have so many pigments, and I still have to work within the visible spectrum of color." So they have to deal with empirical reality to the same extent that we create realities.Michael: That's also a kind of a compression: the limitations of our tools, and the limitations of the affordances of our technical environments, which sort of segues into the question of the role of the engineer on that spectrum. Like, where would you place that sort of role in this ecology of social functions and modalities?David: Yeah, the engineer is interesting. The great engineers combine the both, right? They create worlds which they then theorize about. And of course, these are simplifications. Great scientists are artists, because they spend most of their time creating worlds that don't exist, to demolish them. Great artists are very, very familiar with the constraints of their tools in empirical reality, because it allows them to be better world creators.And so it's interesting, in the end, at the limits, there are distinctions that are worth making. But the metatheory that allows you to understand them as living on this kind of ontological continuum is useful, because it breaks down barriers, because we're constantly in contact. I mean, my artistic friends are very interested in their tools and instruments and the theory of optics or the theory of acoustics. And scientists are often fascinated by, "How do I more effectively explore a counterfactual reality? How should I liberate myself from the rigors of my discipline to make a discovery?" And I think this is why, here at SFI, we put them together, because we believe that the best ideas, I don't care if it's scientific or artistic, come from a collision/fusion of those different sensibilities.Michael: So I think a lot about this in terms of the way that the act of seduction is posed as an inherently risky enterprise. You're releasing or relaxing your own personal boundaries to invite in the other; and similarly, both art and science, as well as other human knowledge enterprises, are often communicated/self-described in terms of exploration and risk: stepping out beyond the known. So how do you understand science and the Santa Fe Institute's work as a risky endeavor? And how does the kind of risk that's assumed here differ from the kind of risk that is being taken on by other institutions?David: Yeah. I mean, we've talked about this, and I think we're not sophisticated enough about risk. So people think of it as a number, say, "How risky are you?" "I'm like a 0.7 or something." But it's not a number, it's actually maybe a list, and people differ in their risks. Some people will not take risk for their money, other people won't take risk for their reputation, other people won't take risks with their lives. And I think SFI, in that vector space theory of risk that has all these different components, is very willing to take risks with its reputation and stepping out of the comfort zone of a discipline. We're very good at that.It doesn't matter to us whether or not there is a community that says you are of us. We kind of like the solitude of discovery in that respect. And because we are not a big data, big infrastructure institute, we're very rarely taking risks that are financial, because a significant financial investment for the Santa Fe Institute is a pencil, and you're not really taking risks with lead when you write down the wrong theory. So our risks are different from a large lab, for example, which is in some sense taking a risk by performing a massive experiment that might prove to be wrong. I mean, huge investment in grad students and postdocs, in machinery and in physical plants.They are taking that kind of risk. They're not really taking a risk of ideas, because usually, those experiments are very incremental. We talked about LIGO, this incredible, ingenious engineering endeavor to detect gravitational waves to test a theory that we already knew was true. So that experiment in general relativity wasn't a risk in the world of ideas in any way. It was a risk in that the instruments might not work. That you spent so much money, and you didn't detect a gravitational wave. If you hadn't, would they have declared general relativity wrong? No. So in that sense, exactly wasn't a risk with an idea, because the idea would have held. They simply would have said, "You know, our detectors were too sensitive to small seismic perturbations in the environment." So SFI is the opposite of that. We don't invest tons of money in big machines to test accepted theories. We invest the small amounts of money that we have in creative minds to create theories that are not known and that do not exist, and that might offend existing bodies of knowledge.Michael: Listening to this, there's almost a kind of population biogeography consideration here, and that the way that ideas develop and the way that intellectual risks are taken is dependent on the scale of the population that's actually engaged in that. There's the notion that genetic drift sort of buries novel mutations on the mainland. So where do you place SFI on a continuum? Like, if you were to think of sort of the lone, weirdo explorer out on the mountain versus these massive institutional enterprises, how do you lay out the geography of where to look for these different types of action and exploration?David: Yeah, and again, I'm a little obsessed with this metaphor of mountains, monasteries, and the metropolis. There are things that you will discover, let's say, about yourself and the world, when you're hanging from a ledge at 2000 feet that you probably won't walking across the street in New York City. But there are things you'll learn walking across a street in New York City that you won't learn on a mountain. And there are things you'll learn on a monastery in the high mountains, through community, that you couldn't learn in the other two cases. So essentially, my view is every creative mind needs to pass through all three environments.There is a period where you need solitude to maximize the entropy rate, maximize the exploratory side of creative thought. There is a time we need to then subject those ideas, most of which are probably insane, to the rigors of your community who are on your side. And having tested them, bring them to the world in the metropolis. SFI is a monastery in the mountains, and in some sense, it's my job to allow individuals the freedom to climb and to engage in the sort of ceremonies of the monastery that hone their ideas to a point that they can be presented to the world in the metropolis.Michael: Seems like the mountain, monastery, metropolis also maps on to first person, second person, and third person methodologies. That you have, like Depraz, Varela and Vermersch, in On Becoming Aware, talked about knowledge starting in a sort of intuitive perception, first person phenomenological or epistemological thing, looping back to what we're just talking about a moment ago. Moving out of that personal domain into a domain of intersubjective and hermeneutical discourse, and then beyond. I guess, do you regard science as in some way, honestly, a reduction of ontology to these other forms? Or how do you relate that?David: Yeah, it's interesting. I think as scientists we’re not very good at thinking about the environments and the process that would be most effective. Most of us grow up in small groups or in labs, and we learn our trade, and then we simply repeat what we've experienced. And I think SFI represents, in some sense, a very self conscious experiment in the needs of the scientific pipeline. I think we've discovered over 30 years what creative individuals want. And so I think you're absolutely right. I think there simply is a time where the scientific process looks like art. It's that first person assertion of the ego, right? It's, "This is what I need. This is what I think to be true."And then it comes into conflict or contact with ego, which is what you know. And in a way, you're the first line of defense against your own worst ideas. But then those ideas that survive, confront the super ego, the social structure, our communities, more largely what you're calling the third person. So I think you're absolutely right. I think there is this very interesting recapitulation of the individual arc of discovery and the institutions that we inhabit, and we haven't been, I think, as thoughtful as we might be about how those should align. The appeal of SFI is that we're adding, if you like, to the ecology of institutions, some of those earlier phases that I think are often missing in the large scale production of science.Michael: There's another piece in this if we look at this, pardon the sort of biblical analogy, but it seems as though often there's an evolution of religious institution that starts with some sort of desert patriarch or some sort of lone mystical experience that is then tested in the same way, congealed. And at some point it moves from a kind of a mystical experience to an attempt to navigate in a meaningful way, or in a sort of extension as logical conclusion, actually like control the world. That we move from St. John the Baptist to conversations about Catholic dominion. And philosopher William Irwin Thompson described this as actually appearing in two different forms of science, the Pythagorean approach that is open to the transcendent, and an Archimedean approach that's focused on system control. So do you see one of these approaches as more intellectually honest than the other? Or do you think that in general, the scientific community has changed and it's sort of balanced between these points over time?David: Again, it's sort of interesting. These seem like these loose concepts, but I think we don't reflect on them enough. I think these archetypes are real. Certainly SFI, by your definition, is much more on the side of Pythagoras than Archimedes, but without Archimedes you wouldn't have Pythagoras. In other words, tools have to be built, machines that amplify our ability to reason need to exist. And so they're completely compatible. I think it is true, though, that most academics I think, would say that we've moved a little bit too far on the industrialization route. I mean, the Archimedean impulse is a little bit too strong. It's maybe much too strong, a bit like the tail wagging the dog at the moment.And given that you need that sort of Petri dish of mutant concepts to be emerging all the time, some of which are really useful, if you spend all your time in production, and not enough time in creation, eventually, the sources of our inspiration or ideas will run out. And I think, again, on the landscape, SFI is there to be that Petri dish. It's there to support the Pythagorean impulse, and I do view these things in very complementary terms. I don't think you want every place to be like us, but you need us. I was very struck by one of our founders, Murray Gell-Mann's classical archetypes. He was very interested in what he called the Dionysians, who are essentially seeking immediate insight into reality to experience it directly. He contrasted those to the Apollonians, who took those insights and abstracted them and distilled them, and were interested in a much more rarefied product. But in between the two were the Odysseans, the explorers who enjoyed the sensual pleasures of the immediate, but were in communication with the gods. And that's sort of what we're after, right? The Odysseans. That's a  classical reference I find useful.Michael: It's interesting because again, to bring this back to ... In a way, that is a complex systems definition of diverse models that are performing a kind of collective computation, where we look back even into antiquity, and it seems as though the real action going on evolutionarily is in some combination between all of these different approaches to reality: the temple religion versus the wilderness mystics, etc. And it feels as though there's a modern instantiation of this in the relationship between complex systems science and machine learning. I mean, it seems as though those are ... I've heard you describe this as,bv these are like sibling disciplines.David: Yeah. So there's two issues here. Right, to answer this properly we have to understand what complexity is, and complexity is this domain of reality that straddles the very regular and the random. And science has been really good at those two limits, right? And so one limit, classical mechanics, and the other limit, statistical mechanics. And both are powerful theories, one dealing with, if you like, crystals and the other one dealing with gases. The perfectly ordered and the very disordered. And in the middle is where it all gets complicated and complex, and that's where we live at SFI.Now, what that's done, because science is not very good there, historically, is generated two possible approaches. One of them is complexity science and one of them is machine learning and AI, and they do different things. Machine learning and AI takes all that complexity in, encodes it in big models like deep neural networks, and makes predictions, but those predictions are completely opaque and don't give anyone an understanding as to how they were reached. On the other hand, you have complexity science, which tries to, in Murray’s language, take “a crude look at the whole.” It tries to find the right scale at which you can do theory of these adaptive systems, if you like, in the center, with a view to not producing perfect predictions, but generating real insight, explanation for why they exist.And I think we're now entering in the 21st century, a new kind of scientific schism where we're going to live with two very different ways of engaging with reality. A machine-based, high-dimensional, very precise predictive framework that is a black box … and ours, which is a more familiar framework from the history of science, if you like, but that is faithful to the complexity of the systems we study, which doesn't predict so well, but does allow us to understand the basic mechanisms generating the phenomena of interest. And that's where I think complexity lives, and it's going to have to come to terms with living with machine learning and AI. It's almost as if we've returned, to use your biblical metaphors, to the Cain and Abel, and those two brothers are going to have to get on as opposed to one killing the other.Michael: It's funny because it's a very different situation than – to make this somewhat institutionally autobiographical – than we were looking at in terms of the application of computational resources at SFI in the ‘90s, and the legacy of this organization in terms of popular texts that have emerged around cellular automata and that kind of thing. So it seems as though there's a very clear, shared origin story there. One thing that I'm constantly drawn to is this question of whether there are pulses in almost like a market sentiment analysis of just how unified our knowledge can be, to bring us somewhat back to where we started. And that we're at a moment in history now where maybe we're in one of these pulses where we're overwhelmed by new methodologies and new data, and we're at a point of differentiation rather than integration, or do you think that's over-simplistic?David: I don't know. I think the history of insight is building physical or cognitive artifacts to allow us to reason through complexity. When you go back to the earlier SFI, it said the big problem is emergence, right? So the history of science is the history of reduction. To understand is to take something apart and look at its constituents, so when we’re kids, someone gives us a radio or a car and we just take it apart. And there is some insight to be had by looking at what makes something up, but the harder problem is to put it together again, right? And that's emergence, right? That's the other side. That's the construction side of science. The history of science is reduction, the future of science is emergence. SFI in its early days, if you like, was trying to come to terms with how simple systems spontaneously generate structure, because we felt it would help us reassemble the radio. And I think it has. And what's happened over the last 30 years is we've developed better and better tools to give us deep insights into emergence – which if you like, is the practice, the intellectual practice of understanding the origin and construction of adaptive form.And it's become more empirical, right? We now know more from empirical work to couple with those early toy models. I think that's really key. I mean, if you think about one kind of science it's the LHC, massive particle colliders that break things into the most elementary constituents, and we are at the absolute opposite end of the spectrum. We're saying, what constituents when combined with appropriate rules produce completely novel kinds of structure? And what are the right theories to allow us to understand that? And that's SFI’s game.Michael: So in that sense … we’ve spoken about this before, about differentiating models and theories, and then also the difference between, say, prediction and understanding, which you've touched on already here. So obviously these exist in some sort of ecological balance, and I'm curious, do you think that we're shifting into a new practice of science in which models matter more, theories matter less?David: I do think so. And it comes down to utility and prediction. So let's try and make that distinction clearer. So let's imagine a billiard table (or a snooker table if you were raised in Britain). You can build a model of that and turn it into a game that you can play on your phone without understanding the fundamental theory of the conservation of energy and conservation of mass, right? You put into those models Newton's laws, and you have a frictional surface, and you have near perfect elastic collisions, all the things you put in, but to understand where that comes from, where those laws come from that allow you to make your game, you need to understand the second law of thermodynamics. What is entropy? What is friction? What's happening there that the ball eventually stops on its own, right? And that's not obvious; that doesn't fall out of classical mechanics. Where does the conservation of energy and mass come in? Why doesn't the ball just spontaneously evaporate? Well, to understand them, you have to go back to fundamental principles of symmetry that were worked out by the mathematician Emmy Noether. So theory, in a sense, is giving you the bigger insight into why the rules that you're using are possible in the first place, but that doesn't necessarily make a better game. That doesn't make a better billiard table. And that's always been the challenge.Where that was reconciled, in a sense, was in the creation of the transistor out of the vacuum tube in the history of digital circuitry, where an understanding of quantum mechanics, the principles and theory, actually helped. And that's always been a tension. And so given society's obsession with immediate gratification, the model mind, the modeler, the person who builds things that are immediately of utility – or pleasure, in the case of a game – tends to be emphasized over the reason why the model can exist.Michael: That also seems to play into an evolutionary theory about a trend towards reduced algorithmic complexity in our models. It shows up in science as parsimony, as aesthetic, and that ultimately there it is again, that sort of bedrock into, in some sense, an ultimately aesthetic concern. I know Sabine Hossenfelder has talked about this, whether or not beauty is leading the practice of science astray. I mean, do you worry about that?David: Well, I actually think, again, that's sort of a topic for this series is would I call complexity aesthetics? There's a standard scientific aesthetic, which is really, in some sense, best represented in modernism and abstraction, very minimal. Think Mondrian, right? Think analytical cubism or synthetic cubism. But you know what, there were other traditions too, like the baroque, which is not like that. That’s also aesthetic. There's a very interesting question moving forward in the mathematical theoretical sciences, whether or not there might not be another kind of aesthetic that isn't so beholden to the austerities of modernism.I'm extremely excited about this. I actually think one of the things that we might explore is this new aesthetic, this new aesthetic of complexity, which is still an aesthetic. Sometimes it irritates me that mathematical physics hijacked aesthetics in the service of only one artistic tradition. And it's an open question, I think, to most of us here, whether the sort of minimal notion, the sparse notion of beauty is the correct one for the complex world.Michael: Again, it gets back to that issue of sufficient complexity in order to adequately map the phenomenon, right? There's something about that when I look at the curve there, the sort of parabolic arc between something that is all description and something that is all investigation, like open-ended inquiry, that reminds me of the way that SFI has historically talked about life itself as a phenomenon that occurs right there at the threshold of criticality. It's perhaps crass, but to the degree that we can describe this as a sort of appropriation by physics of biology and of neuroscience, do you see the work that's going on here as a symptomatic or recursive in some kind of way? That we're not at the wheel anymore, that we're moving towards an attempt to optimize strategies for navigating an uncertain world?David: Well, I mean, let's get back to this notion that was in the early days of SFI there was this debate – and I remember reading a transcript where Stanislaw Ulam, one of the tutelary geniuses of the institute in a sense, at least his spirit made the following observation. He said, "Ask not what physics can do for biology, but what biology can do for physics." And I think, in some sense, that sums it up, because we're very used to the idea that the more, if you like, mathematically rigorous disciplines are nursemaids to the more descriptive ones. But actually, now we've entered a world in the world of complexity where the opposite might be true. Where the insights for example of evolutionary theory, and in particular, its mathematical form, might be necessary for physics to advance, and it's just not something we're used to, and it might change the practice of physics. It'll probably change the whole discipline of physics. I think we're very interested in that disruption. So when you talk about exploration and uncertainty, one of the uncertainties that we of the community have to embrace is the possibility that the fields that we've come to know and love and deploy are going to be taken to pieces. And that would be wonderful. In fact, that's what science is all about.I mean, science is the most, as I said, disrespectful activity created in the history of human culture. It's fundamentally disrespectful of everything that came before it. If it is respectful of what came before it in some deep sense and beholden to its history, it will not advance. I mean, that's almost like another difference between the humanities and the sciences. The sciences are this kind of very petulant, almost childish rebellion that's necessary for discovery. And sometimes, as you know, the personalities have to reflect that cognitive requirement. And so I'm very interested in that idea. I'm interested in disrespect and challenging authority. I think it was Richard Feynman who said something like, “Science is the belief in the fallibility of experts.” That sort of idea: that nothing you're told is really ultimately true until you've proved it yourself. I love that idea, and I think sometimes the way we're presented as academics, as authorities, as holders of the truth of perpetuating bodies of knowledge is extremely regrettable. I would like this to be an environment where everyone's constantly kind of feeling a little itchy and ready to go into combat for their own idea in a somewhat civilized fashion.Michael: Odysseus.David: Yeah, the Odysseans. But at the end of it, make genuinely new discoveries that challenge the existing bodies of belief.Michael: So here's a real brick and mortar example of this, it seems like this is a symptomatic of a larger cultural movement from an emphasis on, as James P. Carse would put it, the “finite game” of accumulated merit (largely a narrative past oriented historical enterprise that you're putting in the humanities), and an infinite game of endless cultural renewal – a sort of phase shift again, where we stand here at the beginning of the 21st century on the precipice of moving out of a sort of solid model of knowledge into, like, a fluid model.David: I think it's always been fluid though. I don't think that's temporal. I think that there are factors or elements in society whose job is to maintain fluidity and to challenge sclerosis and status and the settled. SFI lives a little bit on the peripheries of the mainstream, because it's that fluid element. And I think there have been other institutions that have played that role historically, but it requires a special kind of mind and disposition, a special kind of support, to allow that kind of thing to continue. But I wouldn't say it's about the modern world, I tend to think that's overstated when people say this. It's always been true. There's always been a central core dogma, and on the periphery those who assaulted and challenge it with new ideas, and we are absolutely on the periphery.Michael: So in that sense, the concrete example that I can think of to wag our own tail a little bit here is how SFI is now, through Complexity Explorer, the educational program, about to launch this Origins of Life course. That is a course where it's very clear to see that it's not an education about a settled field that someone has to come into from the outside like a crusader and then topple. It's an area that is still, if we're talking about this with a volcanic metaphor, it's still molten and it's still running, and that marks a kind of a pedagogical shift from an emphasis on what is to what might be.I'm curious, what do you think as far as this particular origins of life course, how do you see that as a sort of exemplar of the intellectual activity of this place? And also, this might be kind of tangential, but what do you see as the great questions remaining to be explored in this area that are, in their way, so core to the bigger questions that are explored here?David: Yeah. I mean, one of the questions is what are the fields that demand fluidity? That stand to be disrupted or challenged or require an infusion of novelty? And the origin of life is clearly one of those. It's a field that's rooted in the singular nature of DNA-based lifeforms now. I think SFI's contribution to this is to expand the concept of what life itself means. And after all, what we would ultimately like to know is, to what extent is life on Earth unique – and to answer that question in a principled way, we need a definition of life which is not bound to the chemistry and geology of our Earth.So it is a good example because it's a field that's open. It's a field that's very expansive, and SFI has a long history in analyzing this problem from very different perspectives. Early on, artificial life was, "Okay, let's build life in a computer." What does that even mean? Some people would say that's not possible because life is building life. It’s a cheat, because computers are built by organic life forms. It's not the origin of life; it’s the origin of something else. And that's an interesting question, and [inaudible] would say no. If you set up the conditions appropriately, that's no different from doing an experiment in a lab, which after all was also built by a life form.So yeah, I think the distinction I often like to make – that captures the origin of life, the origin of consciousness and intelligence, and many systems we study – is between, let's call them the biological naturalists and the functionalists. The naturalists say, “There's only one way of making something. It's not life if it isn't made out of these components, it's something else.” The functionalist say, “No, there is a computational mathematical description which transcends material, and what we would sometimes call universality, and that's what we should be searching for. And so we can make a superconductor out of many different materials. It's not rooted in one, even though it might have been discovered in one.”I think that tension plays out a lot at SFI between different communities, especially our relationship to other institutions, because we tend to believe in universality. That there should be theories that transcend matter. It isn't that they're not rooted in it, but not in one particular form, and there are other institutions that tend to focus on one. It's the dialogue between those two in origin of life research that actually makes it so interesting. If it was only one side or the other, I think it would feel a bit stale, but the fact that we're constantly at each other's throats makes it kind of exciting.Michael: Looking forward to this interview series, what are you most excited about – in terms of like, what can we expect from studying the personalities, the biographies, the origins, the destinies of this scientific research community, the Miller scholar authors involved in this…? Are we just walking into a great open question here?David: Yeah. I hope so. I mean, I think in part it's to allow people to see inside of a very untraditional community of mavericks and how things really work. When we go to school or university we're given this highly sanitized introduction to ideas as if they were produced by some disembodied Vulcan, like no emotions and never made mistakes and never got involved in arguments, and it's just not true. And so part of it is the humanity, if you like, behind inquiry, I'm very interested in that.And the other is the kind of science we do. I think people don't learn this in schools yet, and the next generation will, because we're starting to write those textbooks, we're writing those monographs. But for those who haven't yet been exposed to complexity thinking, it will be exciting and perhaps surprising to know that an economy can look like a brain, surprising to know that cities are like giant organisms. These are insights that we've made over the last, let's say, 20 years, and haven't diffused out into society, and I think the combination of the kind of fallibilities of individuals in pursuit of almost impossible questions should be of interest to people.Michael: So really, to challenge assumptions, to encourage curiosity.David: Absolutely, at every level: community, individual, collective, intellectual. There is a world of individuals on a mountain in the high deserts doing very strange things in the world of knowledge.Michael: Well, this will be fun.David: Excellent, right.
1,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Welcome everybody. This is exciting. I know that Jenna just named everyone, but we'll go down and everybody can have an opportunity to introduce themselves real quickly, and then we will get into the meat of this especially tricky issue. So I'm Michael Garfield and I run Santa Fe Institute’s Social Media.David: Yeah. I am David Krakauer. I'm the president of the Institute. I work on the evolution of intelligence and stupidity on Earth.Chris: I'm Chris Kempes. I'm a Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. I think a lot about how the physical laws interact with biology, how we find systematic patterns in laws across all of life.Sarah: I'm Sarah Maurer. I'm an Associate Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry. I'm from Central Connecticut State University, and I do a lot of wet lab chemistry, so I build simple models of cells, and look at what kind of lifelike properties they have.Michael: So what we have here on the panel is a rather diverse group of perspectives on all of the different aspects of this problem of biology, which is: Where does it even come from? What are we even describing when we describe this question? As Schrödinger puts it, "What is life?" Right? This is still a question that's contested. So I think it would be interesting to hear from each of you. Why do you think that this particular question of the origins of life has been so resistant to a clean answer? Why is it that we're still working on this after 60 years of really pushing on this question?Chris: Yeah, I mean, I think... Well, so there's many reasons it's been a hard question. I think in general, life has been a hard question. So even until very recently, we often thought about life as very different forms, lots of individual species. Before we had an understanding of DNA and genetics, and the central dogma of molecular biology, thinking about life was much more confused. Before Darwin even thinking about life was much more confused. So I'd say in general we've struggled with trying to define or think about what life actually is and what are the right lenses to use for it, and then thinking about an origin. I think what becomes very challenging is how do you deal with the huge expanses of time?If we want to think about the specific origin of life to our current form, and what that trajectory has looked like, and then there are very hard problems about how do you go from a completely abiotic world to something simple and evolving, to all the way up to the very complicated molecular machines and machines that we have as single cells. So I think it's huge expanses of time, and then certain types of transitions that we don't have good ways of talking about, thinking about defining.Sarah: I also think that it's really challenging because we only have this one sample of life, and so it's really hard to understand how you could do anything from one example. So we're really struggling with even knowing what parts of life are a requirement for early life or for like the first living things, and what parts of life that we see today are from a long evolutionary trajectory that we develop over time, and really aren't necessary for something to actually be alive, per se. So I think finding a second instance of life will be the best way that we can actually develop the theory of life.David: Yeah. I want to come back a little. So the first point to make is that some of the terms that we use most frequently that we deploy in everyday life are actually the hardest to understand. So love, for instance or hate, or consciousness, or life, and so it turns out, somewhat paradoxically, that some of the more technical terms that we use are easy in the terms that we use that represent averages of opinions like life, are difficult. So that's one point to make. So it's a little bit counterintuitive, but broadly speaking, there are two schools here. One you could call the biological naturalists. The biological naturalists, and Sarah might be one, tend to think that life evolved only once, and that fundamentally understanding life means understanding the particular contingent chemistry of life that's metabolic replicating, open-ended evolving.The other school of which I'm a member, and Chris might be somewhere in the middle, are the functionalists, and we believe that life is a self-propagating computational element that has much more to do with information than it has to do with chemistry, and that we've created life countless numbers of times. Every time you open your computer, you generate life de novo when you run code, and the fact that it depends on the energy we supply is no different from the fact that life on Earth depends on the energy the sun supplies. So it's worth bearing that in mind, if you like computational theories of life and chemical theories of life.I think one of the problems of the field is it's been dominated by the chemical perspective that's trying to look for the unique conditions of the early Earth, rather than be a little bit more expansive, and ask what the general principles are that you can observe anywhere, and the conditions that even prevail today in modern Earth.Sarah: I guess the only thing that I would append is that there has never been a computer that was not made by a living thing, and so we might consider that computers are just a next step of evolution of the only life that we know, and maybe it has a different type of information, but it is really just an extension of Earthlings, and so is it really making life every time you turn on a computer or is it just like giving birth?Michael: That's an interesting point that leads into this question that I had in high school biology when my teacher said, "Okay, viruses are not alive. This doesn't count because they require a host in order to reproduce," right? "They require a context," and I was like, "Wait." At 14 I was like, "Wait a minute. I require a space suit. If I leave the atmosphere, I require this complex supply chain that produces all of this food, and even if I'm growing all my own food, I still require a microbiome to digest it."So this question of context I think is an interesting one, and given that all your work is being done in, like you said, a wet lab, I'm curious how each of you think about the role of context, closure, constraint, and a distributed, I don't know, support or intelligence of the environment in this question. Especially given that so much of the investigation in this particular topic is treating this issue as though it's like a carry over of the spontaneous generation of the ancient world, this notion you can just leave meat in a jar and it'll grow flies. So like where does the context fit into this investigation?Chris: Great. So I'll start. I think for me there's no problem with viruses, and I think David would agree with this, but for me a virus is a living thing that has a very complicated ecology, has a very complicated environment that it needs for its own replication and so forth. That actually turns out to be true for most organisms that we know. So one of the great surprises of microbial ecology has been if you take almost any bacterium, say from an environment, the likelihood that you can figure out how to culture that in the lab is very low, and so the types of things that we regularly grow in laboratory conditions are things that have very simple environments and we understand what to do, but that's not true for most organisms.We can't figure out the set of contingencies they need from their environment to exist, and so I think that's one of the fundamental pieces that we need to think about for life at any scale is: What is the connection between the living thing and it's contingencies with some environment? That really doesn't matter if you're talking about a molecular virus or some sort of other living process like cultural evolution or something like that. It really is about the thing that is replicating, and existing, and evolving, and the types of environmental conditions it needs for that to occur.David: Yeah, I mean, so something Chris and I worked on several years ago, we developed a mathematical theory for this, and one of the ways you make progress in science, or I guess in thinking, is you take a concept like life, and you get rid of it, and you replace it with its constituent parts, and so we choose not to talk about life, and you can talk about things like autonomy or minimality, and that's the spectrum that Chris is describing. I think this is extremely dangerous to think of life as autonomous and something you can build because it eradicates the need to understand the ecological dependencies exactly because it's talking about...One of the ethical implications of which is to imagine that you could live on a planet with just one species, namely us. So life is an ecological phenomenon, and if there's any ever going to be a biological definition of life, it's going to have to be whole planet, and it's quite interesting if you look at a textbook on life, it never considers the ecological network. It will always say replication, metabolism, and so forth, but it's to miss the point. So the virus makes very clear that the completion of the life cycle requires a huge number of host factors, and that's no different from the huge number of ecological services and factors that we require to compete our life cycle. So actually to think of ourselves as a virus would be extremely useful. I don't mean that in a parasitical sense, but just in terms of the context that Michael's alluding to.Sarah: I think that's true that when we talk about life, we have to be talking about life from the context of the entire planet, and you can't. I studied honey bees for a short period of time, and a single worker honeybee will never be able to reproduce. Right? It lives for a very short time, and it gathers resources for the hive, and I had a lot of struggles when I was 21 and murdering honeybees every day about whether or not I was killing a living thing because it didn't really feel that way in a lot of the really definitive biological terms, but I do think that when we look at something and say, "Is this living or not?" Like an individual single instance of whether something is alive or not, that we as humans have like this gut reaction to whether or not that's true.That shapes a lot of our interaction culturally with each other and, also, the dialogues that are occurring between biologists in between different fields, right? So physicists talk about life in a very different way just because of the way that they look at something and have that gut reaction, "Is this alive or not?" So I think that it is challenging in a lot of ways to do interdisciplinary work and to really contextualize what your experiment will be addressing or what your work is really trying to achieve just because there is such a different feeling about it or a different sociology behind it.David: Can I just add?Michael: Yeah.David: So another way to say this is, and this may be a little bit gobbledygooky here, but transient forms of matter that exist in this ecological network that manifest agency, that is have purpose and function, we tend to confuse with life, whereas we should be conferring the life property on the entire graph, but what we're really doing in all of these experiments is doing experiments on the nature of agency, and it's an important element of nodes in that living draft, but it's not life itself.Michael: Sarah, do you understand the work that you're doing in terms of understanding the chemical basis for agency or, I mean, what is your... As you said, you're kind of on the side that life is append to a particular chemical instantiation, right?Sarah: I think that we're all saying that. Right?Michael: Yeah.Sarah: That it is really dependent on the exact conditions of Earth right now. I think agency is very far from where my experiments are. So my experiments are maybe building that the lines on the graph that you would then plot, right? So we're just really building the chemical context for life to evolve in, and to actually generate that next step. So I don't think that I would say I have any agents in my system, and that I can get things that will have transient properties that could be considered life or individuals that have those things that we're looking for, but we are still very far from having a single agent that could be made in any context.Michael: Something I haven't heard raised in this discussion so far is the thermodynamics of life, which I think bridges a number of disciplines. There's this growing, I don't know, momentum around this idea that life is a sort of thermodynamic inevitability because of the way that metabolisms come together and dissipate energy more effectively in a system. I'm curious what your thoughts on that position, whether you see... Like for example, is there such a thing as anti-entropy? Is that what life is doing? Is life cutting against that current of the second law or not, and in what ways might it not be?Chris: I mean, I think one way to break that question down is to ask under what conditions do you get subsets of the system that have, surprisingly, more structure, able to then harness energy from other parts of the system. Right? So that's that the thermodynamic answer. I'm not sure negative entropy is the most useful concept because I think part of this is just very simply trying to count how many states you are, and you might have, and think about the likelihood of getting a very rare, complicated state in some sub portion of the system that then can operate on other parts of that system. So that requires certain types of energy flux for that to be true.So there's not so much that the states are destroyed quickly, but also enough energy that you can maintain order, and so I think there are sweet spots for energy, but I think most of the standard thermodynamics we would think of are sufficient for thinking about living structure.Sarah: I think one of the things that you said was that it's an inevitability, and if that was true, then we would see it on every body in the solar system, right? Every place that has a dynamic, a space, we would see that there were signs of life, and I don't think that we see that, and so the inevitability of this process seems to not be true to me. I don't know a lot about the theoretical energetics, but I do think that life works with entropy in a lot of ways to have something that we perceive as more ordered. For example, oil separating from water is driven by entropy, but you wouldn't look at a salad dressing that is phase separated and think, "Oh, that's more disordered than if the oil was mixed into the water." Right? Again, this is one of those gut reaction things where we're like, "Oh, this is entropically unfavorable." So if you're not familiar, entropy is just how, how much disorder there is or how many possible states a system can have, and how many of those states it is trying to occupy. So if there's one state and that one state is occupied, that would be low entropy. If there are a hundred states and it is switching between all 100, that'd be high entrppy, and so you would think that life having many possible states, it sometimes is working with entropy. So even protein folding is, in part, entropically driven.David: Yeah. Just to build on this a little just to clarify, and that slightly paradoxical insight. I think Shawn's going to talk later in this podcast, and he has a nice example I like, but the thing that's shocking, I think... So the question Michael is asking is: Do potential differences that allow for the possibility of current flow generate as they move towards equilibrium generating entropy, complexity?" One form of transience we stabilize complexity with agency is life, and the example that Sean [Carroll] gives that I always like is you go into a coffee shop, and you get a fancy latte-like drink that has cream on the top, and coffee underneath, right? So that's an ordered state.It's a boring one, but it's an ordered state, and it's easy to describe. Now if you leave that in a room at room temperature, what does it do? If you come back an hour later, what will that look like?Audience Member: It's mixed up.David: It's mixed up. Right? It's kind of boring again, right? It's just all brown, and so you go from one boring state, which has been separated, to another boring state, but between those two states, you produce vortexes, and because you're not at zero degree Kelvin, you produce currents, and the description length of that coffee is vastly greater in the transient than it is between the initial ordered state and the disordered state, and some people would argue that the coffee cup is maybe alive just for a short while, while it's cooling down. I might be one of those people. So there's this law of the universe that's as fundamental as the second law of thermodynamics, which is the law of complexity production, which is between order and disorder.There is complexity and somehow in that state, something maybe special has to happen to the chemistry to create agency, but maybe it's already there. I don't think we know.Chris: Well, and I'd also say another nice thing to recognize here sort of building on what David is saying is using very simple chemistry and very simple thermodynamics, it's possible to get many of the features that we're interested in for life. So if you have just two chemicals interacting with a flux of one of them, so that's effectively an energy source, and you have the right decay in the system, then you will get regions of high concentration in one of those chemicals that then self replicates itself, and you get these repeating cell division and death, and you from a lot of mathematical models would say that looks like what you want to have for cell dynamics. Incredibly simple system, right? Sort of boring, susceptible to perturbations will go away easily. That doesn't take much more than very simple chemistry and a little bit of thermodynamics.Sarah: But in those systems, the number of boring solutions is much greater than the number of interesting solutions.Michael: So to this point, the question of where do we look for an environment like the environment that we imagine life may have emerged on Earth is this highly contested topic. You've got people who are really, they're on the deep sea hydrothermal vent camp. You've got the hot springs camp, and these different perspectives. They have consequences for our space programs, for the energy, and the attention that we invest in different strategies for exploring the possibility of life beyond Earth, even if we're just using spectroscopy to analyze chemical signatures of other worlds out there. So you can get armchair speculative on this, but I'd love from where you stand on this, each of you, kind of where you imagine life may have emerged and why. Like why would those conditions have been favorable compared to someone else's version of this?Sarah: In the right audiences, this would be the question most likely to start a fist fight. So yeah, some people feel…Chris: Right.Michael: You're safe here.Sarah: ...very strongly about like their warm little pond, if you will, and so I think that there are a lot of people who are pushing something that works. Their unique chemical system works in this one location, and this has to be the one. I don't feel that strongly. I think that we can make unique systems in pretty much any environment. So any temperature range, any pH, any salt conditions, even if we're talking about different liquids, so not water. If we're talking about not liquids, so atmospheric kind of systems, you can find interesting patterns and chemistries evolving in those spaces. So I'm very unbiased. I have very little in the game there. If I can build something that's cool in a new place, I would like to do that, and let's see what we can get.Michael: And that's how you avoid fistfights, folks.Chris: Yeah. I mean I think my answer to that would be, I don't think we have the right theories yet to say, and I think in the history of thinking about life, the most dangerous and often wrong statement is, "Life can only do X or life can never do Y," and those typically turn out to be very wrong. So we'll never find an organism that lives at this pH or this temperature or whatever it might be, and so I think that that highlights that we don't have the right sort of theories for thinking about life, and I think those predictions get even more dangerous if you go to thinking about where life might first evolve or how many different ways or how many different environments, and how big or small that space is. I think we simply don't have the right frameworks, yet.David: Yeah. One of my favorite remarks at this conference thus far came from the extremophile cities panel where I don't remember, it might've been Nicholas [de Monchaux] that made the point. He said, "If an alien species or group of species, maybe an alien phylum visits you at the Earth, they would consider the city as the dominant form of life, and humans their microbiome," and I thought that was kind of beautiful, and I completely believe it. I'm one of those people who believes that Hamlet is alive. I think that in the environment called the brain that is capable of speaking English or middle English, Hamlet is transiently alive, and propagates itself by virtue of being such a beautiful, tragic player.So I think once you mathematize the concept of a system capable of propagating information into the future that modifies the environment in which it lives, so as to benefit itself, there are a range of different things that could be living, and I just think we have to be pluralistic. I think a very interesting one is the chemical one. Another interesting one is the pneumatic cultural one or the computer virus. If you have work on intelligence, I feel the same way. The monolithic perspective that there is only one of something is a disaster, and I'd much rather be thought about forms of life than one.Sarah: Can I actually ask you a question, David?David: Yeah, please.Sarah: So what do you think is the biggest barrier to us actually developing this model? It sounds like you think that we have everything we need to do this and that we just haven't come up with it yet. So what would be an example of something that would really kickstart this theory, this like hardcore scientific theory?David: Yeah. I think we have, so I would say that we have the mathematical theory to explain what life-like phenomena are. We have failed at creating one special kind, which is the chemical kind. So there's probably a laboratory experimental challenge that I don't think has been solved, but I think the theoretical challenge was solved a long time ago, and I think part of the problem is hegemonic. I think it's that the people who dominate the field of the origin of life are prebiotic chemists, but I actually don't think it's a problem. I think actually the theory of living systems is kind of come quite a long way, but the experimental realization is so hard. I think it's a technical problem.Michael: So there's a... Oh, go ahead.Chris: Well, I was going to say, and I think somewhere that sits in between the pure theory and the full chemical realization of a new form of life is lots and lots of interesting in silico evolution. We have learned a lot about evolutionary theory. We've built lots of interesting evolutionary models. We've come to understand a lot about what's required for something to adapt and persist simply by building simple organisms in computers, and putting those in simple or complex ecosystems, and understanding a lot about what happens there, and the theory typically holds up. I think we do have a middle regime where that has worked very well.Michael: So another way of posing this similar kind of question, and let's limit it to just the chemistry of abiogenesis. The question is around the enormous search space of chemical possibilities, and the fact that we don't actually even really know how big that space is. We were talking about this a little bit earlier. What are some of the ways that people researching in this domain are trying to winnow down the possibilities, what we are actually looking for, at least in our own life history, if not possible alternate biochemistries?Sarah: I think really strangely, instead of it being winnowed down, it has expanded and grown in maybe the last 30 years. When we first started looking at chemical mixtures, we were looking at ambient temperatures, and really mild neutral conditions that you find most bacteria in. Maybe now people are trying even more things like crazy pressures and crazy temperatures. If anything, because we didn't find an easy way in a mild solution, now we're trying easy ways in harder solutions or in weirder solutions. I think that because this didn't happen in the last 50 years, this is not easy, right? It's not that you're going to find the right environment and then suddenly it's going to happen for you unless you're really, really lucky. I don't think that thinking about it really hard is going to improve our... We've been thinking about it really hard for 50 years. Right?That clearly is not yielding fruit, so maybe we need to try some other discussion. I think that this idea of using computer modeling or even using some of the robotic technology that we have to explore to not thoughtfully, but just like spam the space, and try everything as best we can, is maybe the next mechanism. We saw big jumps with computing by doing this, right? A lot of our computational models now just kind of randomly try different things, and see how we get to the best fitness. We just need to do that with chemical complexity.Michael: That kind of parallel approach actually almost sketches out a narrative, right? An origin story, right?Sarah: Yeah.Michael: The Earth itself may have been running that kind of massive parallel experiment.Sarah: Yeah, exactly. If we don't do it on the scale of Earth, maybe we will never be able to recreate it. Let's terraform.Michael: So that's like that's like a [Jose Luis] Borges kind of issue, right? A map the size of the territory.Sarah: Yeah.David: Yeah. I object to the question. I mean, the question that has to be answered is what's special about chemistry, and a useful analogy to me is digital versus analog coding. The way to think about chemistry maybe in this context is that the Fabian statistics or the Pauli Exclusion Principle, or whatever it is that gives you discrete entities. This is something one of our faculty actually works on a lot, Eric Smith, what the periodic table does. It gives you Lego, and it gives you discreet forms of stability that can be combined into relatively stable aggregate discreet forms. What chemistry does is give you digital logic, right? And so with a very interesting combinatorial constructive aspect.That's the more fundamental principle, not chemistry. I think it's so if you can describe that concept in mathematical terms or however you want to do that. You have category theory, that's what some people are doing, then you can get at the deeper constraints about what would allow for sort of an open ended, self-sustaining process. I think, again, we should just turn things around. It's not the contingency of the particular universe in which we live. It's something more profound about the discreet fault-tolerant building blocks, and once we can realize them, however we realize them, we'll be able to create. Maybe that's the technical challenge of life.Chris: Yeah. I think building on that last idea, I mean the interesting thing to do there would... I mean what we ultimately want is a theory that says, "If I have this size of a combinatorial space with this types of possibilities, what sorts of lifelike things can I get in that? So if I design a computer system where I've specified a much smaller combinatorial space, then say all of chemistry, what then do I expect about the range of lifelike entities I could get in that system opposed to chemistry?" We want something that covers that full range, I think.Michael: Not to get super meta, but this all suggests that the study of the origins of life itself is speciating, that it may be an instance like you were suggesting earlier. These technologies are an instance of this process.Sarah: Yeah, I mean, I think there is, and all sciences do experience evolution of thought and evolution of ideas, right? We have continuously been updating our ideas on all forms of science, right? So this is a natural process. One of the interesting, more recent, I don't know, trends I guess that I've noticed in origins of life studies is that everyone used to just talk about RNA, and in my very first conference, someone, a graduate student, got yelled at because he was talking about proteins in an origins of life conference. That is not happening anymore. It has really changed, and now we talk about complex mixtures, and we are talking about RNA interacting with other things or maybe not RNA at all.I think that we have pounded on the RNA door for very long time. That hasn't yielded fruit, and so now scientists are like, "Okay. Well, maybe that isn't the right answer," kind of growth, and I think that is promising because it's unlikely that there was only one chemical on Earth. Right? Like it was definitely a messy, messy system four billion years ago.Michael: What do each of you consider to be some of the most exciting promising research in this area over the last few years?Sarah: Mine.Chris: Yeah.Sarah: No.Michael: Well, then you have to talk about your work in more detail.Chris: Yeah.Sarah: I do think that there are a lot of people who are trying to make not just one thing, but make a network of things come together from a more abstract point of view. So a lot of the artificial life work, a lot of this synthetic biology work, and we say that we're trying to create life from like modeling the early Earth, but the reality is that even using really sophisticated biology, we don't know how to make chemicals alive, right? Even using like if you destroy a bunch of cells, you can't put them back together. Right? We don't know how to do that, and so saying that we could model early Earth and do this, I mean it's very unlikely that that will occur, and so the origins of life focuses that I think are really interesting are looking at how small networks of molecules that could have been around on early Earth can evolve chemically.So the chemical evolution processes that we're seeing are going to inform a lot of the research in the next few years.Chris: I think, for me, one of the most exciting things is moving away from trying to design a very specific reaction that you think is the one that leads to an origin of life or will eventually, running that in the lab, and then being disappointed, and going more towards what Sarah was just saying about bringing in more evolutionary thinking. So I think what we've learned from evolution in the last hundred years is that it finds surprising and interesting solutions. It's good at searching spaces and so forth.A lot of that's been translated over into computer algorithms like genetic algorithms, which are largely informed by evolutionary theory, and so I think bringing that perspective to the chemical space is a very interesting one by saying, "Let's build complicated chemical environments, but let's add to that selection and variation in an evolutionary process with the hope that that helps us understand the space that that searches." So on the explicit side, I think the actual chemical reactions that people are doing that's much more interesting, and then I think there's a lot of really interesting theoretical avenues, which David has alluded a lot to.David: Yeah, just building on both of those. So I'll give you an analogy. So I'm going to claim, and I think Sara said this and Chris made this point yesterday, that we're about to experience a renaissance in artificial life. So if you remember neural networks, when I was in grad school they were laughed at, and I actually worked on neural nets. It was a joke, and then GPUs came along, and Moore's Law helped, and Big Data helped, and all of a sudden a technology that was considered a little bit naïve, these very simple computational models of nervous systems, became immensely powerful, and modern machine learning, as we all know and sometimes called inappropriately called AI, has reached a maturity, and I think the same kind of argument would apply to artificial life. I think we have interesting constraints on the simulation of living systems.I'm not sure exactly what they are. Will we be able to mobilize GPUs the way that folks in machine learning did just to model chemical-like events? I think once we do that, there'll be this huge new field of artificial life, and it'll lead to a new faction of people who say, "That's not life at all!" In the same way that folks say machine learning is stupid and naïve, and it's not really like human intelligence. Thank God, by the way. I think that that would be my hope that there's going to be a renaissance in artificial life.Michael: Any research in particular, like specific publications worth discussing in this area? You can talk about your own. I'm putting you there.Sarah: So I think what I try to do is make these small cells, and the really cool part about small cells is that each one can have a unique chemistry, but you can use different unnatural techniques to select for ones that are better, and so maybe you're selecting for ones that are persistent. Maybe you're selecting for ones that are fluorescent, and that's a real biochemical tool. We just tend to make things fluoresce when they do a specific task, and then we can pull them out of the rest of the population, and so I think that one of the things that I'm really excited about that I'm doing is working on how you can get these really simple collections of chemicals that aggregate. They aggregate into really like when you look under the microscope, you think, "Oh, that kind of looks like a cell," right?And so you can actually put these through rounds of selection, and select for different fitnesses, and I think that what we're going to see is that as we get better at making these selections... So it's a chemically challenging problem to pool the ones out of the population that you like. Once we get better and better at that, we're going to see that we can actually evolve specific features without actually having something that you would think of really as alive. Right? It's never going to escape my lab and evolve, but I can like kind of force it to evolve, and you can do this not just with my cells, but lots of different types of small individuals. So maybe like grains of sand or little oil droplets.So instead of forcing some idea of what the chemistry should be, you can kind of let it happen and see what comes out of it, and I think that that's a really interesting tool that we're going to be able to harness with the increase in our technological abilities. So as things become cheaper and as our tools become stronger.Chris: Yeah, I'd say there's a huge amount of interesting research, and so rather than highlight that, I'll just talk about our own so we highlight our own work.Michael: That's good. Yes.Chris: Yeah, along these lines, David and I are working on a paper trying to take a lot of these very abstract mathematical theories, and apply them to particular case studies, and hopefully that will help clarify this connection between a lot of the tools and framework that has been worked out, and has a lot of power, and how you start putting that into practice in very specific examples. So stay tuned for that.Michael: Okay. So all three of you have contributed to this new course, that Complexity Explorer SFI's online classes. They've put together an origins of life course that's a little different than your normal kind of course in that it is this unsettled area.Sarah: Yeah. So if you are finding this discussion really interesting and you want to learn more about origins of life, I'm teaching a course online. It's free, complexityexplorer.org, and the origins of life course will run through September. You get a certificate at the end. If you decide that you don't have time or it's too much, you're not going to be pressured to finish it. So don't stress out about it, but if you think this is interesting, go check out the course because I think that citizen scientists can play a big role in shaping how we talk about things, and how we bring ideas to the public, and it's better to have an educated public, and so the Complexity Explorer's idea of having these free open courses, it's a really good thing for everyone to be engaged in, and to at least try out once, and this would be a good one, if you're enjoying this panel.Michael: Do any of you have thoughts on like what it's like to work on a course that is so up in the air, so contentious?Sarah: Scary.Chris: Yeah. I'd say very much in the spirit of the conversation that we've just been having, in this course we've really tried not to commit ourselves to any particular historical story, and tried to really present people with the broad range of tools and concepts that are needed to make progress in this world, and so that spans, what we know about modern biology, evolutionary theory, certain mathematical concepts, some detailed chemistry, but we have tried not to tell a very detailed history.David: No, no, I love it. Just to get to your point, the only course that you want to take is the course that's up in the air. The only kind of knowledge that's interesting is the unstable form because you could actually contribute to it. If it was a little rigid and fixed, it would be totally dull and so you ignore it.Michael: So the final is to build your own cell, right?Sarah: Or write a set of equations that can be then used to predict the chemistry that is coffee mixing in a cup.Michael: No obligation. We have time for a couple of questions, if anybody has a burning question. Yeah?Audience Member: There's got to be an energy we don't understand here, we haven't explained yet, that exists. Tell me more about it.Michael: So the question for the record is from like a vitalist position, right? This question, "Why is the assumption that life has an élan vital, right? Its own life force. Why might that be a mistake according to the people on this panel?"Chris: Well, I think part of the answer is David's Hamlet example, right? So Hamlet is a certain living thing with a different transience, and in the example that you gave, the ways in which you're dead are progressing in time, right? So at first many of your cells are still metabolizing. They're still active. If you measured those, you wouldn't necessarily able to tell that the body had died, yet. If you measure circulation, you can tell that something's died. If you measure mental activity, you can tell even quicker that something's died. So I think it is a question about this transience, and what environment is maintaining a particular type of set of states or process? I think that can be explained very physically.David: Yeah. So I do disagree with you. I think Chris is right. It does require new thinking and new theory, but it's not about energy. It's about information, and that's a very important distinction to make. So what's happened at different scales of your organization is that information is ceased to be propagated forward in time, and as Chris pointed out at the cellular level, as far as a cell in your toe is concerned, nothing happened perhaps for an hour or so, but in terms of the aggregate computation that you think as self awareness, that has been significantly compromised. There's no energy issue here. It's a computation informational one, and it's one that exists uniquely at a level of aggregation that you're aware of. So we need theories for that, but it's true. It's a challenge, but it's not about energy.Sarah: I think this is another problem with how we talk about science versus how we think about our own lives, and so you think that if you were shot and buried that you are dead, but maybe if you had children you would actually still be alive. So if there's a single cell and it divides into two daughter cells, is the single cell still alive or is one of the daughter cells the single cell or are both the daughter cells, the single cell? So I think how we define ourselves being alive is only a unique production of our consciousness, and maybe if you had children and your information is still out there, and the way you raised your children and that is going through time, then maybe you are still considered alive from some perspective.Michael: Yeah. To that point, also, David Eagleman wrote this fantastic book, Sum, which is what he calls “possibilian” philosophy, which is, “Well, we don't know, so let's investigate all of the different options.” And he writes something 40-something different versions of the afterlife, and one of them draws on this kind of pre-modern understanding that you die when people stop remembering you, when people stop telling your stories, and that there is... I think that speaks to this postmodern construction of life as an informational process, but in a way that doesn't limit the investigation to a particular contemporary scientific thing, but is able to draw on the cultural diversity of these perspectives.Yeah. So this guy just died and fell in your lap. I'm sure you have a question.Audience Member: I'm a little traumatized, but I’m okay. What do you think about the Great Filter hypothesis and how that’s why we aren’t seeing any extraterrestrial cultures?Michael: So again, for the record, the question is: If life is likely, why don't we see it? And then there's been this conversation around the notion of a great filter that there may be these crucial moments in the evolution of a biosphere at which point things are more likely to collapse, and that we just haven't gotten there yet, or somehow, we've dodged all of them so far, and so what are your thoughts on that?Chris: Yeah, I'm going to fall back on I think there's lots of probabilities in the Drake equation, which is really just a nice way of formalizing the overall probabilistic thinking of getting complex life or communicating complex life. I think many of those probabilities we don't have a good sense on, and I've seen convincing calculations that bound many, many orders of magnitude in that probability by pretty careful reasoning about individual terms, and what the lower and upper bound on that could be. So, one place where we were very wrong, for example, was the number of stars that have planets, right? So it wasn't so long ago that we discovered the first star, I mean the first planet around a star that wasn't our own, and at that time the thinking was, "Okay, great, we verified it, that this happens.""Maybe one or two percent of stars have planets," and then that probability has crept up all the way to effectively one. Every star that we see you can make a safe guess has a planet around it, and so that radically shifts the probabilities from something that's maybe close to zero to something that's one. I think how easy it is to go from a single cell organism to something with a slightly more complicated architecture, like a single cell eukaryote to multicellular life. That overall process, again, we don't have we have a... We have one historical perspective on that. We don't have a really good general theory for that sort of thing. So I think all of those probabilities or many of those probabilities are begging for more general thinking that we just don't have yet.Sarah: I think there's a really expensive way to figure this out, which is doing missions to other places, and so if life evolved on Mars separately from the life on Earth, we might find remnants of it as bacterial fossils or something like that. Right? So, we are plan... NASA, not me, I'm not NASA, but NASA is planning a number of missions to moons and to Mars, and so we may actually end up seeing. Without having to account for a great filter, we might actually end up seeing some of these life forms that are no longer alive. So remnants of life, and that might inform a lot of what we know about these probabilities.David: I think Chris, to sort of build on this, just to hammer it home. So what was it like two decades ago?Chris: Yeah.David: We didn't know that there were exoplanets. That's 20 years. Now what have we got, 20,000? I don't know how many, tens of thousands of them. That's 20 years, and now we have to work out a means of determining whether there are spectral signatures on the surface of those planets that correspond to what we think the chemistry of living systems is. I think it's way premature about great filters. I think that I'm going to put money on the table with you as a witness, now. I'd say within a decade, write it down, it's a sport person's bet, within a decade…Michael: June 16th.David: ...we'll find out-of-equilibrium spectral signatures on exoplanets that are consistent with life even as we know it, and so I don't. I think it's premature.Audience Member: Where does the self-organizing system shift from, well, shift to life? Is it possible that we just want to call life something that we can relate to?Michael: So if I'm to get your question right, as a philosopher, the question is: Is life emergent or is it a quality of self-organizing processes wherever we find them? Which, again, I think we run the danger of retreading some stuff here, but I think you got it in a little late.Audience Member: Yeah, totally. Guys, I missed the first half, so…Michael: Yeah.David: Yeah. We answered that right at the beginning in depth.Michael: But did life emerge more than once? In which case, we might have a problem of competitive exclusion of your question here. So, I don't know if you want to try to take a different angle on it.David: I mean, I will say one thing. So I'm very sympathetic to that perspective. So we develop mathematical lenses, if you like, and what that mathematic... It's a little bit like Giulio Tononi’s work in consciousness, if you're familiar with that, and so you develop a mathematical expression, and think of it as a lens, and you look at the world through that mathematical expression, and if you see nothing through that expression, you're not seeing this life form, and we develop a variety of such lenses, and by holding them up to exactly what Chris is saying, by holding them up to reality, by looking through them, you find a certain kind of life according to the axioms and definitions that go into that mathematical expression.David: So we have definitions of life that are captured by these quantities that we think we will observe, for example, in computer code, and so then that would be by a rigorous operational definition and legitimate form of life. Is it the fundamental form of life? Maybe not, but it's a form of life. So I think one can actually answer that question very mathematically and quite rigorously.Michael: Yeah.David: Yeah.Chris: Yeah, and I think a lot of the way this may shift in time will perhaps happen in the same way that chemical thinking shifted throughout human history. So, originally people thought water was an element amongst other elements, right? It turns out water is not an element. There's a more fundamental chemistry. There are fundamental building blocks, but water does capture a certain phase of matter. It captures a very complicated physical idea, and so there was something to that, and so I think it may be that as things become more formal, we understand where something like life sits in some spectrum like that where there may be more fundamental things underneath, and there may be more complicated higher order things we use to explain it, but I think the phases of water is a nice way to think about how we might eventually come to understand life. Yeah.Sarah: This is really outside my realm, but I think the one thing that you did capture is that when we talk about emergence of life, we often correlate it with or compare it to the emergence of consciousness, and so these two concepts are two really good examples of how really simple mixtures have properties that you would never predict. So that's what we mean by emergence, right? The chemicals themselves aren't very interesting, but they make these really interesting structures. Whatever terminology used philosophically to describe the emergence of consciousness, we would probably also apply those to the emergence of life.Michael: Well folks, this has been fun. If you feel like you're unsatisfied, again, where we've got the origins of life course at complexityexplorer.org, and then if you want to listen to this again, we will be starting up the official Santa Fe Institute podcast later this summer. So just stay tuned, follow SFI on Twitter or whatever it is that you do, and we'll be sure to let you know about that, and thanks everybody for participating.
2,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Well Sabine, thanks for joining us.Sabine: Yeah, sure. Pleasure to be here. Thanks so much.Michael: So you work on swarm robotics, and let's just get this right out of the way. You know a lot of people, their introduction to swarm robotics was The Matrix: Revolutions. They're not thinking about it typically in terms ... Or, like, Terminator: Genisys. They're not thinking about it in terms of medical applications, construction applications. So I'm really curious to hear from you what are the most exciting deployments of swarm intelligence in robotics and elsewhere that people are working on right now. And then we can work backwards from that.Sabine: I'm excited that swarms, I think, are ready to get out of the lab. So for the past 10, 20 years we've been building up towards swarm robotics. So we've been looking at nature and what algorithms nature uses to self organize systems, trying to implement them on robots. And typically we've been doing that in small numbers.And now the push is to understanding how we can make these things work in larger numbers. And we're starting to have these capabilities because the hardware is there, and our ability to discover new swarm algorithms is there as well. And so a little bit like the area of machine learning has taken off because we have this conjunction of better algorithms and better hardware. I think we're going to see the same thing in robotics. So I'm excited about the prospects because the reality is we don't yet see many of these swarm systems in the real world.So for me it's sort of the cusp of bringing together these huge numbers of hardware platforms that we can now make ... the ability to design better swarm algorithms and also the new application. So thinking of swarming more broadly than just swarm robotics, but can we start engineering swarms in biomedical applications? Should we be looking at how we engineer the collective behaviors of things like nano particles for cancer treatment? Should we be thinking of cancer cells actually as swarm systems that we can understand, but also maybe engineer so that they do things that are less harmful. Once you start thinking of systems as swarms, then you see swarms everywhere. And that's what gets me excited.Michael: So in your community lecture last night, you talked about ... That you're consulting with a company that's looking at construction swarms and that's a really interesting example. And then on the other end of the scale you talked about nano-medical swarms. So I'd love to just set the stage by hearing a little bit about how thinking about swarms differs at the macro and the micro and the nano scales and how the research from those different scales informs the research going on at other scales.Sabine: I love thinking of swarms across scales. I guess you noticed that yesterday. And there's really different ways of approaching it. I think when you have small numbers of more capable robots, then you give them more intelligence on the individual level. So in the case of the swarm construction, this is a startup called Assembler and they're trying to make robots that can navigate bricks and deposit bricks as they go along. And so these individual robots will need to have more capabilities than some of the nano particle work that I'm doing.And so how do you design the algorithm so that they can understand the environment on individual level, but also coordinate with other robots so that the system as a whole in this case can go and build a brick wall. At the biomedical side or the nano side, what we're seeing is systems that work in tremendous numbers, so in the 10 to the power of 13. Because of their size, these systems are inherently limited in what the individuals can do.And so then we needed an entirely different type of algorithm to the ones that we were thinking of when we were designing robotic systems, that were more capable individually and maybe worked in the 50 to the 100 scale. And when we're looking at the nano biomedical scale, it's really all about reaction diffusion. So things that move in very simple ways just react to their local environment. Maybe by emitting a signal that others can react to, and using those basic building blocks are actually quite similar to the building blocks that we use that in our cellular systems to develop these fully functional organisms, which are ourselves.So I think it's really fascinating how you can still get these beautiful complex emergent behaviors with very minimal systems at the individual level, but work in huge numbers. I'm also finding that as we think across these scales, actually designing some of the algorithms to make nanoparticles work together for cancer treatments made us realize that maybe we should design robots swarms a little bit better, that could also work in huge numbers. But that will require the individual robots to have limited capabilities, a little bit like those nanoparticles, simply because we won't build huge swarms of robots unless these individual agents are cheap and if they're cheap, they're noisy and they have limited capabilities. So we're learning across these different skills and lessons that I think can be applied.Michael: You know, when I was talking to David Krakauer for the first episode in this series, we were talking about this spectrum of scientific approaches. On one end of the spectrum you have like fluid dynamics, and on the other end of the spectrum, you're modeling in depth every agent in a system. This movement from the extreme granularity to evaluating things in aggregate. And it seems as though those two different kinds of science are the two poles of this scale of approaches that you're talking about.Sabine: So here's an example. We have a new European project called EvoNano, and it's about using AI to design nanoparticles for cancer treatment. And there we fundamentally have different scales. For example, we can simulate the growth of a tumor and that's an agent based model. And then we need to model those 10 to the power 13 nanoparticles and where they distribute throughout that tumor to make sure that they're impacting all the cancer cells.And there we're looking at just a tiny slice of this agent based model tumor where we then run a stochastic model because we can't play that number game with the agent based model when looking at the nanoparticles. So it's really fun because we're having to bridge together all these different types of simulation to answer these concrete questions of how you engineer the collective behavior, in this case of nanoparticles. That being said, I think there is a toolbox that does generalize across these scales.So when we engineer swarms, there's really two different things that we do. One is either we use bio inspiration, you could imagine using that across the scales from the nano scale to the more macro scale when we deploy our robots. And the other is using tools like machine learning to automatically discover the rules for your agents that give you a desired collective behavior. So in the case of the nanoparticles, it's automatically generating the nanoparticle design that gives you the rate distribution in a tumor. In the case of the more macro skill capable robots, it's automatically engineering or automatically discovering and using, in our case, artificial evolution. The behavior of individual robots that are doing, for example, a foraging task maybe in the 20s rather than the 10 to the power 13, but that toolbox is the same.Michael: So I was really impressed by your discussion about artificial evolution last night and in this case, the swarm of robots, each running its own evolutionary algorithm and then swapping information with each other. And so it seems like there's two kinds of learning going on in that system, right? Because the swarm, Jess Flack has talked about this a little bit in terms of collective computation, where each agent is gathering and then aggregating information in two different steps.So am I understanding this right that this system where you're training robots to collaborate on relocating a Frisbee from one end of a little arena to the next, there's really two different kinds of learning going on there, or learning in two different scales. And so I'm curious with that.And then also with this notion of crowdsourcing design for nanoparticles, the particles are too small to contain their own intelligence but reflect a distributed intelligence of agents collaborating on their design. There's just different ways of thinking about intelligence and these systems and the way that those intelligence, those types of intelligence are distributed. So I'm curious to take a step back with you and look at this more at the meta and ask, what do you think about individual and collective intelligence being a swarm robotics engineer and how has that work shaped your thoughts on this and your own evolving thoughts on this shape the way that you kick the little Frisbee around?Sabine: I tend to think of swarms as a system, and the intelligence is endowed on the system as a whole, not on particular individuals. And so if you think of a level of intelligence that you want for your swarm, well, if you have a huge number of agents individually, they don't need to be that intelligent to get the system level swarm intelligence that you're looking for.If on the other end of the spectrum, you have those 20 more capable robots. Well, fewer numbers, maybe individually more capable, but yet the system as a whole is what I ultimately care about. And so that means that very often when we're doing the automatic optimization, for example, with the smaller swarm, what we're setting is a swarm level fitness. We want the swarm as a whole to be able to do something.For example, pushing a Frisbee. This work is really new – with Allen Winfield, Matthew Studley, and Simon Jones – in that we're evolving the behaviors directly on board the robot hardware. So these robots have GPUs, which give them enough processing power to run the artificial evolution algorithms directly on board. And so that is actually challenging, because what we used to do is we would have a computer external to the swarm run evolutionary algorithms. During my PhD, this took weeks to actually do, and then we put the best behavior on the swarm.This suffers from a reality gap because very often you put it on the swarm and it doesn't do what you thought it would do based on the simulations, because the real world is complicated. And so you need to design a different type of evolutionary algorithm if you're going to run these algorithms directly onboard individual agents in the swarm. First of all, because there's no godly view of that system.So that swarm level intelligence that I'm trying to optimize, actually the individuals don't see that because they're only looking from their local perspective. And so they need to give a score to the rules that they're evolving based on what they see locally is a good proxy for a swarm level, assistant level swarm intelligence. So that's one challenge.And then the things that they evolve, they need to figure out how to share amongst their peers so that good solutions are propagated. So it's called an Island model, how these things are evolved, and it's just really interesting to see it work actually. So in just 15 minutes as opposed to the two weeks before we get a swarm going from not knowing how to push this Frisbee to something they can operate as a collective in a swarm sense. But the way I think of these across scales is really looking at the system level and then trying to figure out how you design these rules so that every individual can contribute to the swarm level of fitness.Michael: So how does this differ from the way that people are talking about training fleets of autonomous vehicles, for example? Is it a similar? Or perhaps, how do you see this differing from the way that we as individuals are constantly evolving our models of the world, sharing those models with each other, and refining those models? Because one of the robots swarms that you talked about last night actually included a peer sensing opinion algorithm where they were checking in with each other. I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of that.Sabine: Well, if there are going to do onboard evolution, they need to have a good model of their world so that they come up with solutions that are actually going to work in their world. So part of evolving these behaviors directly on the robot itself is so that you could imagine putting them in the wild, and then building up their own model of the world that makes sense, because they're there and they can measure it and they can do something in it and see what the effect is.And so in theory, they could improve their own model of the world, use that to evolve a better behavior and then deploy that directly on the go as they do that. So it is important for these robots, sometimes at least the more capable ones, to have a good model of their worlds. I think there's also ways in which we can develop good models of the world by sharing information.So the decision making algorithm that you're referring to allows robots in that case with more limited capabilities, but because there's many of them sampling the environment for example, good quality sites or bad quality sites or good quality decisions, bad quality decisions, they as a collective can come to a model. It's not really a model of the world, but they can come to a decision about the world that's just based on all these different information points that they're able to sample. And in that case, they're very simple rule sets. So it's not about creating a complex model of the world. And yet the properties that emerge make you believe that they have a good model, a good model of the world, but it's just aggregation of useful information in space and time.Michael: Did you come into this research with these ideas and this way of seeing the world? Again, you talk about when you study swarms, you see them everywhere. Did you get into this because you were fascinated by that system level intelligence or what brought you into engineering robot swarms in the first place?Sabine: I was lucky to take a course by Dario Floriano. He taught bio inspired artificial intelligence when I was a master's student. And actually I now teach bio inspired artificial intelligence to my students at University of Bristol. And then that led me to go to Carnegie Mellon University for a year, for my final master's year, and I joined Manuela Veloso RoboCup team, so playing robot football. And at that time they were leagues with robot dogs, the Sony AIBOs.And it just got me so excited about this idea of making robots work together. As part of our team, I went to the US championship, which the team won. And you would literally jump up and cry when these robot dogs would score a goal. And so I went back to Switzerland to Dario's lab with the goal of making robots work together.And so that's really what got me into this area of swarm robotics. And at that time I was doing swarms of fine robots to create communication networks and things like disaster scenarios, and trying to find the algorithms to make these robots coordinate even though they weren't meant to have GPS. And so they needed to be quite creative about their solutions. And then I thought, "That's 10 robots and we keep going on and on about these larger swarms that you see in nature."And we just weren't developing that on the robotics side. So I looked for another robot platform and I spent three years in a lab that made nanoparticles for cancer treatments, with Sangheeta Bhatia over at MIT. And that sort of was the bridge between the scales and starting to see things a little bit differently. And I was also lucky to go to Radhika Nagpal’s lab every week over at the Visa Institute at Harvard, just for robot fix because I was committing myself in the nano and biomedical world and I needed to get back to the things that I knew. Sometimes that's a healthy thing to do.And she was developing this kilobot swarm which was this 1024 robot platform, so it's called a kilobot because instead of a kilobit it's a kilobot. And it just made so much sense that we have these nanoparticles in huge numbers and limited capabilities. Radhika was developing the hardware to be able to do some of these experiments with large numbers of robots and taking the legacy of what I'd done with smaller numbers but more capable robots, and seeing how we could bridge these different worlds and build the tool suite that could help us address some of these questions of more generally, how do you engineer a swarm across scales. And so that's really how I got about it. People wonder if I've jumped to different fields, but actually I feel like this swarm engineering is the thing that ties it all together. And ultimately these are different agents with different applications, but the same mission of swarm level intelligence.Michael: So Albert Kao, one of the postdocs here who studies collective behavior, a lot of what you're saying here reminds me of a paper that he collaborated on recently that showed that there are instances where you actually don't want the agents in a network to be that smart. That the collective intelligence starts to break down if the memory of an agent is too long, if it's not adaptable. And of course, you listen to research like this and at least two things come up for me.One is what does this tell us about human collective intelligence and human behavior and human society and the way that we structure things. And then another is, in what ways does it not tell us anything? In what ways does behavior at a given scale really only have import to other phenomena at that scale. And so I'm curious how far you are comfortable drawing inferences from this kind of research into other domains, where you see this work applying in ways that it wasn't originally intended, and where you think that people are trying to stretch the metaphor.Sabine: It's hard not to anthropomorphize these swarms. For example, the decision making, you see them turn red and blue and you're ruling that they're all going to go to the right side of the forest. And my students are always claiming that they're deciding football matches or doing who knows what. So you do see these self-organized systems and you see something natural about it. Or for example, our shape formation.As you grow these limb like structures, you just can't help but see an organism as it develops. So it's true that because we see that, we tend to say, "Oh, maybe this could help us understand something about how humans make decisions about elections or whatnot." I think they can be good proxies to at least play with ideas, and because we can easily program them with simple sets of rules and visualize the dynamics on a hardware platform, sometimes that helps open the mind and you see things you might not necessarily see in simulation or in these less controllable systems.But nature, humans, and such are way more complex than the things that we're putting in our robots. So I do think we need to be careful in assuming these are good models of these different systems. It's also true that while I keep talking about swarming across scale, some of the algorithms that we do in small numbers of robots, actually most of them would break down if we did them with huge numbers of robots. Which is actually contradictory to what we usually say in swarming, which has that swarms, because they're decentralized, they're scalable to huge numbers. They're robust and individual failure, but actually many of the algorithms that we've been signing for those small numbers actually do rely on those small numbers working reasonably well. So you can assume that if you put a hundred robots and maybe a portion of them misbehave or do something poorly because they're just not working, that will skew the swarm behavior as a whole.So they might be coming to a decision that wasn't necessarily the one that they were meant to do. And so we need to do a more careful consideration of how you engineer these swarms in a way that makes them robust and reliable. The swarm engineering across scales and getting features for free only works if you really tested across those different scales and you've learned something about that system. I actually think that the things that are inspired from the nano micro world are more robust in huge numbers simply because we're making so fewer assumptions about their capabilities that there's less breakdown points on which you can fall.Michael: Yeah. You know, listening to that brings up a lot about the study of the evolution of human civilization. It gets to that issue of, how do we manage ourselves at scale? We need a different algorithm for relating to people to just throw random things in here.That's the whole thing with the blockchain thing, right, is an attempt to scale trust in trustless environments. So I'm curious, given all of that about the advent of multicellularity in these robots swarms and tissue differentiation, because it seems like the theme across all of these different systems and substrates is that you reach a certain swarm size, and then the swarm actually benefits from differentiating within itself. Do you see work being done on that?Sabine: There is a lot of work on homogeneous swarms that have the same program, but even though they have the same program, the environment they're in is going to drive their behavior. So you could get different behaviors of the individual robots based on their location and what they're sensing. With the morphogenesis work that we've done with James Sharpe over at the CRG, you essentially generate chemical fields based on two virtual morphogens that give you terrain like spots or stripes depending on how you set those patterns.And then that allows you to grow these lymph structures so it can be seen a little bit like differentiation, even though the code for all those robots is exactly the same. Just like the code for all ourselves is exactly the same. So it's quite interesting to see how from a homogeneous swarm, you get something that is quite specialized on a local scale and it's able to do its function.Also interesting is when you go to huge numbers of robots, if you want to make them robust, there's really two different strategies. Either they're so simple that it's just reaction to fusion and if individuals fail, that doesn't really matter because the other ones are just going to continue moving randomly and reacting to their neighbors. So you somehow make that system robust by making the individuals so dumb that there's not much to to attack.The other side is you have more sophisticated behaviors, and then you need to introduce some sort of artificial immune system, which actually makes sense. If you look at the evolution in multicellular systems, at some point we had to come up with our own immune system to be able to weed out back actors so that we could continue maintaining these complex systems. And so in that case, you need to actively have a system that allows you to see what your peers or other robots are doing so that you can detect if there are any actors that are breaking down or not working, because those could fundamentally alter the intended behavior of your swarm as a whole.So I think it's a really good time right now to start studying these questions of how you make these systems robust, and what you need to introduce maybe in terms of artificial immune system or checking so that you can have that work. But likewise, it could be that we designed the swarm rules in such a way that they're safe by design and individually you're limiting the ways in which that system could fail.Michael: Yeah. To take a turn into my own dark mind on this stuff. I was thinking about this last night when one of the audience members brought up military applications and was interested. I think a lot of people, at least in the general public, are interested in that and not on one side of that conversation necessarily the other. But just interested. And it occurred to me that, were I DARPA, there's really two different programs here in a way, that there are ... Like we were just talking about, two different approaches depending on how finely grained your methods are.One of them is to actually build your own swarm of intelligent actors, and another is to figure out how to co-opt another swarm. And so I'm curious about this in terms of thinking about it in the language of infection or invasion. It seems as though if the swarm is dumb enough, you can't really hack it, right? You can't actually co-opt the nano medical swarm because we're talking about very dumb random behavior. But I'm curious, how do you imagine something like a cognitive regime change happening in a sufficiently intelligent swarm?Sabine: What do you mean by "cognitive regime change?"Michael: There's so much research being done here by the people that pass through this campus on, for example, can we halt a seizure or can we change pattern of brain activity? Are there points where we have extraordinary influence on this network? What kind of research is being done on influencing the swarm that has already been designed? That's already influencing these emergent behaviors?Sabine: Yes, so first of all, on the military side, I think we need to be mindful of what we create and there's many good civil applications of these technologies, whether it's the biomedical applications, the search and rescue, the ability to use this to sense the environment or pollutants or whatnot. But we also need to be wary of applications which aren't the ones that we're intending to design.And so I think that's something that we need to be honest about it and make sure that we're mindful of as we develop these technologies. In terms of making sure the system is robust or being able to control a system, a swarm system. We're looking at research right now that aims to send in a couple of robots into a swarm, and that swarm could be a biological swarm, say mosquitoes or a flock of birds that's not going in a good direction and might hit a wind farm.And so the idea is that these artificial agents that we've programmed could go in, sample the reaction of the agents to its presence, and then extract the swarm rules from those interactions. So rather than having a laboratory setting where you have a godly view of what your swarm is doing, because you can monitor whatever the agent is doing, you would send in one or two or three agents, have them sample, and then extract the swarm model from that. And the reason it's interesting to do that is once you've extracted that swarm model from the swarm system that you haven't designed, then you would be able to potentially control it. So one example that we've been working on with Martin Homer is flocking. So that's a simple case where you could send in an agent, have them sample the behavior of other flockers, extract for example, the repulsion radius, and then using that information just by driving a couple of robots that know where to go, you're essentially pulling the flock as a whole.So there's definitely ways in which you can skew the behavior of the swarm if you know how that swarm operates, and that might be useful if the swarm is misbehaving and you want to just be able to send a couple agents in to be able to push that swarm elsewhere. It could be useful in the case of understanding and monitoring animal populations, and being able to push them in the right direction. That works for a limited subset and we're just starting to explore this, where you have an idea of what the rules are. Not necessarily for things that are more complex than that.Michael: Yeah. Listening to this, it makes me just freewheel into questions like could you inject spy robots into the construction crew of someone else's house and alter the building plan. Are there new forms of graffiti and subterfuge that can…? Of course there are!Sabine: I have a student who, just on the more creative side, I think we need to be ... People go straight to the, what if we hack it in this form to something awful, because that is ultimately what science fiction tells us. And I was part of the Royal Society’s working group on machine learning that did a public survey of the perception of machine learning. And very few people knew of the term machine learning, something like 10%. and then what was interesting is they knew the applications of it. So they knew about the fact that you could talk to your phone and it would answer back, and natural language processing. They knew about autonomous cars and they learned from it mostly from mainstream media and science fiction. So I can name so many shows that have swarms gone wrong. Whether it's, you know, Black Mirror, Love, Death and Robots, recently…Michael: Although, Black Mirror was so annoying because they had this, they called it the autonomous insects, but they were all controlled from that central Jurassic Park computer center.Sabine: I know! We wrote a whole take down of that episode, but you know, I love science fiction. I really do. And it's interesting. But I think we need to think really creatively about these swarms and the really good things they could do simply because instead of having one robot that's limited, we have many robots that could do things that we simply can't do, like cover a large area typically.So on the artistic side, since you brought up graffiti, I have a student with Paul O'Dowd who is looking at how we can use these robots forms as material that we could sculpt. And so can you develop a cool humans swarm attraction where you're moving your arms in interesting ways and that guides these materials, which is built up robots, to form different shapes.I think it's really fun to think of these as new materials, new substrates, that we can start to sculpt and model based on something that's maybe more artistic and fun. Maybe maybe a robot that goes in and does graffiti. It's not a bad idea.Michael: Well you know I've definitely read science fiction like Charles Stross's Accelerando where swarms are deployed for evolutionary housing, where the building itself changes its architecture in response to the needs of the moment where you want to sit down, and so the room exudes a chair. Is this the kind of heady, futuristic space that you fantasize into?Sabine: There's been projects on that, where you can fill out a core project about robot furniture that could self assemble into usable functional shapes. Our work in morphogenesis with James Sharpe, it looks at growing these shapes in a fully self-organized way. Right now they're very organic looking and so they don't seem that functional. But actually the follow-on projects that Danielle's doing is looking to make them more functional.A little bit like slime balls that, from this amorphous blob, can explore an environment and connect the nearest points and do all these interesting computations. I do like the idea of having swarms that adapt to the need in an environment. And there's a lot of work in modular robotics as well that have had that as a principal. Could you have a robot that self assembles into a walking robot if it needs to climb over something and a rolling robot if it needs to do something different.These ideas have been there. What's interesting with the large numbers is all of a sudden you have critical mass to actually start building shapes that are a bit more functional potentially. James came to us because he had a smaller swarm and so you couldn't see the full beauty of this morphogenesis in action. You fundamentally needed those large numbers when you're using these algorithms. And so I love the idea of things like self-forming shapes depending on needs.Michael: Okay. So you've been a podcast of yourself for 10 years, you said, at RoboHub, which I highly recommend to people who want to understand science communication done well. You've interviewed, I don't even know, countless engineers and researchers. This is an A and a B. Back to the question I asked you at the beginning: what are some of the most inspiring projects in terms of their potential implications that you see going on out of all of that? And obviously you're going to leave a ton of amazing stuff out, but whatever comes to mind. And then what aren't you seeing? What are the areas of robotics research, or research more generally into swarm behavior and swarm intelligence? Where do you feel like there are blank spots on that map?Sabine: So the RoboHub team is a very big team and actually Audrow Nash and his team now are doing a lot of the most recent interviews, but it is mind opening to speak to so many people in the field. And I love everything. It's very hard to choose. But what I'm excited about really is robots that are getting into the real world. Because I think one of the challenges that we face in public perception is that we keep talking about robots. But actually in all my discussions that I have with the public, when I ask them, "Who has a robot at work, who has a robot at home?" No one has one or very few might have a Roomba or something like that. And so we need to change that. So actually the discussions I like most are the startups that are making real robots that are getting out into the real world.And I think we need to be seeing more of that. So when you say what's missing, it's actually seeing more of that. It's seeing these robots that are being deployed and used by people.The other thing that we're missing is, after 10 years of doing science communication where we're saying that the experts need to tell their story and explain more about what the work they're doing is, I realize we need to do the opposite and actually listen way more to the public. So right now all my new PhD students start their project by doing use case studies, which I'm learning how to do as well because I'm not a social scientist. Currently we're running with use case studies with firefighters, with warehouse workers, as well as inspection experts for bridges. And just asking them, "What's your job? What do you care about? Where would you need help? What do you think of robots? What do you think of robot swarms?"And I found that these use case studies that are just so mind opening, first of all, because when you're concrete, it's no longer the realm of science fiction. You're not talking about Terminator, you're talking about, "I walk over this bridge and I'm trying to detect a crack and this is how I do it. And this is where a robot would be useful."They're actually super open minded to technology. For example, firefighters, often their media person will know how to use a drone. So they've already had that type of interface to robotics. And they genuinely see an area where their expertise is important. That's what they value themselves as. And they see an area that really they couldn't care less about stacking boxes in the back of their charity shop, for example.And so I think we need to be doing that actually way more so that we're developing the technology that doesn't have a backlash and something that we can deploy in the real world that is useful for people. It's funny because after 10 years of science communication you'd think I'd have known that, but actually it's this work with the Royal Society that just made me realize how it's done and how it should be done. So that's what I want to see more of.Michael: You know, in a way that seems to be itself an instance of a biomimetic approach to design, where you have more than one direction of information flow, where you're drawing on the collective intelligence of communities. Let's tie a bow on this here, but it seems like all this looking to the natural world for inspiration in the design of technology is bringing us to a point where it's getting harder to actually draw the line between the living and the non-living. What are your thoughts on the robotic or the technological in its relationship to the biological?Sabine: Our wet lab on the nano biomedical side is in the synthetic biology lab, and it's really interesting to see the interface between the engineering approach and living systems. And I think there's definitely, just like we're doing swarming across scales, I think we can think of controllability of agents across scales as well, and to design these systems as a whole, whether they interface natural systems or artificial systems.Again, this idea of swarm level intelligence and how you implement that at the individual level. And those individuals could be a mix of real cells. They could be a bunch of mix with microparticles, they could be a mix of an external observer that's trying to interface with that swarm. So we need to think of the system, and the building blocks of that system I think could really be broad.Michael: Well, awesome. Sabine, it's been a pleasure to be a dumb node in a smart network with you for the last 40 minutes.Sabine: Oh, that was a very smart conversation. So thank you.Michael: Thanks a lot. Where will we send people to follow up on learning about your work?Sabine: They can check out the hauertlab.com and RoboHub if they're interested in robotics more broadly.Michael: Excellent. Thank you.
3,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Luis, it's a pleasure to have you on the show, to get to sit down with you and talk with you about an area of inquiry that I think interests pretty much everyone alive on the planet today, which is the city. And I'm inclined to just go to the deepest question here, but before we do that, I'm curious how you came to getting into the science of cities? What motivated you to study this area in the first place?Luis: Sure, it's my pleasure. It took me a long time and took me a long time to acquire enough confidence and see the possibility of studying that. At a personal level, I think you brings together something I've always been fascinated by as a person.I grew up in the city of Lisbon in Portugal, which in my lifetime is a city that changed a lot, is a city that received many people from all over the world, that went through a period of rapid growth and strong inequality and a large amount of poverty, to a city that then changed very quickly and again reinvented itself, became a city that much more cultural, with less inequality, with a different identity, and right at the moment it's the city that's quite hip and unique.But it's kind of a mixture of very old, very dirty, very weird and then very new and kind of strange in its own right — and so those are some of the best qualities about cities. I think my interest also was born out of, growing up, my parents were socially and politically involved, they were both very interested in social justice. And I saw particularly my mom, she works very hard with a lot of non-profits and many different causes, and seeing how difficult it is to create change, how important it is to go to work at it every day. But how then sometimes change happens quickly and sometimes it seems like it will never happen.And understanding a little bit more about how that might happen, I thought it was maybe what I could do, I was of course a nerdy kid that liked to think about things and I thought, "We need to understand that better, why is it that sometimes things change so quickly, particularly in urban environments? And why is it that most of the time nothing happens?"Cities are these environments, I like to call them places where a lot is going on, but sometimes he feels like nothing happens, it seems like every day is the same and we're all kind of just running around and hustling around. And other times just feels, oh my gosh, it's a different reality, and in a few years, new technologies, people are wealthier, there're magic solutions to issues that affected humanity forever, like poverty or some issues, public health or social justice.I wanted to in many ways get to that. But I grew up in a place where I could not imagine coming into the social sciences, which should be the natural path and starting to study and make sense of these issues, so instead I went into physics because I thought, "Damn it, if I don't understand this now as a student." So I did, all the way to PhD. I went to do quantum physics, quantum field theory, beginning of the universe cosmology, so the harder stuff at least on the book that I could imagine, I would never understand it. And I think that was right. It was sort of in some ways the most beautiful, most mathematical in a way, but simplest way of looking at some of the most complicated things you can imagine, like the beginning of the universe or what stuff is made out of.And I think that was a great education into how the power of ideas, the power of building somewhat simple models that one can keep improving.And really this kind of idea, the thing that you can build, that science is really special and only in science could you actually have a handle on this kind of perspective, which is that sometimes a person can come up with an idea and this idea which can be about — typically the Einstein's always the example,  you're in an elevator and you're comparing how you experience fall, whether it's by gravity or whether it's the force of the elevator — and how simple ideas like this or how far or what happens when you travel in the beam of light. These ideas, we start playing with them can take you all the way to what stuff is made out of in the simplest, smallest sense like Murray Gell-Mann here at the Institute worked on and changed our perspective on or the very beginning of the very end of the universe.I'm inspired by at least daring to try to ask questions that can take us to ideas that have that kind of scope, right? That you can start locally and end up having an idea that traverses time or place. And I think when you come back to social sciences and to cities, cities are places that have this property, right?You can imagine the cities in the beginning of civilization, something changed and we never looked back in some ways, but that also have the scope for change and transformation. And so it's a very different set of ideas, physics has very little to do except in practical simple ways of what happens in the city. But at the same time asking what are these processes that cities are facilitating? What is this their scope?Michael: Yeah, moving from the specific example of Lisbon to the universal example of scaling laws as they manifest in the city — and maybe I'm jumping ahead of ourselves here, but I love that one of the ideas in your work is the city as social reactor.So I guess, this is where I would ask you, given the amount of time that you've spent on this, given the fact that you're here leading the Global Sustainability Summer School and that you're at the head of the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation, you have an idea of what a city is. So, Luis, what is a city?Luis: Good. So a city at it's most essential is really the concentration of social relationships between people in space. And these two effects, the spatial concentration, the development of course of infrastructure and build spaces and the interactions between people are mutually supportive, that's what a city is.And that can appear in a number of different forms, those social relationships may be more or less economic, that's you see throughout history that it has changed. And of course the spaces of cities can be quite different from very geometric to very curvy to taller or shorter.But the point is that by concentrating human interactions in space and time, you create a different logic for their scope and possibility and you'll find all these amplification effects where someone's imagination can be multiplied by all of these relationships.Another way of saying it is that cities is a social reactors, really they're promoting many different interactions the reactions. And this can have a can create what people call sometimes network effects by which the benefit that you collect from being in these environments is multiplied by the number of relationships that you can have, which increased faster than the number of people involved.It's a magical thing that the number of relationships goes typically with n^2, where there's only then number of people in the city. These effects show up also in technology and the internet, but in the cities they mediate that through space and time.Michael: That means that the city, it feels when you're inside a city like New York is I guess a kind of a classic American example that you're inside a living creature, but your work draws some important distinctions between the way that a city functions and the kind of properties that we see at work as a city scales and its population to the kind of scaling at work in organismal systems.And so how is the city different from other kinds of complex systems that we observe in physics and biology and why?Luis: Sure. I mean, on the one hand the city feels like it has all this life, because it's our life, right? But by being in a city we behave differently, we have different relationships and possibilities for what we do. And so you see also this kind of interesting acceleration and diversification of what people can do. The question is, is there any other system that we know maybe better or in a different context that behaves like that? And in some of my work, I tried to say that no, in many ways there are facets of this problem that you can see now that are complex systems, but it's combination of effects is really special to the city, it's really special to creatures like us.I think humans, ultimately, are creatures of information. So a lot of what our life is about is combining what we know and can do with different things that other humans can do and can know to create something that no one of us understands. So the city is an environment to do that, but it's not the only environment.Again, all kinds of technological networks have very much the same character. When we started the work, it was very typical SFI, because it started with a workshop on human and social organizations mostly. We have talks, it was a part of a joint network funded by the European Union and some people in the US. And so we brought together people that looked at cities, that looked at firms, that looked at governments, that looked at other institutions.So there were a number of very interesting talks about how all these systems worked. And there was a subset of us that got more interested in cities and Geoffery West is one of the organizers of this. But in the back of these talks, my friend Jose Lobo just kept doing the same thing, sort of the hubris of youth, saying that, "Why don't you measure that? Are you sure it works like that?" That kind of question.And so we went away started of measuring and that's how we started seeing some scaling laws that from the beginning, the first one we saw was looking at wages versus city population. And what you find, I think we all have an intuition for this, is that if you go to a larger city, people typically even on average, make more money per capita in New York city say they're in the smaller city and of course they pay also higher costs.But the point is that there's sort of, you're making more money and spending more money. And if you visit a larger city from a small city, you will see that things are more expensive that's the good expression of that. From the beginning, we knew from biological organisms that for different quantities, like energy use, that the larger the organism, the smaller the energy use per unit of mass, so their analogy seemed already to be sort of upside down.If money is energy, right, there was more money being created or exchanged per unit, per person, and the organism, there was less energy bigger than that. That continued to get us going and to start to see how that could be.And so in some sense, to tell a long story somewhat in relatively short terms, what happens, we think, at the level of organisms is that organisms, as they get larger, more massive, you tend to have an economy of scale and a slowdown of metabolism and therefore of all time scales in the life of an organism, so an elephant or a whale is longer, but also does things most slowly through the life course, than a smaller mammal like a mouse or something smaller. And that's was understood by the work of Geoffrey West, Brian Enquist, and Jim Brown and others.But that effect is interpreted really as a saving, that you wants to be efficient and spend as less energy as you can and doing a similar function. A city doesn't seem to be doing that, in fact the city is not efficient. We having a school of sustainability in part, because cities are not built to save energy.In fact, they tend to spend a little bit more energy, at least their urban systems do. But there are about all the things you could do with interactions, so they tend actually speed you up and make you go faster. Sometimes they change infrastructure and you can save some energy that way, but if you don't, then you just go faster and spend more energy.The city in that sense is not like an organism, it's almost opposite of an organism. It's built for speed, not for savings. An ecosystem is a little bit closer, because you can have more interactions and more diverse things and create a more complicated, more efficient, more productive use of energy and resources and this is known in ecosystems that more diverse ecosystems most often also are more productive.But an ecosystem is very limited by the energy that falls in its own territory, so the energy of the sun in the area of the ecosystem. If you were to compare again a rough thing, if you compare species as specializations and if you compare like types of jobs in cities, cities are incredibly more diverse and having creatively much higher energy density.If you ask what is the energy by unit time being on an area, cities have incredibly higher energies than ecosystems. And the reason again is that we import a lot of energy to go faster, so cities kind of attract all the stuff concentrated and make us go faster in terms of what we do and how we interact.And so the only system that has sort of these properties that I know of exist in nature that concentrates things, increases interaction rates and admits products at a rate that's higher, per unit of mass is the sun, is a star and that's a reactor, right?It's exactly what it's doing, it's creating light and neutrinos and other things by having the power of gravity, drawing things together and creating higher and higher interaction rates with the amount of mass in the star and that creates novelty, creates new elements all the way to carbon, oxygen and iron and other things as the mass of the star increases and those interaction rates increase. The physics of the star is limited and runs out eventually of resources and energy, but has a little bit of the same logic as you see in the city.Michael: It strikes me sitting at great distance from conversations about loop quantum gravity and stuff like this, that there are people out there trying to come up with an informational definition for gravity and that we may be approaching a more rigorous way of talking about the "gravity of a city,” it's alluring quality.The ability of a city like San Francisco to accumulate creative and intellectual capital. What does the science of cities say about a city's, I don't know, sex appeal in that way? Because I mean, you'd make an important distinction here that an ecosystem is not advertising itself to other ecosystems and trying to like recruit species into itself exactly. I mean, I don't know, take that anywhere you want to go with it.But one of the things that's characteristic of your work is that you say that you're not talking about specifically modern cities, you're talking about ancient cities as well. It sounds to me as though cities can really only be understood and as themselves creatures of a network, and that they're in communication with each other, otherwise it just doesn't make sense.Luis: Yeah, cities are basically the creation, very concentrated network in a place. But then they’re part also of larger networks between cities. It's a little bit of the difference between what can happen in a day and what can happen on a much longer time scale. Right. The stuff that gets exchanged between cities is interesting, but it's slower, right? So you cannot get a hair cut from San Francisco today here, or a meal.Michael: Not yet.Luis: Not yet, maybe one day, and we'll kind of refactor things. But the point is there are things, particularly services, exchanges of information, figuring out things a little bit, ambiguous, that proximity and speed and closeness in space and time really facilitate. The things that don't have that character, which of course is also a function of technology of course tends to leave the city, because cities are expensive places.If you can move things out of cities, you tend to through economic forces, examples on manufacturing and manufacturing often through the history of cities created in many ways modern cities with the industrial revolution, arguably are creating the big cities of China.But in US for example, in Europe and increasingly in Japan and other higher income economies, manufacturing, of most things anyway, is no longer such a value added that it can be sustained economically in cities and at the same time is understood enough, that can be moved to smaller places they don't have necessarily the same skills and knowledge, but can run the recipe in a way that makes sense economically.There's always sort of a cycle of things that are attracted to cities and then move out of cities. A more personal example is if you ask, okay, again, some people like cities, some people don't love cities in particular. If you ask, "Who comes to large cities?" Right? And there's a very clear signature that you can say this for American cities for it should have very good data, for other cities we think it's similar, but it's mostly young people that are more educated. They are coming to assemble their own network.In some sense they are coming to react, to acquire education experience from their first professional networks, elaborate on those. And often later in life, they may then move out of a larger city, either to get more space, maybe they just go to the suburbs, but often they move to other cities and then can carry the value of what they acquired, their network now gets stretched and get exported to the city.And so there's always things coming in and out, but the place where you assemble and have access to that rare is potentially but not always in reality, but potentially more valuable, more interesting things tends to be at the hottest places of these social reactors, so it's often worth it to come through and do that.Cities are very dynamical, but they're places where you are doing most of this exploration of social spaces and creating of your own space. Their attraction is not like gravity that attracts everything, but it's actually a little singular, because they attract people that want to interact, that may benefit from these interactions, that may be able to find a cost-benefit in an expensive place that makes sense for them. And therefore that becomes much more interesting to study, and a lot of studies of migration and economic development innovation are exactly about that: what sectors but also what people make sense in each place given their composition. It's much more complicated than a star, but it has a little bit some of the same at least that first pass properties.And it's interesting, because when people started studying migration, the metaphor they actually, they put into math is exactly that, that cities have a certain gravity. There’s something called the gravity law, which isn’t a law but an empirical regularity, but it says how many people come to a city and go between two cities.And that the simplest version of that is that it's proportional to the number of people there in each city. Basically, in each city you have a certain probability of going to another city and the probability of going to a specific city is proportional to the number of people there, so the number basically interactions they could in principle realize there.That actually kind of holds and has a certain explanation and allows also the whole system of cities to stay together, but it is not gravity per se, it just has a certain mathematical form that kind of looks like gravity, but it's wrong because it's more like gravity in three-dimensions not two-dimensions, so that's just a technical level thing.Michael: Well, I don't know, there's something in there — not to stretch the metaphor, where you've clearly already bounded it — in the evaporation of a black hole or something, that you reach a size and then you've grown as much as you can and then you're just slowly off-gassing people into the exurbs, or whatever.I wonder because in your 2013 paper on the origins of scaling in cities is one of the things that you talk about is that you're making an assumption about the boundedness of human effort, that a city in theory can get more and more dense and more and more accelerated in its facilitation of social interaction.But at some point like there are only so many seconds in an hour and if you look at Doug Rushkoff talking about the way that Manhattan is architecturally being really designed to look like a macro-scale computer chip in order to facilitate these high frequency financial trading processes, it's making it sort of less and less habitable to human beings.It kind of begs the question, is there an effective limit to the size of a city? Or perhaps, is there an effective limit to the size of a human habitable city? And then a new category that we haven't really seen on this planet yet, but is it possible that this thermodynamic reaction is going to lead to something like Robin Hanson the economist imagines, where we have cities that are entirely digital that people don't even live within.What do you think about all of all of this? Where does this take us? Because clearly we're not going to get, like in Star Wars there's the capital of the Galactic Republic is Coruscant, and the planet is entirely covered in metropolis.Luis: It's an entire planetary city.Michael: Right. Now, what you're saying is that, it sounds to me like that can't happen, because the city and the rural and suburban areas around it form sort of like different types of tissue and that they depend on each other. And what do you think is the end game of this massive demographic shift that we're seeing here and what kind of balance do you think we're going to strike?Luis: People love limits, right? And there are so many papers written about the city cannot keep going, getting bigger and so forth. Even back to the Greeks and they're saying this and they're thinking that 30,000 or some things to limit.Okay, so just keep that in mind — or Malthusian arguments about the size of population, where in some cities are in whole societies. In complex systems usually it's not a single thing that's going on. It's not just how much energy or somebody who can concentrate, but they're a bunch of trade offs, so some things are changing that making, bigger sizes or more interactions possible.And I think this is completely intuitive, you can study this through data and analytically, but the point is that you see that when you live in the largest city, so part of the point of the argument, in fact I tried to call it a principle in the paper, is that people change their behavior as they live in places with more or fewer interactions and this is well known to social psychologists and they've studied this a lot.But when you live, for example, in a larger city, you expect things to go faster, for example, it's very hard when I come back to Santa Fe, how long a cup of coffee takes. I want my cup of coffee to be fast. And that goes with almost everything that's more or less standard you will observe and I hope that people listening to this will do their own personal experiments, go to different places and see how certain services are faster or slower in different-sized cities and also in different societies to some extent.But we use a lot of technology also to mediate how we navigate space, the last 20 years have been amazing, right? It's very hard not to navigate a large city without a map or somebody telling you, what's the best route or what you can find around you.And also to coordinate your social encounters and your social life via cell phone they have all the time. Right? I don't really, if anyone still remembers, but you'd meet at a cafe and never know which one was the right one, there was a lot of waiting. There's a lot less of that happening.We’re kind of always cutting at the space in between, that's why people walk faster in larger cities, they're kind of trying to compress that time and at the same time finding opening up space, that's interaction space for difficult things, like the things that actually have value. like presumably at work, or your family, things you dedicate a lot of time to.We're always sort of compressing time, making uses that are essential, more efficient, this is why urban services is so important. You don't want to have to think about your water or your electricity or reliability or transportation, you just want it to be there. But of course if you go to places out that are poorer or back in history, these things took a lot of time.This compression of time is also something that's mediated through technology that then allows you to reallocate that released time to more interactions or to better quality interactions, so that's the game: as long as that keeps going on, you can keep on refactoring this and the city is sort of an intensification of the social networks, at least over some periods of time, can keep going.If you understand that that limit can break at some point for some fundamental reason, which I don't think you can for a simple fundamental reason, like the speed of light is something, then yes, you will have a ironclad argument. But in fact what you observe is that there's always been sort of a struggle to make things more intense and to work better and to substitute things that sort of more mundane into our technology and our services, So to that extent, cities can keep going.Michael: I remember visiting New York, 2005 and managing to get around without a cell phone and then 2013 praising a smartphone and Google maps. It sounds like you're kind of putting hope in the fact that in 2045, we'll have Neural Lace not to get around. That our cities will get so insanely dense that they make no sense to someone today, but we'll find new ways because the reactor of the city itself provides these innovations.Luis: Yeah and in some sense we're changing our behavior, our cognitive capacities on analytical powers, our perceptions of space and time through this process. In many ways cities are bending space and time, they're making it more intense, more full, faster in terms of the number of events and that complexity that happen in space and our ability to manage them.This is part of their magic, is that they allow things that we never thought were possible, possible, but they come through this intensification, they need to manage these very intense environments full of challenges and full of you know what sometimes psychologists called urban cognitive overload.We are always at the level of overload and always trying to cope and improve on that. And then that trickles through the whole system, not just the large city and allows people everywhere to do new things, so that's kind of very special. Of course, it will have ultimate limits, but in many ways the actual limits keep on being pushed.Michael: You brought up just a moment ago the access that people have to basic urban resources, to sanitation and basic services. You wrote a paper recently on eliminating slums and applying a network model to looking at the complexity of urban blocks and finding a really clever strategy for interventions to open up new spaces, and I'd love to hear you talk to people about that.Luis: Sure. Well, so there's a general problem, which is that in many ways as cities form, because as we described cities as a form of connectivity, right, it's a connectivity that's both physical in terms of having road accesses and street access and transportation, but having the pipes and water and electricity, all of these are kind of very physical.But then of course the social economic connectivity and opportunities that all that helps mediate and that may also has independent elements that need to be added, so as a city forms that network is forming. And when you look at slums or people that sort of at the edge of the season, sometimes socially, sometimes in physical terms, that network is not there yet. It's an incipient part of the city, if you will, in many cities of course that have become higher income and to a large extent eliminate extreme poverty, you've seen their process. A lot of places that were sort of informal, built by hands, not formally connected, were connected eventually in good ways and bad ways, but effectively address the issue.But as we look at some of the explosion of art in the growth of the last decades, we now have maybe up to about a billion people living in conditions that are just incipient in this sense and they're very exposed to climate change and other emergencies and live in poverty.But a lot of people, when you come to these places, live in hope that that process is happening quickly in their lives and that they hope that it will happen such that they can become full urbanites, but in a sense fully part of a network of entrepreneurship and creativity, et cetera, that cities can mediate.What we do is to ask sort of the fundamental question about how cities are organized in this case spatially. And so the obstacle to that thinking is that for a long time and this is, also a very beautiful, very appealing thing to do is to go around and see that different cities have different shapes. Some are very regular like Chicago, where I live now and New York, some are very curvy and some have lots of cul-de-sacs, some don't.All kinds of different cities have different sizes of blocks. And at the end of the day that matters a little bit for how people need to travel, and therefore energy use and transportation. But from the point of view of the socioeconomic products of the city, they don't matter that much.A city like Silicon Valley, which is very extended, is very rich. City like New York that's very concentrated, is very rich too. They do different things, but in some sense the interactions that they promote, have extreme value anyway and so the consequences of that spatial forum is not fundamental, even though they are instrumental.The point is, so what's the essential element of the street network? And how has this organized spatially? Essentially, it is that people have to live somewhere, in a building, if you're not homeless for most people are not homeless, they need to often work somewhere else and they need to, in a city, everyone is interdependent. You cannot grow your own food and so forth, so you need to go around space and find food, find services, work, et cetera.And so that process requires that you have access to your bigger place where you live and work is serviced, so it has water and sanitation and it’s a decent place to live and work, but also that you able to move around.And so that property is not a geometry, it's a topology. It's just the relationship that you start from where you wake up, you step onto the street, you go along the street or the subway, end up in a different place, different building and you repeat.And that just means that places, so essentially houses and offices, are connected by streets. That's it. And these streets have a certain property. But the point is you can jiggle that geometry around and find ways to create accesses to places as they exist now.And when you go to a slum you have places where people live, sometimes shacks and places that are under built, but they're not connected, they don't have street front, because of that they don't have sanitation, they don't have water, they don't have other connections, they don't have an address.And you can find by applying these principles of topology, access points that allow you to connect to these places without infrastructure to an extension of the existing network in a way that's minimal and that does the minimal disturbance and that creates curvy streets typically in cul-de-sacs.But these are the qualities of a lot of cities that we like, as they were able to develop and create services, say in old cities in Europe, old cities in Asia, and that planners thought were impossible to service with street networks, because they're too complicated and too costly.And so what we do is a mathematical demonstration that servicing these places with street networks and allowing them for it to develop and be connected to the city is possible and provide a method that allows us at least to have a first guess at the minimal rate in which that can happen and that allows a starting point for communities and their cities to decide how to continue to develop that infrastructure.Michael: Yeah, one of the things reading that paper, I was thinking about you mentioned elsewhere talking about, “What is an optimally productive city?” And in that paper you said, "Cities may be suboptimal either because they do not realize their full social potential or because they do so in a manner that renders transportation costs too high."And I was thinking well, there are two to solve this problem. One is to carve new streets, one is to change the incentive landscape that changes the cost-benefit equation for how we're able to provide services to those areas.I'm thinking of how the Metacurrency Project did a pilot project in a favela outside of Rio de Janeiro, where they gave people living in the favela bus tokens and exchanges for bags of trash. And so they had the children of the families were collecting trash and then collecting the bus tokens, and then they were able to send their parents into the city and work, but without having to actually create any additional infrastructure.And so I'm curious in light of that, and in the space between those two examples, what other genius hacks are you seeing deployed around the world that address this kind of an issue?Luis: Yeah, I think the issue is that if you start by thinking that a good city needs to realize this potential by which people can be socially, economically, civically connected, that's the basis of it.And having choice in those connections such that they can be creative, they can be entrepreneurial, that's what at the end of the day creates good cities where people feel they have agency, and through the agency and hustle end up creating new things that have new value.At the same time, there are a lot of barriers to that, both economic, social associated with stigma and then physical, right? They have to do with the fact that often in poor places people are the infrastructure, they pay with time, so basically that disabled from being socioeconomic creative agents. That's one aspect of it that we're trying to address with that work on expanding access networks.But at the same time you can also work, even if people are provided that there are good public services and that is no longer an issue, imagine that you start with a neighborhood that's socially and economically disconnected and also physically disconnected. You may create access to services and infrastructure so that this neighborhood at least doesn't have that sort of problem.But then you have the classical problem, say of the American city or some European cities, we have very poor neighborhoods that have physical access, but they're still socioeconomically disconnected and that one thing doesn't necessarily follow from the other. It is possible that by creating services, people now have time, they are able to access knowledge and relationships and therefore also have access to socioeconomic improvements in their lives.But one thing does not follow immediately from the other, right? There’s an articulating argument, but one when is not instantly provided by the physical infrastructure as often people think in planning.You could start at the other end and just start creating socioeconomic relationships as in your example in the hope that also creates physical and health conditions in neighborhoods and then you'll have a similar problem: does that actually follow or are there impediments to that?It's very hard usually for poor communities to build streets and sanitation and reduce violence by themselves and that usually takes institutional interventions and public services. But to some extent it may work, but again, maybe you can start with one kind of connectivity and develop the other or maybe you have to develop them in tandem.But again, this perspective, the city has a complex system where many types of relationships are self-reinforcing and allow people to be more creative socioeconomic agents, that then allows you to start thinking about that in a different way and what nucleates what is, you will have different paths to create solutions because these hacks, as long as they are self reinforcing a great virtuous cycles of change, then you're on the right track.But that I think opens up a lot of space to think about interesting urban interventions that are more systematic and that can take a life of their own, that are good for people, not just stay in one realm like physical infrastructure and not do anything for socioeconomic issues.Michael: I'm not going to hold you accountable for this answer, but what do you see as currently the most interesting problem for you in this space? Like right now, here at the Global Sustainability Summer School, I'm sure you're being bathed in interesting ideas.Luis: Well, there're several, I think interconnected issues. I think, from the point of view of sustainability, we're facing obviously a transition that's not just about cities, but because most people, most money, most technology are now in cities and because a lot of political will is in large cities have to do with how citizens inform themselves.Sustainability means many different things, it used to mean almost exclusively that we think about the environment and climate. And specifically we take away a lot of the carbon emissions and other greenhouse emissions that our energy systems create and some of the other pollution like plastics or evolution associated with that.But increasingly what cities are doing is to very intentionally coupling that situations of equity, so issues that have to do with inequality in particularly sectors of the population that may be disconnected and lack opportunity. And then issues actually of economic growth, where we want this transformation to not just be a substitution, right? You can imagine taking every gasoline car and replace it by electric car, we end up with the same city, right?Or replace a coal-fired power station by a solar farm you end up at the same city. Okay, that does something. But the idea is that this transformation should actually be good also to promote innovation and new invention, new business models that will be a big part of the economy of employment going forward.We just had talks, for example, the City of LA that has an initiative on clean tech, the City of Chicago that tries to couple a lot of what it does with also economic innovations. But this is all stuff that's just bubbling up. We don't know how to couple these things in a very effective way, so there are many experiments throughout the world in many cities and that's really interesting to see and that's what we're doing with the Global Sustainability Summer School.I think too, then, to become a little bit more abstract about those issues, is that cities always in transformation and the main issues have to do with firstly structural issues, how do we create cities that more enabling of more people. And I think we've been a bit in autopilot thinking often from a policy perspective that cities are zero sum games, that by making somebody's life a little bit better, somebody else needs to pay for it. And the character of cities is exactly that they're not like that, that there are channels by which people can work together, create a firm or create an idea, create a new service by which they can create value and generate growth.But you need to be intentional about helping create those channels and helping bridge, different sectors of population on this socioeconomic or racial whatnot, subset that diversity tells and he's able to create value and a better life, so cities have exactly that property because of their network effects.But often they're addressed in policy as a zero sum game. And that means that if I am going to transfer some money effectively from a rich neighborhood to a poor neighborhood, that people do this because they’re charitable and not because this can actually create better lives for everyone and create a positive sum relationship.That's very important to have that conscious, that's what cities are for, that's what cities are good at. And finally, building on all that is really a better understanding of processes of change. For example, the process of economic growth we know has a lot to do with information, same thing in biology.Evolution has to do with new ways in which life can use the energy of the physical environment and resources to do new things. Same thing with human societies. You have to say how the processes are different, but there's a similar logic that in many ways cities again are places that very starved for energy and resources that are always scarce, but they're all about information, what we use those resources to do.And that creation of new information of new forms of value creation is essential. And while we've been discussing them at the macro level, at the level of what is the 3% growth GDP for a nation or even sometimes even for a city, we do not know how to unpack that process and now ask for example, if it's Santa Fe today, was there economic growth? What were the sources? What was it for that person or that neighborhood?We don't have a way to have access to the true, macroscopic personal level processes that creating that change. And because we don't have access to those, we don't have a really good way of incentivizing them or creating essentially a process by which we can select what we do and how institutions work that are actually creating positive transformations, both economic and otherwise.And so we’re missing a fundamental understanding of how cities as these environments that create change work in a short term dis-aggregated way. And in the lack of that, we often have policies that promote growth that create a lot of inequality, because most of the resources are with rich people, so we want to give them better conditions to invest, for example. That creates actually additional value in a financial sense, but it doesn't create a better city that's better prepared for the future as a place of innovation.Michael: You think that that's something that can be routed around? Because one of the things that comes up again and again and the conversation around scaling population growth is the bigger the city, the more socioeconomic inequality. And so in a way it seems that we're constantly falling off of that treadmill by virtue of the physics of it.Luis: Yeah, it's true that as cities that create transformations, those transformations tend to be expressed unequally, but that's not just the fault of cities, it is also a fault of cities. But goes a lot through of course, structures of production, what firms do, what kind of wages and wage inequality they promote, which is basically the redistribution of a collective production, right, very Marxist perspective.But still and we know how much does the CEO make versus the medium worker or something. So there's a very interesting problem partially tackled in technology and economics. But I think coming to the for also in urban environments, which has to do with the fact that if what we produce is always collective, scientists know this well because they need to, in papers we always have many names: who should get which fraction of the value, right?Do we redistribute equally? Well, that's not what firms do for sure. Right? The CEO makes a lot more money, if we don't distribute equally, how much should each part make? And if somebody whose work is really very synergistic with their own farm or their own city, rather than just being every janitor is the same, every CEO is the same, then you have to recognize that and actually compensate people in certain ways.But we've been lacking essentially the formulas, the understanding the mathematics to think about this straight and I think I'm most excited and this is something I'm working a lot on, with this nexus between resources and information and how it's pulled together to create sophisticated things that have a lot of value on the one hand, which is what cities are so good at doing, and at the same time, how that creates a virtuous cycle where the products of this collective production continue to create better lives, better cities, and continue to create hopefully societies that are creative, that feel good, that have good quality of life for everybody, and that are in a better relationship with the planet that can be constructive and not destructive.Michael: That actually leads really neatly into the last question I had for you, which is you've lived all over the place. You've lived in London, you were a postdoc at MIT, Lisbon, Heidelberg, Los Alamos. You've seen many different kinds of city, you study this stuff. Were you to decide that you were going to relocate based on — not a job you're done in Chicago — what are you looking for? If you're just choosing on like the character of that city alone, what do you consider the most desirable aspects? Or what would you suggest to someone who is going to spin the globe and take a crap shot at this?Luis: Well, that's a very difficult question, because sometimes I say cities are like children: we love them all, right, for somewhat different reasons, but the city's also very polyphonic, right, so there are all these characters, those are bad things and good things in each place. And so I think that and as we talked about, if you go to a large city, it can be more exciting, there're more social and economic possibilities, but you pay a high cost, the thing is more expensive, you live in less space.It depends on what you want at what stage in life. When I was a student I was happy in London then, I still have very many good friends of that time in London and I see their lives, which is in some sense, exciting in some dimensions, but limited in others. Right? I think the best thing actually is to evade your question.I don't want to give you a political answer, but continue to sample what's good about different places, you can do that through travel, but you can also as opportunities come up in your life and go to a place that excites you as you're trying to discover things in your life that you may want to do and be exposed to.If you know what you want and you want some space to go to a smaller city that gives you space, Santa Fe is wonderful for that, come to Santa Fe. But if you want to scale up what you do, we may have to go to Chicago or a bigger city again to do that.Different places have certain advantages and disadvantages and it's an urban world where a lot of these places, you can bring the experience of one place to another and that's a very enriching quality, So enjoy that. Enjoy that possibility of being in many different places through your life course, through your experience.And the trick goal is, is to be an active agent, make the most of each place and search for what's good and what you've been missing in that place in others.Michael: That's awesome, Luis. Thank you so much for taking the time.Luis: My pleasure.
4,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Jennifer, it is an honor and a pleasure to be here in your office discussing research that I find most interesting.Jennifer: Great to have you here.Michael: I'd like to anchor this in the human time scale, and then work our way out into bigger concerns. So, I guess the start is how did you become a scientist?Jennifer: Ah, yes. I love origin stories. This is a question I often ask scientists myself. So, how did I become a scientist? I was a good student in science and math in high school, like many scientists were. I thought they were incredibly boring because I didn't really understand what math and science were at that point. I thought it was about memorizing a bunch of facts and a bunch of algorithms and kind of regurgitating them or applying them on tests, and so when I went to college I decided I wanted to get away from science and math and so I studied philosophy. And I studied philosophy because I was really interested in the progression of ideas through time, and I thought I was going to get that through philosophy and also it had the fewest requirements of any major at my university, so it gave me the most freedom to do a lot of other things. And I was interested in reading and writing and close reading of texts, and that thing. So philosophy kind of let me down in certain kind of ways too. Too much of it was sort of taking classes in dead old white men. But it was my sophomore year in college that I took a class on history of science, or philosophy of science actually, with Hilary Putnam, a very eminent philosopher of science, and that's when a light bulb for me went off. And so I ended up actually doing more work in history and philosophy of science because that's where I really got turned onto the progression of ideas through time; that's sort of where I was getting it. I wasn't getting it so much in the way I wanted it through philosophy itself in a lot of ways, but through understanding the history of ideas of scientific ideas and the philosophy of scientific ideas that really turned me on.And so, by the time I finished college I was thinking to myself, "Well, maybe someday I'll go back and get a science degree, maybe I should check out this science thing for real." And I was out for a couple of years doing some environmental work and environmental activism until I was under stimulated and a little bored and I decided, well maybe now is the time for me to check out this science thing. And so, I dove back in, started doing a master's degree in ecology and systematic biology at San Francisco State University and then it kind of unfolded from there in a very still nonlinear fashion but that's a whole nother...that's the earliest part of the origin story.Michael: Okay, so the meat of the conversation today is about your work in ecology and in trophic network reconstruction, so let's get into that and how you came to pursue that particular scientific passion.Jennifer: Yeah, in terms of my interest in ecology, that sort of tied into just early childhood frankly, you know running around in the woods and catching tadpoles and raising them into frogs, and you know, budding little naturalist. I didn't express that until I kind of started decided to study ecology in my 20's. And I actually originally did my master's in PhD basically in plant ecology. I trained as what I call a conventional field experimental plant ecologist looking at the impacts of micro-climate and macro-climate on plant communities. Did my PhD research up at the Rocky Mount Biological Lab up near Crested Butte, Colorado. But towards the end of my PhD, I enjoyed it, I did original research, it was really exciting to become a scientist and to practice that.But focusing just on plants wasn't doing it for me. Again, I was like, "What is it that I need? What is it I want?" And what I really was interested in was I wanted someway to grab onto the full set of species in an ecosystem. I didn't want to just know about one subset of species, and a lot of ecology tends to focus in on a particular ecosystem or a particular type of taxon or a particular interaction and I got exposed to food web research and that got me really excited because that was really excited because that was really trying to look at the full diversity of systems but then to understand the full set of complex interactions that are tying all these different kinds of organisms from bacteria up to top predators together.And food web research, which in the 90s was kind of a small little disrespected backwater of ecological research at that time, but I saw the promise of it and also the promise of using networks and network theory and network approaches in general as a means for trying to quantify and dig into and understand the complexity of ecosystems in terms of how species interact. So it was at that point that I ended up switching from my PhD to postdoc, from being a plant ecologist to studying food webs and ecological networks, and taking these approaches from statistical physics and applying them to understanding the structure and the dynamics and the stability of ecosystems.Michael: Some of the really interesting...at least for me, some of the most interesting stuff that you've worked on in the last few years, to zoom out one layer, is in human history and to talk about an idea that has itself evolved over the history of human science and philosophy: our relationship to nature; do we belong in that category or out of it? And, your work on archaeoecological use web reconstruction so talk a little bit about that and where the different human communities and the different ecosystems in which you're doing this work. And also the way that this has brought you into affiliation with these indigenous communities and what that's like.Jennifer: Okay.Michael: Yeah.Jennifer: There's a lot there.Michael: There's quite a bit there.Jennifer: But I'll try to unpack that a bit. So most of my work, I mean what has been...you know, and this is another thing that ecologists do. So, ecologists tend to study, or pretend at least like they're studying ecosystems in the absence of humans or they may study ecosystems with human impacts, with humans as these external forcing factors and in fact my PhD research was about climate change impacts on plant communities. So, I was studying plant communities but trying to understand what climate change would be doing to them. So, in that case humans as this kind of negative external forcing factor. When I got into the food web research, I mostly at first was really doing work to try to understand the fundamentals. Does this food web from say a lake, is it structured similarly or differently from a food web in the ocean or from a food web in a forest or a food web in a desert.So a lot of my early work was really about are food webs similar or different from each other in how they're organized? What are the implications of that for the robustness of those ecosystems to species loss and species change? But it was very much in this tradition of not thinking like humans are somewhere out there separate from the ecosystems I'm comparing and studying. And in fact I and others have found that there are very deep commonalities in how ecosystems are structured. But about a decade ago or maybe a little longer ago I got cold called by someone who's involved in a proposal to The National Science Foundation to fund what they were calling biocomplexity research in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska.And so this was as group of environmental scientists, ecologists and archaeologists who were banding together to study this little piece of the Aleutian Islands, the Sanak Archipelago near the tip of the Alaskan Peninsula and to basically do an integrated study of the environment, the climate over time, of the ecology over time and of humans and how humans fit into and interact and impact those other elements so kind of looking at humans ecology environmental intertwined. So they contacted me because they had seen some of my food web work and said, "Huh, I wonder if we could...or if Jennifer, or Jennifer and her colleagues, could use those kinds of approaches as a means of thinking about the Aleut, the human hunter gatherers and how they kind of fit in to this ecological environmental system."So they pitch this idea to me and I said, "Wow, that sounds really cool. That sounds really interesting, sign me up." So I became a part of the proposal, the proposal got funded and so that was how I first got pulled into thinking about humans. And in this case, a very important thing that we all agreed on from the very beginning and that is reflected in papers that have come out is this notion that we need to do more work both as archaeologists and as ecologists to not have these strong separations and to not think of humans as outside of the ecosystem or as just some negative forcing factor. And so we want think...I mean humans, in one sense are just another species, and they act in certain ways and their behavior, like with other species impacts other organisms and impacts the ecosystem. And so we were all committed to sort of this notion of pulling humans explicitly into ecological analysis and using ecological analysis to encompass species including humans.So my colleagues compiled a huge amount of data and that's a whole nother story but Spencer Wood, who's still a very close colleague of mine, he's up at University of Washington, he as doing a PhD in intertidal ecology, food web ecology at the time, and he did this big effort to put together this huge database of species feeding interactions or trophic interactions — that's just another word for feeding. And then also did local sampling of the intertidal and the near shore marine systems and was able to combine all this ecological information that we would normally use to pull food webs together and figuring out who eats whom and whose present and all that stuff. We combine that with archaeological data of various kinds, so for example, there’s 128 home sites on this small island, all of them were... And all of this work actually was done with the explicit approval and permission of the Sanak corporation which is the group of Aleut, the Sanak Aleut who used to live on the island, they moved off in the 50s. And they were actually very excited to support the archeological and ecological research that goes on and I'll come back to that in a minuteBut, so the archaeologists excavated or took course from them middens by all the home sites, the middens are just the trash heaps, the human trash heaps, but they go down through time. So the deeper you go in the midden the deeper in time you are. And people have been on the island for 6000 years or longer. And out of that they were able to pluck out all these shells and bones and they can do zooarchaeology on them to figure out what fish species and what shell, you know, mollusks and birds and things they were feeding on. That's not a complete picture of what the Aleut were feeding on, so we were in that case, my colleagues were also able to include some anthropological data so they ethnographic studies and what they did was actually to go to the Sanak Aleut elders and actually who have lived on island and interviewed them and asked them like, "What did you eat?", you know? And "What did you eat in times of need? And what did you eat in times of plenty? And what were your preferences? And what was this? And what was that?"So that really helped to fill out like they ate a lot of different species of algae and they ate a lot of different invertebrates and there was just a lot of things that they ate in addition to the little bones and shelly bits that we could recover. So you start...we used all that information in order to bring humans, in this case the Sanak Aleut explicitly into the food web as one of the nodes and connect them to all the different species that they were consuming. And so then again it was not the first time that humans have been included in a food web but the previous food webs that had included humans were very much kind of cartoonish. They were very small and poorly resolved and they weren't really good data for really doing anything scientific with. This was the first time that a really highly resolved food web with many hundreds of species resolved evenly at all levels of the food web explicitly included humans.So, that then allowed us to start asking fairly simple questions, things like, “How do humans compare as predators or consumers to other consumers and the variety of things they eat?” You know, very simple question but unless you have the data you can't answer it. And so we knew first of all humans were feeding on about a quarter of the species in the marine system, in the near-shore marine system. And so is that a lot or is that a little? You don't know until you compare, so then we'd look at the other...we can do a histogram where we show basically how many of the predators or consumers in the system feed on x number of prey species. And so you get this distribution where most things are highly specialized and the feed on one to ten different things.But then you have this long tail and humans are way out at the end of it along with cod…Michael: And we're eating the cod, so, yeah.Jennifer: Right exactly. And cod probably would've eaten humans if they had a chance, but I don't think they had a chance. And so those two species were eating many more different types of species and other species in that system. And not only that, humans were highly omnivorous. They were feeding at all trophic levels. So feeding on everything from the algae to the shrimp to the mollusks to the fishes and to the sea mammals, sea lions and things. So yeah, so we can start to use this kind of data to really start to understand how humans compare to other species in the context of an ecological network. And this is the reason actually why the Sanak Aleut were really…or, part of the reason they were interested in supporting this kind work, is because it actually gave them information about themselves.I mean they obviously knew a lot of this already, they know what they eat and they even know what they eat historically; but to have it done in a very quantitative way and in a rigorous scientific way, it provides them with a lot of information that's actually quite useful to them as a people and as a culture. For example when things come up, I mean there can be law cases where they need to assert their rights to hunt and fish certain kinds of things and they need to demonstrate that they have a history of doing this. And so now this gives them some additional ways to actually kind of go, "Look, we have the charts and graphs to back us up." And it's also useful just for them in sort of maintaining ties through time of their current culture, which no longer lives on the island, to their past history as a people, and so it helps that continuity.Michael: So in the abstract to the 2015 paper that came out of this research, you mention that potential extinctions in the simulation that you ran on this data decreased when an “invading omnivorous supergeneralist consumer,” that would be us, focused strong feeding on decreasing fractions of its possible resources. So, that seems to have some pretty broad implications and I'd like to dig in on that a little bit and then possibly also link that to the work that you and Stefani Crabtree did in Australia looking at the impact of human foraging technology and approaches to that particular ecosystem and...Jennifer: Yeah, so I think there's often an assumption when people think about humans, and their impact on ecosystems that we always mess things up. We come into a system and things go extinct, and we mess up the environment, and we change the climate and just that we do bad things. And that, you know, certainly human, there's many examples of humans having negative impacts when they enter a system or if they are in a system for a long time and overdevelop or do too much agriculture or cause species to go extinct for whatever reason; but what we're finding with the food web research is we're actually, at least in historical and archaeological time, we're finding very interesting examples of humans coming into systems where humans hadn't existed and fitting into the system and sometimes being a very critical factor for stabilizing the biodiversity of the system.So we have kind of two examples of this on, the Aleut one that I was involved with and led and then this other one that you mentioned that Stefani Crabtree was involved with. So in the case of the Aleut project up in Alaska, what we realized from looking at the structure of the food web and how humans fit into it is that humans were special in the roles that they played, in a sense; I mean they were these supergeneralists feeding on many different things and superomnivores feeding at all trophic levels and very closely connected to all the other species in the food web and just the fact of that, how they fit in, that alone suggest that they were poised when they came in 6000 or 7000 years ago, to have big impacts on the system. They potentially could have had big negative impacts given that they feed on so many different things and at different levels.However, we have no evidence that there were any short or long term extinctions in that system, or severe environmental degradation, or other negative affects. They seems to kind of come in and fit in and this is in spite of the fact that they were these super generalist omnivores and in spite of the fact that they also used hunting technology, and they made kayaks, and they made all the tools that went along with kayaks, and their preferred food were sea lions and so they'd go out and hunt sea lions. But it was a big effort to try to get all that technology together, and also most of the time the weather didn't allow them to go out and hunt sea lions. So, what they would do and what they did was something that's very common to ecological generalists: they switched prey pretty much all the time. And so, if you can feed on many things, you may have a preference, in this case for the sea lions, but most of the time you can't go after that preferred thing for whatever reason; so you go, "Well, I'm going to go into the intertidal and I'm going to pick up sea urchins and eat sea urchins or big juicy mollusks, or whatever."And then even within the intertidal you'll switch because you'll go after the big juicy things first, and then those get a little harder to find and so they just kind of naturally switch to a smaller-bodied thing. And then when the salmon run would arrive the salmon would come in and they would drop everything else and they would go focus on the salmon. And then if the weather was really bad and the salmon weren't around they might just harvest some bird eggs close to their home. So, but this kind of switching among your different prey items is what generalists do, and it makes a lot of sense if you think about it, it's kind of intuitive that you would switch under certain circumstances. The other thing it does, is it's very stabilizing for the ecosystem because it allows things whose local populations are decreasing because you're eating them or for whatever other reason, it allows them to recover. Your attention goes somewhere because it's easier to find this other thing and so, the population you were focusing on for food gets to recover.So that's really good for the population, it's also good for the whole ecosystem and so what we did in that paper, in that piece of research was to run some toy models basically, some simulations of an idealized system that we invaded with a human-like species that's supergeneralist and omnivore. We also gave them kind of a stand in for using hunting technology. What hunting technology does for humans in effect is to allow them to feed at a rate that's much greater than their body size so typically predators you can sort of tag their success rate or their rate to hunt and acquire food, it's roughly a function of their body size, as many things are in biology. But if you start developing technology and using it, all of a sudden it's like you're a whole pack of people all smooshed together who can access many more calories all at once.Michael: It's like that image of the big fish eating the smaller fish and then the entire school of fish…Jennifer: Right, eating the big fish.Michael: ...that's shaped like a giant fish, yeah.Jennifer: And I mean and so, yeah, and group hunting behavior is a form of kind of feeding successfully at a higher rate than an individual be able to. So hunting tech does this for you. So, yes if human hunter-gathers had come into that system with a bunch of fancy hunting tech, and they had used hunting tech all the time on everything, that probably would have been really disruptive and caused some extinctions locally. However, most of the time the Sanak Aleut, they hunted some of the time, and they liked to go out and hunt, like I said sea lions, but a lot of the times they were just foraging, they weren't using technology or maybe they might have some kind of pail or bucket to put things in from the intertidal, but a lot of times they're just going out and foraging for stuff and not using fancy tech, so they're basically kind of tied to their body size.And so, as long as...I mean you could have the humans come into that system and give them a little bit of hunting technology, but as long as you limited it to a few things at a time, which is pretty much what the humans did in this system, then you basically don't see secondary extinctions. Now it's not the only reason you wouldn't see secondary extinctions in that system, because the human population was relatively small and also their kind of in an open system, so marine organisms are kind of flowing into the system from the outside and replenishing themselves also. But there certainly are scenarios where people have arrived on islands and wreaked havoc, they did not so that on the Sanak Island, and we think it's partly because they were prey switching and allowing things to recover, and they were only using hunting technology a fraction of the time.So, that's the Aleut story. So the other story is this Australia story that Stefani Crabtree was involved with and did work building on a lot of work by Rebecca Bliege Bird, a professor at Penn State. And so Stephanie, she basically brought this food web kind of perspective to work that had been going on, looking at the Martu people, the hunter-gatherers of the western desert of Australia. Now this is a very different kind of system from what I'd looked at, at the Sanak islands, it's a terrestrial continental system basically, it's a desert system. Whereas the Sanak Aleut had been on their island for about seven thousand years, six or seven thousand years, the aborigines of Australia have been on their landscape for probably 80,000 years, maybe longer and in effect there is no ecosystem on Australia that is separate or prior to humans. Humans and the Australian ecosystems have co-evolved over many tens of thousands of years. So they put together, Stefani put together food web data for the Martu because what happened with the Martu is that the government of Australia, in their infinite wisdom, pulled the Martu people off of their lands, off the western desert of Australia in the mid 20th century, so just removed them from their ancestral lands. And so Stefani was able to put together kind of before and after pictures of the food webs including the humans, so with humans and then without humans. And, the impact within just a few years, frankly, was enormous.When they pulled the Martu people off a bunch of small bodied mammals went extinct, there was a bunch of extinction cascades, the food web contracted greatly, it became much smaller and impoverished because what had happened basically is that the Martu people do small scale burning in order to access their main preferred food items, and their preferred food items are large bodied lizards. And so they would do this patchy burning on the landscape that would make it easier for them to hunt lizards and get them out of their holes in the ground. And so, they created...and over many tens of thousands of years they've been doing this and so they've created this beautiful mosaic of landscapes, of these sub landscapes on the desert that did several things; A, it created adversity of ecosystems, so it enhanced the bio diversity of the whole region because you have all these different patches at different levels of growth and development and so different kind of species can thrive in these. It also prevented massive wild fires because it was this kind of controlled burn thing that humans were doing but over many tens of thousands of years.So when they pulled the humans out, all of a sudden they started also getting massive wildfires that would just burn everything to the ground and sterilize the soil for the top several inches and impede redevelopment of the ecosystem and reduce diversity. So Stefani was able to show the aspects of this through looking at these before and after snapshots of the food webs and what's happening now is that the Martu people are now moving back onto their ancestral lands in the western desert and are returning to their old practices, including this patchy burning of the landscape, and already the ecosystem is starting to rebound in terms of diversity and other impacts.So those are two really cool examples where food web approaches were used to explicitly incorporate humans into ecological network studies, and for ecology to kind of encompass humans, in this case hunter-gatherers. And in both cases humans were important for the functioning of the ecosystem, even more so that's even more stark in the Australian case. But in both cases…I mean in the case of the Sanak Aleut, they came in 7,000 years ago or so and didn't wreak destruction and havoc and it's too early to tell now that humans have moved off those systems, how much of an impact that's going to have. In the case of the Martu people in Australia, there's very clearly a very negative ecological impact by pulling humans out of the system and an ecological benefit to having them come back onto the system.Michael: This is definitely...you know the way I've seen this portrayed in the news is, like you said at the beginning of this, a way to disabuse ourselves of this kind of self-destructive eco-guilt that humans are just ruinous wherever we appear.Jennifer: Right and we're separate from nature and we're ruinous to nature, it's like, well we're a part of nature for better and for worse, as many other species are too.Michael: Yeah I think we have in part films like The Matrix, you know Agent Smith, calling humans a virus…Jennifer: A cancer, right. Yeah.Michael: ...and that just seeded our imagination, yeah. So, I'm interested in, not just among hunter-gatherer communities, but I've heard seemingly related research into the areas around cities and how the built environment of human beings can actually provide zones of extraordinary biodiversity. And so like, we haven't even brought up the ArchaeoEcology Project…Jennifer: Yeah, and we'll get there.Michael: Yeah, which encompasses…Jennifer: Much more than feeding, right?Michael: Yes, the entire use web of all this stuff. Two of the questions raised by this project are, “How does space and dimension of territory influence the socio-ecological systems?” And then also, “A key role of humans may be bringing together other taxa that would not otherwise interact so, how variable is this integration? And how does this affect resource management and ecological stability?” So, there seems like a really important vital move toward understanding human settlements as areas where we can actually perform regenerative functions and that human created niches can lead to novel interactions; and I'd love to hear what kind of insights are actually being applied out of this? If you...I mean like.Jennifer: I don't know.Michael: Yeah.Jennifer: I won't be able answer that.Michael: Okay.Jennifer: But I'll talk about sort of tangential related things. But I mean a couple of things, so in terms of...I mean I just mentioned two projects that are looking at humans in food webs and in these cases, cases where humans were a part of food webs, an important part of stabilizing food webs and so not ruinous to the webs. There's also, there is a socio of...I mean there are movements afoot, and The National Science Foundation has funded something so NSF and the United States have funded these things called long-term ecological research sites, so where they're actually supporting long term research over decades because too often research is kind of bounded by the length of a grant which is like three to five years. And so NSF invested in long-term ecological research, well as a part of that they actually funded a couple of urban rural gradient research sites, so basically they supported groups who were doing research in rural to urban gradients basically.So where they go all the way from kind of a rural, more natural setting across space into the city and then they look at different aspects of ecological and human kind of involvement and environment along that gradient or along that transect and I think... and so, one of those was centered around Baltimore and one of those centered around Tempe/Phoenix, and I hopefully got that right. So, mean I think there's a lot of interesting work that people are starting to do along those lines. Now in terms of sort of the bigger agenda that we're looking at, me and my colleagues Stefani Crabtree and Spencer Wood and a variety of archqeologists and anthropologist shave gotten together and this kind of grew out...first off, all of it grew out of this humans and food webs work. It also grew out of conversation I had via a project I got involved with based in French Polynesia, so the islands of Moorea and some sister islands; so that's next to Tahiti.So, I got involved in a similar kind of project in some ways in Moorea with some archaeologists, Pat Kirch and Jenny Khan, and we realized early on in the project a few years ago that we didn't really have the resources to compile a really complete full food web of all the species on multiple islands; we want to do that eventually. So we were kind of tossing around the idea of what could we do that we think is interesting and important that's shy of kind of doing this full food web thing that I did up in the Sanak Aleut project and so what we started around is like, well we have a lot of information on not just how humans were feeding on other species but how they were interacting with species in other ways and using them often in a variety of different ways.And so, I brought this idea back to my colleagues, Stefani and Spencer and we started kind of brainstorming more deeply about this and this is sort of how the ArchaeoEcology Project was born and so what we decided to put together a working group to basically...it's not just about food, I mean food is important right? It's fundamental, everything has to eat one way or another. But in the case of humans, humans are also really good at using species in other kinds of ways and so we put together this working group to kind of hash out what are these primary ways? In terms of kind pre-industrial people. And in clothing, humans use other species for clothing and they use other species for shelter and they use them for fuel and they use them to make tools and they use them for transportation and they use them as pets and they use them a medicine and they use them for ritual purposes and they use them for cosmological purposes.And so, we basically, what we realized, we had this whole potential rich new area that we had complied data in across many different kinds of systems and systematically gather data about all the different kinds of ways that in this case preindustrial humans were interacting with other species because as we start to compile that data, that opens up this whole world of interesting kind of questions that we can start asking including some of the ones that you've found in some of our materials. And it also, the way that I think about it is like so, you know, humans are interacting with species in these huge variety of ways; we can put numbers on those, we can create networks of those and we can use that to understand basically how humans are interacting with biodiversity and how are the patterns similar or different across systems all over the world and in different parts of time. And how does that relate to the ecological context?So, what are the species as humans enter these systems, what are the species they have access to? What are the habits they have access to? What are the constraints and opportunities of the environment, of the climate? All the places have different kinds of climates, some are dry, some are wet, some are continental, some are marine. You know, and also, humans bring their own culture and their own stuff with them; their own taboos and their own tools and technology. I mean like when the ancient Polynesians, they came across and came into the Polynesian Islands. The Polynesian Islands in New Zealand where the last parts of the world to be occupied by humans and that happened 700 to 1,000 years ago.And, they came across from Southeast Asia and they came across open water, thousands of miles of open ocean water in canoes that they brought whole little ecosystems with them because they were agriculturalist so they brought a bunch of agricultural plants like bananas and taro and coconuts. They brought pigs and they brought chickens and they brought hitch hikers, rats and other things. And so they bring all these things into the ecosystem and it's like, how does the ecosystem respond to that? They've got these crazy new species coming in, humans plus all these associated species. You know, humans started alternating the ecosystem, they had cut down trees in order to create agricultural land but then they started taking advantage of what's there too; they become fisher people or continue to be fisher people and take advantage of the reef system. So basically this a new thing, no one's tried to compile this kind of data systematically before there.There's a ton of information out there about uses of different species but it's usually very piecemeal. Like in the Pacific Northwest, there's whole monographs and careers have been on like a thousand and one uses for red cedar. So what we got was a group of archaeologists and anthropologists to basically commit to compiling the same kinds of data for their systems so that we could then go back and start comparing them and being like, "Well, does the Pacific Northwest coast people...what's common and what's different with how they interact with species versus what goes on with the Martu people of Australia?" And there's a zillion different interesting questions you can start to ask with data like that if you can compile that data — which we think we can, we're getting there.One thing that I'm interested in that's a kind of perennial topic of discussion at the Santa Fe Institute is innovation: technology use, technology development and innovation across cultures. And I mean the way that, that's been looked at by archaeologists for example and past systems has often been to look at pot sherds or you know, but they've been very limited in kind of the way...or for modern systems we look at the patents, you can look at patents and sort of unpack and look at patterns in patents. But what we're doing now for these preindustrial systems at latest is we're providing a way to start to understand the complexities of technology use and technology's use by different people, and this goes back to sort of different examples of hunting and gathering.So, certain kinds of interactions with species are very simple, you know, if you want to eat a berry you wait until it ripens, you go out into the forest, you find a berry and you eat it. Or if you want to eat a mussel you got out to the intertidal, you crack a mussel on a rock and you slurp its insides out. But if you want to go hunt a whale, which the Pacific Northwest people do, all of a sudden you have to do this crazily complex set of interactions with a variety of species in order to create the technology that you need in order to hunt whale. So you have to cut a tree down to make a canoe, you to have use all kinds of tools that are made out of other species in order to make the canoe, you have to make all these associated technologies, a sphere and floats and other things and you have to do rituals of a certain kind that require interaction with a different set of species.I mean just making a cane alone requires humans using about a dozen different plant species and about a dozen different animal species in a variety of different ways. So it's its own complex little network just to create the canoe itself and that's just one piece of the puzzle, for the technology to go out and successfully hunt and eat a whale. So the data as we start to dive into it and get into some of the complexities of how we sort of understand the variety of different ways humans are interacting with species all of a sudden like you get this really rich network data that allows you to start to kind of make comparisons. Is there a trade off? For example, the Martu people have a really rich cosmology, is that partly because they’re fairly resource poor in other ways and so they have a richer cosmology.Although that may not be true because the Pacific Northwest people both have a rich cosmology but they also have access to many more different types of species. So there's lots of hypothesis that people have put out there about different things, but this is going to give us new ways to kind of get at some of those comparisons and questions but using this new kind of quantitative data.Michael: It's really interesting in light of this, you know, Brian Arthur type question about the evolution of technology and the idea that technology as an evolutionary system is path-dependent so, like the question about, what happens if we have a civilizational collapse and then we have to reboot with all the metals…Jennifer: You lose the knowledge, yeah.Michael: ...mined out already and all of the oils and natural gases mined out already, so can we actually rebuild the civilization that we have from a different starting place?Jennifer: Right, and actually that's in a smaller sense, that's sort of one of the things we'll be asking of our different systems. What kinds of technologies do people develop given particular kinds of opportunities they had or lack of opportunities they had? And in some cases we're looking at people who brought technologies with them from other places. In other cases, we're just looking at people who basically co-evolved with the ecosystem over many tens of thousands of years and just developed their own approaches and technologies. So I think we can start to kind of play some of these games in a sense but not games, you know, it's like this is what humans actually did on a variety of different landscapes.But by looking at it through the lens of biodiversity and our interactions with different species, it gives us a hook an ecological hook into trying to quantify and understand some of those things. And it just gives us a new lens and a new kind of framework for trying to answer some of these interesting questions or old questions in new ways, and ask new kinds of questions, so.
5,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: So there is something really deep in general and profound here that I want to put a pin in and circle back around to because historian William Irwin Thompson who, associated with various SFI professors over the years through the Lindisfarne Association, was the one who introduced me to the idea that we destroy forest in order to create libraries, and that Amazon.com is in someway like a transubstantiation of the Amazon, you know, and so I'm even looking up in your office at this article on the dwindling web, and this question of, “Can we actually reconstruct this to show that a technological ecosystem is literally replacing biological trophic networks?”Let's put a pin in that. In order to get into that depth, it's important to go into your more paleontological work and the conservation of the structure of these trophic networks over millions of years. Your research suggest that something really consistent and universal, like a thermodynamics kind of level is going on here, so, I'd love to hear you talk about the work that you did with the Smithsonian on the reconstruction of the Burgess Shale. There's a great line from the piece that you and Justin Yeakel wrote for American Scientist, saying, "Reconstructing the feeding interactions with the Burgess shale is no easy task, particularly with species with whose strange morphologies inspire names such as Anomalocaris and Hallucigenia." I mean, these are bizarre organisms how on earth did you actually put together a trophic network that you were confident enough about to actually draw these associations.Jennifer: Right. Yeah, so that's really fun, fabulous work also, and I obviously over the last 10 or 15 years in my career, I've become obviously fascinated with deep time, both on human timescales and on geologic timescales and so there's actually a really good Santa Fe Institute story behind the Burgess shale work and the first paleo food we work that I was involved with. And I was at SFI as a young post doc in the early 2000s and I gave a talk on my early food web work, and some person I didn't know sat down next to me at lunch, he had been at my talk and without much preamble he said, "So do you think that we can do this for really ancient ecosystems?" and I said, "How old?" and he said, "You know, 500 million years, give or take." And I laughed and that was the start of the paleobiology food web work.That person was Doug Erwin, who is a very well known paleobiologist at the Smithsonian, he's also the curator of the Burgess shale collection at the Smithsonian. And so, he and I basically just kind of brainstormed about could we do this kind of stuff for really old systems and how would we do that? What would it look like? The very questions you asked. So we brought together a group of paleobiologists we thought might be friendly to this idea and might potentially have the right kinds of data and some food web and had an ongoing working group. And one of the things we did as a group and this is sort of similar to what the first thing my humans in food web or humans in ecological networks group did. The humans in food webs or humans in ecological networks people had to figure out what are the main categories of use and interaction with other species?What the paleo people had to figure out was what are the different line of inference that can be used to hypothesize a feeding link between taxa that are half a billion years old or older? Or you know are less for some of the data sets we were looking at. And like how do you know that are Anomalocaris is feeding on trilobites? You know, you can't watch it, can't see, can't observe it, can't do a feeding trial, it can't extract gut contents.Michael: It's unscientific to just assume from the palps on that thing that it’s…Jennifer: Well no, so that's not unscientific, that’s a piece of the science. So I like to joke that I locked all the paleobiologists into our medium conference room and I told them they wouldn't get any green chile or margaritas until they came up with a set of inferences so they did, we did. So basically there's a lot known about the morphology and even the philogyny that kind of evolutionary history or organisms and fossil assemblages. And in the case of certain fossil assemblages like the Burgess shale, they're called Lagerstätten, so they are very well preserved fossil assemblages' they're very unusual. So these are not normal but it's like a sudden event like the whole ecosystem got smothered or it all died all at once for different kinds of reasons.Michael: Yeah, the Solnhofen limestone, Liaoning in China, like that kind of stuff.Jennifer: Yeah, so and just some kind of event or confluence of events means that all of the species including the soft bodied bits get preserved very faithfully in the fossil record altogether. Most of the time you only get the hard shelly boney bits that get preserved but that's only a piece of the ecosystem but in the case of the Burgess Shale and some of the Cambrian shales and other throughout time, there have been this exquisite preservation from primary producers all the way up to predators and parasites and things. So you know species, you know what all the possible pairs are, you know, how do you decided who's actually eating whom. So, every feeding link is a hypothesis. In the fossil record every link is a hypothesis because you don't know it for sure, for sure, for sure, so it's a hypothesis but it's annotated with one or more lines of inference.The best line of inference actually is gut contents. So there actually are fossilized gut contents, and the experts know how to distinguish gut contents from things that just died on top of each other, that actually can be distinguished.Michael: Or pregnancy, which is another thing.Jennifer: Right, yeah. But finding fossilized gut contents is not very frequent. And you occasionally, actually get things fossilized in the moment of feeding, like where a big fish had its mouth around a little fish and there's examples of that, yeah not very common, it's the smoking gun, but there's many other lines of evidence. So, the functional morphology of the organism tells you a lot about what it can and can't eat so that's where you get to the palps, or what are the teeth like? The teeth will tell you something about the kinds of things it could and could not eat. There's also bite marks, so a lot of things end up with bite marks that get preserved when they die.Jennifer: So for example, one of the reasons AnomaloCARis, or AnomALAcaris, I never could get a paleobiologist to commit to one of those two pronunciations…Michael: Well it's etymologically it's “CARis” right, but then you have like Archaeopteryx with the "P" pronounced or whatever, yeah.Jennifer: Yeah, so yeah. Anomalocaris, Anomalocaris, anyway, they feed on trilobites in our food web, a big part of why we hypothesized...that's the royal we, hypothesized that they feed on trilobites because many trilobites have been found with tooth marks that match the Anomalocaris mouth parts and teeth.Michael: So that's a pretty confident hypothesis?Jennifer: Yeah. So many things are fairly confident so, but you may have... I mean and then there's the body size tells you something about what you can or can't eat or what can and cannot eat you, so there's like 10 or 12 of these kind of different...and we number them one through 12 or whatever. And then, so every link has one or more lines of evidence, you know, it's like, mouth part, body size, gut content assigned to it. And then what we do is we assign a certainty level to every link. How certain are we that this link actually happened? And we do that...and we have a very simple way of doing that. Certain things are high certainty and then of themselves, gut contents are high certainty.But then if something only has one line of evidence, then we say that's low certainty. If it has two or more lines of evidence, or no, two lines of evidence then its medium certainty and then if three or more, gut contents, then it's high certainty. And that's important to do, I mean you have to some way of dealing with uncertainty and this is certainly not the only way you can deal with uncertainty in the fossil record and constructing a food web. There's other people who do it in a different kind of way using kind or more probabilistic statistics. They actually tend to work with more impoverished kinds of data than what we were working with, so.In any case, out of this eventually pops a food web, or multiple food webs because we looked at a couple of systems, and then where every link is a hypothesis with one or more lines of inference and a certainty level assigned to it then we can start to do the questions of like, okay, the simplest question is, is this organized differently or similarly to modern food webs. And the role of this certainty assignment allows us to do a sensitivity analysis. So we can look at the structure of that food web with all of the links included but then we can systematically knock out links, we can knock out low certainty links, we can knock out random links and we can see how much does that change if at all our understanding of the structure? I mean eventually it will but you can actually monkey with it quite a bit before you change your final conclusion but it gives us a way to deal with the uncertainty which is really important when you're working with that kind of data.And what we found basically, long story short is that these Cambrian food webs, the Burgess Shale and the Chengjiang Shale food webs are structured fundamentally similarly to modern food webs regardless of the habitat. So modern food webs regardless of habitat are structure similarly, and these more than a half a billion year old food webs are also structured similarly and it's nonrandom structure. And so that suggest that...you and again you mentioned this at the beginning, that's in spite of the fact that many of the species in the Cambrian or in the Burgess shale, they don't have any modern descendants, they had really crazy body plans that don't exist anymore and they're all like these marine creatures and so a lot of them kind of were evolutionary dead ends, I mean that's not a great term but it just, you know, everything eventually becomes an evolutionary dead end.But yeah, but often they're just body plans that were never seen again so they couldn't be more different in terms of multicellular organisms to modern creatures but yet they're still coming together in food webs in fundamentally similar kinds of ways. I mean that suggest to me that it's not...food web structure's not something that evolved, it didn't evolve over time from the Cambrian to now, there's other things that are constraining it to be like that and we don't really know that yet, that's still an open question; like I'm sure it has something to do with thermodynamic constraints of how you distribute resources in a complex network, it could have something to do with either way the different kinds of necessary nutrients and chemicals balance across a whole system, I mean it could have something to do with many things and that's an open frontier of research frankly.Michael: So you're not as confident as I am here in my arm chair to speculate that this has strong implications for astrobiological research, for example, that we're not necessarily going to observe the same kind of trophic networks in a methane-based ecosystem?Jennifer: Oh I actually think we probably would.Michael: Yeah?Jennifer: Perhaps. I mean because I don't think it's about evolving a structure because I think it's about other kinds of constraints, it depends on the nature of those constraints, I mean I've often wanted to be able to construct really detailed food webs for like chemoautotrophic-based food, I haven't got that data, or I don't have access to it yet, maybe someone out there is putting that together.Michael: You're working on hydrothermal vents and you're listening to this conversation! Who are you? Email us.Jennifer: So, yeah, so I mean, you know my base hypothesis at this point because of the work I've done will always be that I expect the structure to be similar and if it deviates from that then there's going to be some interesting kind of things to unpack, to understand and explain what the differences are, so.Michael: Well, so let's talk a little bit about this structure that's conserved.Jennifer: Mmmhmm.Michael: You mentioned again that there is a fixedness in the pattern of species interactions independent of species identity, habitat and time. You mentioned also in a piece that you wrote for the Layman et al. 2015 article that food webs, they've very similar to small-world networks, meaning short path links between all of the different nodes, but that they'll not scale-free.Jennifer: No, I mean some of the features that we tend to see, or that we see in food webs, I already mentioned one actually in talking about humans, but that was long time ago. So you think of a food web as all the species that co-occur in a particular habitat, so over some kind of space in time you kind of integrate across that. You know if species never see each other, you know then they aren't really a part of the same food web, they don't have the opportunity to feed on each other. In any case, within the food webs that we've looked at from across time in space and habitat and everything else, one very strong pattern is that most things are fairly specialized in what they feed on, so they feed on a fairly small fraction of the species that are available to them in the food web.But then you have this fairly long tail of the distribution where a few things are very highly generalized in what they feed on. And so, in the systems we've looked at so far for example, humans have always been highly generalized. You know, I don't think that'll necessarily always be the case for humans but so far that's what we've seen; and that pattern is not a scale-free pattern, it's not a power law, that you know power laws kind of exploded in popularity but were kind of over applied to everything for a long time, and the world's more interested and complicated than that. But in the case of food webs, they tend to...in most cases they tend to be more of an exponential distribution so it's a skewed distribution still, instead of like the data following a line on the log, log plot like they would if it was a power law, they follow a line on a log linear plot. So skewed but not as highly skewed as a power law.So, many, many specialists, a few generalists, and in an exponential kind of way. There are some food webs that skew more toward a uniform distribution and there's some that skew more towards a power law distribution but, you can do a scale collapse where you show data from a bunch of different food webs collapsing onto a universal curve, that's a nice little trick from statistical physics that's very handy for trying to find generalities or universalities across different kinds of data sets. But there's actually some more commonalities beyond that type of exponential type of distribution. They're a little hard to describe in simple language but I mean...you know short version is, there are some very simple models of network structure and in particular food web structure that basically they assumed that exponential type distribution but then they place some other constraints on how the nodes, how the species are linked together. And one of those, the niche model for food webs actually does a really good job of describing kind of various kinds of properties of empirical food webs.And, we use that model actually as a way to compare across food webs, because you have to take into account network structure changes systematically with the size of the network and also with how many links are in the network. And this is actually a really, really important point because you'll see or hear too often someone comparing a small food web and its properties, like how many omnivores are there? Or how many top predators are there, or what's the average trophic level, and then they'll compare this small food web to this much bigger more detailed food web. And they'll go "Look, see they have different average trophic levels. Or they have different percentages of omnivores, so they're different.” But actually the big one is just the big version of the small one once you scale up, that's actually you would expect it to have a greater percentage of omnivores or a higher main trophic level.So, this using kind of null models or models like the niche model, which is a little bit more than a null model, that allows us to understand how food webs of different sizes, how they compare to each other, and do it in a more rigorous way. And this is something that I had a lot of conversations about with my network theory and statistical physics colleagues when I first came to SFI, and who continue to acknowledge that this is indeed a very hard problem. How you rigorously and systematically compare the structure of different-sized networks and it's something that I grapple with all the time in food web research, so.Michael: One of the things that comes up in this comparative analysis of trophic networks is that food webs with lower connectivity may be more sensitive to species extinctions. And you've published numerous papers on looking at networks as they are thinned out before a mass extinction, thinning the network and making it sort of more vulnerable to perturbances.Jennifer: Right, yeah. Yeah, so some of my work and some of my very earliest work and my most well cited work is actually about using food webs to look at the robustness of ecological networks or ecosystems to species loss, but doing it from the lens of species in an ecosystem are interconnected through their interactions, feeding interaction being a very important one. And as you lose species, you're losing all the links to them also and all the links from them to other species, so it's not just them, their embedded with a set of feeding interactions and those feeding interactions are embedded within a broader network of feeding interactions. So, what I've done and colleagues of mine have done and I mean a fairly simple thing but it's just to do little simulations because you can't really do it in the real world. You can do it in really small microcosms but you can't go out into the real world and just pull a species of out it and make it go extinct.Michael: Well, maybe researchers in a hundred years will be able to look at our middens and…Jennifer: Well yeah, you can kind of look back and try to recreate the extinction sequence and people are starting to do some of that. But yeah, you can start plucking species out, you can do it different ways, you can do them randomly, you can pick the very highly-connected species, the hubs, you can pick low-connected species. But you start thinning the food web out and you're basically asking a question, you'll get a secondary extinction just looking at network structure if something loses all of its potential prey items; and so that's when you get a secondary extinction. And then if something depends on that then if that goes extinct then you can get a cascading extinction.And one of the things we found is, and this is no big surprise now, but a densely connected network is going to be more robust. I mean it's got more redundancy, it's got more pathways, so things seem to have more than one option or more than two options; and so it takes a while before you knock out all of the prey of any particular species. But as you thin and thin webs of species and the links attached to them, they come less and less robust to further disruption. In the simulations we did using really data sets you could actually knock out about 20% of the species before you got significant secondary extinctions but then once you start getting secondary extinctions it proceeds very rapidly, you start getting cascading extinctions.So you go from like, you can lose species, lose species, lose species, and then all of a sudden you really start getting these cascades. And I was involved in a study of the Adriatic Sea and different kinds of ecological indicators through time for the Adriatic Sea region, so this was a human-impacts-on-ecosystem kind of paper that I did not...I was a minor co-author on but there was a food web and robustness part of it. So they looked at Adriatic Sea food web across tens of thousands of years of human habitation and basically it's not until the last 200 years that you really see relative abundance of many species going way down and other kind of environmental indicators becoming worse.And, they also put together simple food webs and showed a big change from...like you don't see the food web fundamentally changing much until 200 years ago. And then it gets reduced quite a bit and you can do...another thing you can do with robustness studies is you can take one food web and like in the earlier state of the Adriatic Sea and show this is how robust it is to sequential extinctions. And then you can do that same thing for the reduced web of the present day and you can show there's huge reduction in robustness, in potential robustness of the two systems.And Justin Yeakel's work in the Egyptian system also kind of looked at this contraction of a food web or in his case a piece of a food web. So the medium- and large-bodied mammals, the carnivores and herbivores of ancient Egypt over the last 13,000 years since the late Pleistocene. And there you have a huge contraction of that piece of the food web just like in the Adriatic Sea, you'll have a significant contraction of the whole food web. Yeah.Michael: I just want to suggest that you go into a little bit about the methodology of that one. Because that's super fascinating.Jennifer: Yes, it is really cool and I'll get to that in a second. But I mean, the kind of punch line and then I'll go back to the Egyptian study, because it is super cool, is that they did a different kind of analysis on their contracting food webs through time, they did what's called a stability analysis. So we did this robustness analysis on our contracting food web. They did, a stability analysis on their contracting food web. We both came up with the same answer lately which is like, as you contract these food webs and you impoverish them, they become less and less stable and resilient and robust to further change. Not a huge surprise, but important to show.So, the Egyptian study, I wish I had been involved in that study but Justin Yeakel, former SFI postdoc who is now a professor at UC Merced, and he and I wrote a less technical kind of review of old food web research.Michael: Can we link to that in the show notes?Jennifer: Yeah, absolutely, that's a good thing for people to take a look at, it's a nice review. It's already kind of out of date and you know things are moving so quickly, but everything that's in it is accurate up until a couple of years ago. Anyway, Justin led this study of a piece of a food web of ancient Egypt. So, I mean, he looked at Egypt through the ages since the late Pleistocene, through kind of the classic ancient Egypt time of the pyramids and everything else, up until the present day. And so, what they did which is really hard to do across that 13,000 year period and I forget how many time slices but quite a few; they were able to reconstruct this piece of the food web with high fidelity, so the mammal predators and the mammal herbivores that they fed on.And, so at the end of the late Pleistocene before humans were on the scene but they were kind of low level hunter gatherers, they weren't having huge impact yet or developing everything; I think there were like 38 species in that little teeny piece of a food web. And you see the snapshots through time and it contracts and contracts and contracts until you only have eight species left in today's food web, I mean just a massive contraction. But, how did they create these snapshots of the food web? Well, over the course of ancient Egypt, there's a ton of art, a lot of it funerary art but a variety of different...not just funerary art but a lot of it was, some of it was makeup palettes and other things.They just did a lot of artwork and they depicted a lot of the animals that were present during that whatever particular period of time was on the artwork. So there's this Heirakonpolis palette, which depicts a bunch of these mammals, both predators and prey. It also has some fantastic animals that aren't actual real animals.Michael: The snake neck jaguar, that kind of thing?Jennifer: Right, yeah. So, you don't include those in the food web but most of the animals we know existed from other records also. And so, they were able to pull all of this interesting archaeological data off of this artwork at different points in time and basically what you're seeing is fewer and fewer species represented in the artwork over thousand of years because a lot of them just went extinct for various reasons, you know, climate change is happening. There was a wet period for several thousand years after the late Pleistocene and it went into a very dry period and there were three desertification events and you can actually see the predator prey ratios through time for these little food webs change significantly in idiosyncratic ways at the points at which you get super droughts.You have preferential extinctions of the herbivores over time, you can see this in the change in the predator-prey ratio over time and then they also, like I said, they did the stability analysis for the food webs in each of the different time slices showing that they were becoming less and less stable through time and now you've ended up with the incredibly impoverished food web that's really at risk for even further reduction.Michael: Yeah, you know, listening to this, you mentioned earlier that there's this possibility of a negative correlation in the richness of cosmology and the richness of the ecology and again, I wonder...I've read somewhere someone making the argument that as we lose species of living organisms, that there's an extended notion of the species, the way that we might think of a species of mineral, and that the Anthropocene is defined by an unprecedented proliferation in the kinds of things on our planet. You know in the number of new mineral species, the number of new configurations of matter; that we're going through what in one sense is a sixth mass extinction and in another sense would appear to be an enormous evolutionary radiation, but one that requires us to expand our definition of what qualifies in that picture, right.So, if we can just look at this somewhat less cynically than we are used to, the question opens up into the applicability of these trophic network models to a study to evoke W. Brian Arthur in this, and Kevin Kelly and other people that have writing meaningful interesting works about technology as a form of life…do you think that we can use these trophic network models do predict economic and technological niches? And do you think that we may be able to use this to guide...I mean, I hate thinking about, like robot pollinator bees, like that’s just such a horrible scenario to contemplate.Jennifer: Techno bees.Michael: Yeah. But do you think that we are sort of being driven into a thermodynamic outcome here? And that we can use this in a predictive way, not just to look back and understand this deep generality but to look forward and actually anticipate and move into positions that we can then use to proactively keep these networks in place and allow them to continue to proliferate?Jennifer: Right. [Laughs.]Michael: I mean, what a mess. Feel free to jump off into the speculation here.Jennifer: No, as a good scientist I don't love speculating in really giant ways so, I like to stay closer to home. I mean some of the things that we want to do with the ArchaeoEcology Project and thinking about human use networks, and this is a very early stage project but we are doing it with the notion of thinking about sustainability of socioecological environmental systems in mind. And whenever I talk about this stuff I usually get asked can we do this for modern systems? Would it be useful? What would it tell us? And yeah, ultimately...certainty I would like to pull it up into thinking about...using it as a different lens or a different framework for thinking about how humans interact with their ecosystems and environments in the modern world and using it to think...I mean you know even like the ideas of food deserts or people who have access to really a rich diversity of foods and the impoverishment of biodiversity by agriculture, because they only pick one particular species, one type of potato and there's like a hundred of them in Peru, which I got to see, which is really cool.I mean in terms of also thinking about the relationship between technology and innovation and resources of different kinds, I mean I'm coming at it through this biodiversity ecosystem lens. That's not to say you couldn't apply it to non-biotic resources and we've talked a little bit about how to incorporate non-biotic resources into how we characterize these networks. We're trying to get this right for simple systems first. I mean I think in terms of like, one of the things that we can ask of the prior systems and then use to think about some of the questions you brought up for current and future systems is like, what is the possible landscape of ways that people could create technologies or interact with other species given the kind of opportunities they had in any given system? And what made them explore or exploit a large part of that landscape versus only exploit or explore a small piece of it?And if they're only exploiting or a exploring fairly small piece of it, why? And what would it mean to look beyond that? And so, yeah, I think there could be some kernels in the kind of thing that we're doing if you try to think of the whole space of ways to put together different resources to create new technologies. Of course, you know, this is...you know, I'm not a huge techno-optimist, I mean humans are very good at creating technologies; we’re very bad understanding the outcomes and the negative repercussions of our technologies, we've proven that time and time again and I think we'll continue proving that. But I think that's also where our network perspective can be very handy, it's like, okay as you develop this technology let’s try to really embed with within the socioecological, environmental network and try to understand what the ramifications are.Humans are all too good at thinking like, "Oh, I'm going to make this better for humans by introducing this thing." And, I mean you know, we have a long history or introducing species both intentionally and unintentionally, our initial introductions often go badly awry; cane toads and…Michael: Beavers.Jennifer: I mean, yeah. I mean beavers are great ecosystem engineers, I mean…Michael: They've completely transformed parts of South America, but it’s bizarre.Jennifer: Yeah, absolutely, but they also have their indigenous habitat where they enhance hugely the biodiversity of many montane systems. You know, but yeah, introducing like fur-bearing animals into some place where they didn't use to exist — and ones they happen to be really fabulous ecosystem engineers the way that humans are — yeah, that's going to cause problems.Michael: Well, here is a sort of more focused or specific questions when it gets into the application or the translation of this science into street-level human activity, which is, it seems like you could use this as a lens to identify where there is a missing company in a particular economic system that you can say, Oh, that these people in this particular region are under-served through some missing piece of infrastructure, and that there's sort of deep biomimicry that we could use to start identifying how we've allowed this more piecemeal approach to technological innovation to bring things out of balance and how we could bring them back into balance.Jennifer: Yeah, I think many things are possible. But I mean I always kind of come back to why I got into food webs in the first place which is wanting to grapple with the whole system, but wanting to grapple with it in a quantitative kind of, simplified but quantitative way. Humans are very good at being reductionists and looking at little pieces of things and really kind of drilling down into that little piece, I mean it underlies a lot of our huge successes of physics and associated engineering in the 20th Century. That's great to a point but it can also end up leading you astray and we see this time and again in an ecological context. And so, for me yeah it's always that, what is the whole system? And what piece of it are you occupying and why? And if you want to alter it by taking something out or putting something in, what are the likely implications of that given a whole system look versus like this little teeny piecemeal look?And that sounds all very ethereal, but I'll give one ecological example. There was an eminent theoretical ecologist name Peter Yodzis who died of ALS a few years ago. He did some really cool food web modeling to kind of get at this point. So there's a number of systems where human fishers feel that they compete with seals or sea lions for fish and it still happens in various places around the world where there is a big cry to extirpate or exterminate the seals or sea lions because hey, they're eating our fish. And so if you think about it from a food web perspective here’s, humans are one node, seal or sea lions are another node, they both have links to some fish species of interest to both, and so that's like the simplest possible local little look at a little piece of a food web.And so human thinking goes, "Oh, we just get rid of the seal or the sea lion from this thing and all of a sudden that allows the population of the fish to grow because one their predators is gone, so they grow and then humans get more fish. Yay.” Great, however Peter Yodzis took this thing on and he basically said, "Let's put this into a food web" and he did this actually for a fishery called The Benguela Fishery off of South Africa. And so he took real data and he did some dynamical modeling, some fairly simple dynamical modeling and he did this thing where he didn't include humans exclusively, but he had a little food web and seals or in that case sea lions were a part of it, so in these little toy models and simulations he would pull those out completely or he would do a press perturbation where he would reduce the numbers of the sea lions and then he would run the population dynamics on this food web network and there we like three different fish species that the sea lions fed on that were also of interest to humans that humans want more of.So, pull the sea lions out or drastically reduce their numbers and, this is a probabilistic study, about half the time those fish species, their population would increase. But guess what? Half the time they went down because of all the indirect interactions, because it's not just the sea lions and the fish and the humans. There’s all of these other players and there's all these other pathways and all these loops and all these indirect effects. And because of all the complexity in the network, it was definitely not a sure thing that removing this other predator that is a competitor to humans was going to actually have the effect that humans want. And a lot of the times, it actually screws it up for humans and gives them fewer fish. So, that to me is just...he wrote a series of papers a while back where he kind of looked at this issue and I think it was very illuminating and really important.Michael: That is interesting. So, I'd like to wrap this up, you've given me an enormous amount of your time, I appreciate it.Jennifer: And I'm sure you've got a lot of material, you're going to have to weed through.Michael: Yeah but it'll be fine. I'd like to tie a bow on this by starting with a right angle, right, it’s how you have to tie a bow. And, I guess the question is, you've got two kinds of people listening to this show and some of them are science-track and some of them aren't, so what do you imagine to be the take away for people who are not pursuing scientific research? What do you hope that people carry out of this?Jennifer: Yeah, I mean I think what I hope people carry out of this is that we can use these approaches, these scientific approaches drawn from ecology and physics and archeology and that it’s really important and really useful to study humans as a part of their ecosystems and that we're just starting to really dive into a lot of detail about the variety of ways that humans are interacting with other species and how they're using technology to access resources and what that means for their interactions with other species. And what we're hoping and what we're staring to see is that, that's providing us a new way to think about sustainability, of coupled natural human systems, it really underlines how important it is to realize that human systems are not separate from environmental systems, they’re not separate from ecological systems, and that we gain a lot by studying them in an integrated transdisciplinary way.And the other thing just to underline is that we hear too often the doom and gloom of “humans are having negative impacts on the world in different kinds of ways and at different scales” and that's certainty going on but we also have very beautiful examples of humans as just kind of fitting into, and in some cases being really critical towards the kind of diversity and stabilization of, ecosystems. And there's very interesting lessons we can learn from that, that can hopefully help us to think about current sustainability and future sustainability.Michael: Awesome. The last question I have for you is a little bit more personal. I mean we've heard in this your story of being a kid playing in the creek to being the VP for Science at SFI and so you have an excellent position from which you can advise or council young people who are interested in pursuing a career in science. What advice would you give someone in 2019 who is interested in pursuing this life path?Jennifer: So I actually want to speak to the kids who think they're not interested in pursuing a career in science, because that's what I was, actually. I mean although I had my roots in being a little kid naturalist or whatever, I thought ultimately I didn't want to be a scientist. I mean I think the kids who want to be scientists will find ways to be scientists, which is great. To them I would say, avoid the silos. I mean the future of science and I think the most interesting and important questions are really the crossroads of traditional disciplines, and the fun part of science is working with people who have expertise that's totally different from yours.I mean, when I was a kid I wanted to be an archaeologist at some point, I wanted to be a paleobiologist at some point. I didn't become those things but now I grew up and I play with those people, I work with those people, I play with those people. So that's for the kids who already think they're on a science track, which is great. For the kids who think they aren't on a science track, or the people who think they aren't on a science track, I would say, science is way more fun and cool then you can even imagine and it's a living breathing kind of creating new understanding and forging new frontiers at its best. And it's a place where you can be incredibly curious and incredibly creative. I think a lot of people who aren't scientists don't understand how creative science is and how delightful that is. And it's a community, and we're standing on the shoulders of giants, and also we're standing on the shoulders of midgets. And most of us are midgets, but that's okay because a lot of midgets makes you a giant.Michael: Right, it's like an 80/20 giants/midgets kind of…well the other way, yeah.Jennifer: So yeah, so I would really...I think unfortunately because of misperceptions about what science is and how it operates and what it does, misperceptions I had for a long time, there's a lot who turn away from science who actually could have a lot to contribute to science especially because they have different brain set then someone who just comes up thinking I'm going to be a scientist or a mathematician and who misses, I think interesting opportunities to be creative and to contribute in very important ways to the world, and do so in a way that's very fulfilling personally.Michael: So maybe the capstone on this is that the meta is that there is a trophic network of knowledge that requires some measure of super-generalists, and a lot of specialists, and there's room in the scientific program for everyone.Jennifer: Yes, I think that's a really good way to use that metaphor drawn off of my and others’ food web research but yeah, there's room for many different minds and many different kinds of intelligence and many different kinds of creativity in science.Michael: Awesome. Well this has been a super inspiring conversation, Jennifer. Thanks a lot.Jennifer: Thank you. That was fun.Michael: Yeah.Jennifer: Yup, excellent.
6,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Well, Rajiv Sethi, it's a pleasure to have you on Complexity.Rajiv: Thank you for having me.Michael: Your work is such an interesting study of something that comes up again and again on this show, which is the inadequacy of our models in describing the true full intricacy of our world. And I think it's especially important in the economic and political settings in which you're applying your stuff. Maybe the right place to start this is to tell people a little bit about how you got into your research in the first place as a young man and how you came to care about these matters of information and belief and strategy.Rajiv: So, I think the earliest I can think of in my life where my interest in these issues was sparked was when I was 11 years old and my family moved from India to the United Kingdom. And I was suddenly in a place where I was a minority and treated as an outsider and often in ways that were quite unpleasant and unexpected, and started thinking about identity. And how that shapes interactions between people and assumptions that people make about each other. That's been a thread that's sort of run through my research ever since.Michael: So, how did you begin to explore this as a scientist? Like, where was your entry point?Rajiv: So I'm an economist by training and there's a significant part of economics that deals formally and systematically with information and beliefs, and the structure that is used in economics has its limitations. And so with my quote on the book that we're going to discuss in a bit, Brendan O'Flaherty, we've tried to use both insights from economics as well as from psychology and other disciplines to try to see how beliefs and information shape incentives and behavior.And the particular application that we've been working on, which was just published in this book in April, is to do with crime and criminal justice. But I've worked on information and beliefs more generally in other settings also.Michael: So, let's start with the more general and then get into the more specific. What do you see as the shortcoming of the Economic Game Theory that your work seeks to address?Rajiv: So, one of the shortcomings is what economists tend to assume about beliefs. We tend to assume, at least in most of the literature that beliefs are statistically correct, even if we have very little information. So we may be aware that we are uncertain. We're not systematically biased and we process information in rational ways based on some prior belief, we process information as statisticians would. And of course psychologists have a very different tradition in thinking about beliefs going back over a hundred years now, where for psychologists, once we form a belief about something that affects our processing of evidence. So we tend to accept evidence that confirms our prior beliefs more readily than evidence that contradicts them. And so Dan and I might go off the felt in this particular project that we needed to take those insights on board.Michael: The book in question is Shadows of Doubt. And it's about…well, essentially structural disparity in both impact and treatment in the criminal justice system. And I think in the introduction of that book, you make this as a very important distinction. And that's one I think worth unpacking here.Rajiv: Yes. So, disparate treatment refers to the fact that two people who was in the same circumstances are treated differently, whether it's regard to let's say, police stops or the use of force or arrest, incarceration, and so on and so forth. Sentencing, jury deliberations and decisions. So, you would have disparate impact if everything else were held constant but you change, let's say, the race or the gender of a particular individual that they would end up being treated differently. Sorry, that's disparate treatment. So disparate treatment is when two individuals who are in the same circumstances but belong to different identity groups are treated differently.But even if people are treated the same under any given set of circumstances, particular rules that are in place in society can end up with particular groups, having different impact for a given policy. So it could be subject to the same treatment, but you could end up with a particular group shouldering the bulk of the impact.So for example, suppose that the police treated black and white civilians in a given set of circumstances in exactly the same way, but police resources were directed towards particular neighborhoods with greater frequency than other neighborhoods. Then different groups would experience that. They would experience different impact even though in any given particular encounter they may be experiencing experiencing similar treatment.Michael: Yeah, that's a really interesting additional distinction that you make in this book about stereotypes that we carry of other people and the stereotypes that we carry of places. And the complex interrelationship between those. I'd love to hear you go into that a little bit more, especially concerning the way that we think of safe and unsafe spaces, and how that landscape can change.Rajiv: Yeah. Most of the book is about stereotypes about people, but people have stereotypes also about places. So one of the examples that we discuss in the book is that in Minneapolis for example, most calls for service from the police come from a very small set of locations. And some of these are well known to have, let's say, bar fights and brawls and so on and so forth. And people who go there know that this is likely to happen. And so that affects those who choose to avoid that place. It affects people who choose to seek out that place and so on.And so our behavior really changes depending on where we are at any given point in time. And that's also true of police behavior. So for example, there are particular areas in which one set of circumstances may lead to the use of force even though at a different location, the very same set of circumstances would not.Michael: To back this up a little bit, I guess it probably makes sense for us to unpack the empirical reality of the stereotyping human being in this conversation. And there's something in that distinction between disparate treatment and disparate impact that seems to get at the insufficiency of our models at both an individual and an aggregate level and how that leads to situations in which people end up falling through the cracks or places or people are not seen in their fullness, in their multidimensionality. But you also make the case in this book that doing so would be impossible, that we just can't process that much information.Rajiv: Right. So the way we define and think about stereotypes are as generalizations. We assign people to groups, correctly or incorrectly, we might sign them incorrectly. But having assigned them to groups, then we attribute to them characteristics that we believe are typical in the groups to which we have assigned them. So that's really roughly what we think about stereotypes. That's how we define stereotypes.Those beliefs about the group may be right or wrong. They may be more or less accurate, but we treat individuals not as in terms of their specific individuality, but as part of a collective. Now, the psychologists have recognized that to some extent that's inescapable, that we need to have these generalizations because we live in a complex and uncertain world and it would be too hard for us to treat every situation as unique.We both walked in here and sat down on these chairs, for example, without testing them to see if they take our weight because we assumed that they would do that, even though I certainly have not sat on this particular chair before. So, this is an example of what the psychologist Jerome Bruner called Equivalence Grouping. We take a bunch of objects and treat them as essentially the same even though they each have the unique individuality. And we can't navigate a complex world unless we do that. So in that sense, stereotyping is inevitable. It's a sort of cognitive necessity.However, our beliefs may be incorrect about a particular set of individuals just as they may be about a particular set of objects. And in that case psychologists have recognized that we treat information in somewhat biased ways. So, if we receive evidence that confirms what we believe about a set of people, we process it and accept it and update our beliefs more readily than if we receive information that is a stereotype disconfirming, that seems to fly in the face of what we already believe. And that's where the problems start to arise.So we can't escape the fact that we stereotype. I don't think anybody can, but we can become more aware of the process and we can be more willing to question the stereotypes that we hold.Michael: Yeah. I think ultimately that's the lesson, the takeaway from this book. And I want to circle back around into that because it's very practical and I think universal in a way that balances out a lot of the sort of more airy abstract theoretical stuff that goes on here very well. But I want to dig a little bit more into the actual dynamics of this stereotyping and how you and O'Flaherty have exposited this in the book.One of the things I found most disturbing about this was that you mentioned that the simple awareness of a cultural stereotype linking for example, as you do, African-Americans to violence, is a predictor of the extent of bias, whether or not the subject in question personally endorsed that stereotype. You reminds me of the recent research on how even if someone is being told they're given a placebo, the placebo effect is still in place. And so there's a sort of larger game theoretical issue around matters of openness and public information sharing and transparency around exposure to what you might consider problematic or toxic ideas. That seems to be aggravating this.Rajiv: Yeah, that's right. And I'll give you a couple of examples just to make it really concrete. So, for example, when you think about what we call crimes of appropriation — and this is not how the FBI classifies them, but if you think about crimes where people take other people's property — so burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft and robbery, these are the four major crimes of appropriation. Only robbery involves face to face interactions. It's in this circumstance that stereotypes come into play. Robbery involves a sequence of quick decisions. You're interacting with strangers on both sides of the interaction. People can't draw up on letters of recommendation from people that others have interacted with before. So if I confront you and ask you for your wallet, you have no information on how I reacted when somebody refused to give me their wallet in the past.Similarly, when I'm choosing whether to confront you or not, I have no idea how you're going to react to me and I can't go and ask for a reference from the last person who confronted you. So we are operating under a great deal of uncertainty.In this kind of situation, I'm going to target people that I stereotype as being more compliant. And furthermore, you are going to be more compliant when you're interacting with people whom you stereotype as being more likely to force compliance if you were to refuse. And this ends up affecting who engages in robbery, how robberies play out, and so on and so forth as compared to let's say burglaries or motor vehicle thefts or shoplifting, larceny and so on.And the thing is that people who are stereotyped, people who are negatively stereotype, so this is…they face a lot of dangers in our society. So people who are stereotyped as being violent will be more likely to face, let's say, lethal force by police. They are more likely to be killed in escalating disputes because if people fear them, that creates incentives for them to be killed preemptively and so on. We can get into this later if you like.So there's a lot of disadvantage in our society to being negatively stereotyped and being feared. But one environment in which being feared actually turns out to be lucrative and advantageous, is precisely robbery. If you're feared, even if there's no reason for people to fear you, it's a complete misconception. It makes robbery a lot easier than burglary and motor vehicle theft. You ask people for money and they will comply with you because they're afraid of you and so on.Now at the same time, robbery ends up leading to arrest and prison admission with much greater frequency than burglary and motor vehicle theft. This is part of the discussion we had about disparate impact industry treatment is relevant here. Why does robbery lead to arrest and prison admission with higher likelihood than burglary or larceny? Because it can be reported more quickly. You can give a description to the police, and so on and so forth. So even if there were no bias in the operation of the criminal justice system, people who commit robbery are more likely to be caught and punished for it than people who commit burglary and motor vehicle theft.Now, if people who are negatively stereotyped are more likely to commit robbery and they are the ones who are more likely also to be brought to justice, then the public imagination gets shaped by whom they see being arrested, whom they see being admitted to prison and whom they see within the incarcerated population. And this just reinforces the same negative stereotypes.So you end up with a system whereby the offending population is different from the population of arrestees and the population of those who are incarcerated in ways that reinforce the same stereotypes and keep these patterns in place. That's the way in which things are going on under the surface that may not be quite so visible unless you scratch the surface a bit and look underneath the hood.Michael: You mentioned elsewhere in the book, and you just touched on this, that similarly, feeling as though you can be the victim of violence with impunity, that you live in a neighborhood where the police are unlikely to actually show up and protect you in a case of necessity, means that you're more likely to actually strike first preemptively.Rajiv: This is, I think one of the really important lessons actually that we are trying to convey in this book. And it's that murder is the only serious crime that you may commit simply because you're afraid somebody was committed against you. It has a strong preemptive motive. And this has been recognized at least since the work of Thomas Schelling in his 1960 book The Strategy of Conflict. Basically, homicide has a preemptive motive. Even if you gain nothing from killing somebody, you'd rather kill them than be killed by them.And what can make you fearful of being killed? Well, one thing that can make you fearful is if you think you're going to be killed with impunity. If the person who kills you is not going to be brought to justice. And in the United States, historically for centuries, for a variety of reasons, when the victim of homicide is African-American, the likelihood that the offender, whether the offender is black or white, the likelihood that the offender will be brought to justice has been significantly lower than when the victim of homicide is white.And what that means is that, that you can be killed with impunity more often if you're black, than you can be killed with impunity if you're white. And this changes the level of fear in interactions. Now, why is it, why is it that in this day and age today, the homicide clearance rate — that refers to the proportion of homicides which ended up resulting in arrest of an individual suspect — why is it that the clearance rate for homicides with black victims is much lower than the clearance rate for homicides with white victims? Well, there are two stories that are told about this. You can think about one as being the community view and one is being the law enforcement view.So the community view is that people don't care about black lives. So if a black life is taken, the amount of investment of resources, law enforcement resources in trying to solve that murder and try to bring a perpetrator justice is going to be lower because people don't care as much. And so you're going to get more killing with impunity.The law enforcement view is that, no there are strong incentives for homicide detectives to solve every single homicide, but they don't get witness cooperation. So it's much harder for them to solve homicides if witnesses are unwilling to come forward because without witness cooperation, it just makes the task of identifying and bringing a perpetrator to justice that much harder.Now, I think there's truth to both these perspectives. Certainly, historically it has been the case that, there's plenty of evidence in the book that people just haven't cared so much when the victim of homicide is black. But it's also true that witness cooperation is less forthcoming on average when the victim of homicide is black.Now let's think about why that might be. So, if you think about New York City's stop-and-frisk policy, which had at its peak about a decade ago, about 600,000 police stops per year were conducted. And that's down to about 10,000 now as a result of some court cases and the change in administration.And in New York City, when you stop somebody, you're not allowed to do it simply based on race or gender or ethnicity. There has to be reasonable articulable suspicion. It's a lower standard than probable cause. But it's still a standard. You'd have to articulate why are you stopping this person? There's a form that has to be filled out.Now, if you look at those forms and you look at the cases where the suspicion was that the individual had a weapon, so you're stopping them under suspicion of having a weapon. About 97% of those stops did not result in weapon recovery. So you were mistaken about the fact that the individual had a weapon, which means you're stopping a whole bunch of people who are innocent and are going to be aggravated by that. And to the extent that these stops disproportionately affected African-American and Latino civilians, which there is evidence that they did, you’re going to have a whole bunch of innocent people that distrust and even despise the police.Those people are not going to be likely to come forward as witnesses, even for very serious crimes like murder. And so you get this situation where generalized aggression in policing can give rise to a greater ability possibly to solve minor crimes, while making it harder to solve the really big ones like murder.Michael: This is a real Gordian knot, it seems, a real rat king of problems. A perfect example of complexity in that there doesn't appear, at least to me, to be an ultimate cause that we can point to or an ultimate single silver bullet solution to this. But…Rajiv: Well, there's been work actually by some computer scientists at Stanford and others trying to see, well, what would be the consequences of having more carefully targeted police stops? Reducing the number of police stops, applying a probable cause standard rather than the reasonable suspicion standard? And their claim, they tried to predict the likelihood of contraband recovery or weapon recovery in any particular stop. They have models that do this, and they feel based on their data analysis that you could recover most weapons with substantially fewer stops.So, there are policies that are suggested by this kind of reasoning that one could scale back, apply a strict standard, so that fewer innocence have their lives disrupted. Because ultimately better police-community relations are critical if you're going to have witness cooperation.Now, there are many other reasons you may not have witness cooperation. People may have a historical memory that prevents these policies from leading to substantial improvement in police-community relations. But there are policies that are suggested by the data that aren't all that difficult to implement, or all that complex.Michael: I'm thinking, I guess, of…we had one of our postdocs here, Albert Kao, who published recently on how the longer the memory of the individual nodes in a network, there's a threshold at which the network actually starts getting dumber in the aggregate. So I wonder, that seems to extend to issues of what you might call like a kind of overfitting of people that continue to select into the reinforcement of stereotypes. And almost a point in favor of the half-life of cultural memory and allowing us to be flexible enough as a society to update our beliefs about each other.Rajiv: That's a really interesting point, and I should look at that work actually, because I do think that the longer the cultural and historical memory, the more difficult it becomes to adjust to changes in policy. You react as if the policy had not changed essentially. And this goes back to what we discussed earlier about confirmatory bias, this phenomenon that psychologists have identified, where evidence that confirms stereotypes is more likely to be accepted and evidence that disconfirms.And so they may have been a time where a certain stereotype, whether it's stereotype of bumps, civilians by police or whether it's stereotypes about police by civilians, there may have been a time in which the stereotype was reasonably accurate. And if that memory isn't allowed to fade in the face of changes in behavior and changes in policy, then it's going to cast a shadow on current interactions in ways that make policies actually less effective. You're absolutely right. That's a relevant reference to bring up.Michael: There's another thing that I'm really curious about here because so much of the horrific exchanges that you talked about in this book as occurring between people who meet each other face-to-face seem to be mirrored in exchanges that people have with one another online. And when people…just, as someone who has to spend as much time as I do on Twitter watching the carnival funhouse mirror, nightmare of inflammatory identity-political conflict, online. I wonder how you see that setting being similar to, and being different from, in-person settings.Rajiv: Well, one of the things we point out in the book is that, the Internet has caused certain things about individual histories to become permanent in ways that they weren't in the past. If you did something bad or something good and your community or your neighborhood knew about it, they'd have a more balanced picture of what you've done. And what happens with the way in which information is stored and shared now is that certain acts get permanently assigned to certain identities and you don't get a complete picture of individuals and what the consequences of this are really have yet to be fully thought out and understood whether or not Twitter leads to greater polarization or not, there are studies ongoing about this. We're not really quite sure yet. Certainly you see that the impression one gets is that it's extraordinarily polarized.But I'll give you an example of something that's on Twitter just yesterday and it was by a journalist. I forget the name, but describing a whole bunch of direct messages that they got from Latinos and Latinas in response to some of the rhetoric about immigration that's been very salient over the last couple of years, especially in the light of the El Paso massacre. And one of the things that was described was about a couple of individuals who had a Latino taxi driver and gave him a fake hundred-dollar bill as a tip and it was folded so that it wouldn't be realized soon enough and they were laughing as they got out of the cabin. So on and so forth. And that made me think a little bit about what we assume about online interactions as opposed to the older, more offline interactions.If you think about, let's say just taxi cabs, there was a lot of discussion at one point and perfectly legitimate about taxi cabs profiling passengers for a variety of reasons. What they expected about the size of the tip, the likely destination, the likelihood of being held up and so on and so forth was causing individuals to stereotype past some folks in favor of others and so on. And that was a terrible thing in New York City has had countless complaints about this historically and as attempted at various points in time to try to address this problem. And there was some folks who suggested that, well, once you have Uber and Lyft and in your online cabs, perhaps the anonymity of that process may cause that discrimination to diminish.But once you think about how the reward system works in these online networks, it's possible that somebody who gives you a perfectly good service but belongs to an ethnic group to which you have any version might end up receiving a low rating from you for no reason other than the fact that you have some animosity towards them. Similar to the idea of playing a joke on somebody by giving them counterfeit currency as a tip. And that can give rise to very distorted statistics such as ratings of cab drivers or delivery persons on online.So this is all very new and we're still trying to understand these effects. And I don't think we do much in the book with this, but we do mention it.Michael: Well, one way that I see a really strong correlation between the online interaction and the in-person interaction on the street is that, as you make the case, so many of these...you give an example in the conclusion of a young man who was in a failed carjacking and accidentally shot himself and then in the ambulance confesses to two crimes earlier that week and is sentenced, at the age of 15, to 25 years in prison.And there's something about the lifelong consequences of choices that are made under conditions of duress or coercion, or at least decisions that have to be made very fast about each other. And that there seems to be an issue about the time horizon and like you said at the beginning that, so much of this is about us not having the time to proof and check everything and investigate every experience as a unique experience and investigate every person we meet as a unique person. And that there's something about the way that we...whether it's in person or it's on the Internet, about the way that we signal and that we present to one another. That it seems almost as though the book is a map of the tragedy of the limited time that we have to evaluate each other and the decisions that we make.Rajiv: Yeah. Actually in a review of the book The Economist, Diane Coyle called it sobering. And so in a sense it's not most uplifting book to read. We just laid out the situation as we saw it.The incident that you described, actually it's the person there who as a juvenile was tried as an adult because in the ambulance he confessed it to, two robberies, involving very small amounts of money. And then was prosecuted under the Three Strikes law in California. That person actually is the cousin of the great political philosopher, Danielle Allen, who is a University professor at Harvard. And the incident is described in her recent book, Cuz. I won't go into too much detail about the story of her cousin Michael, but he died at a very young age after release from prison. He was tried as an adult and really it was a botched robbery, not a carjacking. But it was, yeah, somebody who was attending to their car. Right. So there was a car in the picture. And that's a book I highly recommend.But what Danielle does in that book, first of all, she humanizes her cousin. She knows all the different aspects of his character. What's in the public record is just a very limited story. He was a very courageous  firefighter, a lot of incarcerated population in California is called upon, to come out and fight fires in an emergency. And he did that to great effect. He was also a poet. He wrote some remarkable things, but had Danielle not humanized him in that way, the rest of the world would just know him as a juvenile offender.And actually there's another very popular and very important book by Bryan Stevenson, which many of your listeners would know, Just Mercy, which does this over and over again with many, many people. And this process of humanization is absolutely critical. I think if we're going to have substantial movement towards the criminal justice system that fits with international norms. We’ve departed so far from it. About two or three generations ago, the US incarcerated population was not that great relative to the broader population when you made international comparisons. Now it's such an extreme outlier. There's nobody even close, I think, Russia second, but it's still far behind.And this process of humanization, partly because of all the way in which the racial and ethnic divisions in our society are mapped out in the way in which they reflected in the way in which people have attitudes towards those who are incarcerated, the humanization processes is really important.And one other point I'll make is, this is a reference to a different book by John Pfaff, who's at Fordham Law School as a very good recent book called Locked In, where he points out, although a lot of the discussion nowadays is about decarceration of nonviolent offenders. But you're not going to have, John Pfaff points out, and correctly points out in my opinion, that are not going to have significant decarceration unless you deal with the length of sentences and the severity of punishment for people who have committed crimes that are classified as violent. They may have been present when murder was committed or an aggravated assault or a robbery which is classified as a violent crime.So the incident that you mentioned is part of this story of humanization that I think is really important if decarceration efforts are going to really take hold going forward in time.Michael: To pseudo-mathematize this, it seems as though everywhere we look in this conversation we have runaway positive feedback loops.Rajiv: Yes.Michael: And that the solutions, plural, that have to be brought to bear on this situation are about interventions as early as possible in the runaway positive feedback.Rajiv: Yes. In fact that's what makes the situation sobering, actually because positive feedback loops lock us into equilibrium. If you want to describe it that way in mathematical terms that are hard to shake, it's hard to escape. We are stuck in some ways. Marcellus Andrews, another economist who's a friend of mine, describes the world we live in as a stereotype trap. The stereotypes have incentive effects that cause people to behave in particular ways and give rise to certain patterns in the data that, because of what is hidden versus what is revealed and because of our psychological machinery end up reinforcing those very stereotypes. And I think the idea of a stereotype trap, it's a very good way to describe the condition that we're in, makes it very hard to escape.I mentioned to you earlier some policies that could be implemented fairly easily, at least with regard to generalized aggression in policing, greater clearance rates for homicides, better community-police relations in order to elicit greater witness cooperation.There's a bunch of stuff we discussed in the book about gun laws as well. This is topical now with what's happened recently in El Paso, in Dayton. And so there are things that can be done. Things aren't as sobering, I guess, as the first appear. But you're right, there's a sense in which the positive feedbacks lock us into a situation that then becomes hard to escape. But our approach is that we need to first understand the processes if we're going to do something about them. And most of the book is just trying to lay out things that are below the surface and that aren't easily exposed.Michael: Earlier you mentioned the street level interaction of a robbery and how both parties in that interaction are sizing each other up. Listening to you talk about that, I had this sort of absurd thought that, like, what if we had a Yelp for criminals, you could be like, “In spite of the fact that I was coerced into giving that person my wallet, it was relatively pleasant exchange.” But then of course you get into this whole thing about how that is just another venue for another potential runaway chain reaction where the ratings end up reinforcing a public image for someone else. This gets to some of the other work that you've done more broadly on public disagreement.Rajiv: Yeah.Michael: And on what it means for there to be public information and private information. How we rate each other in terms of being well understood about our transparent biases, or well-informed. I'd love to hear you open up into that.Rajiv: Sure.Michael: And talk a little bit about that and how you see those two issues relate.Rajiv: Sure. I'd be happy to do that. And this is joint work with Muhamet Yildiz who is an economist at MIT. And really it's also connected to what we've been talking about because it involves identity, in some respects. So again, to go back to what economists typically assume about the statistical accuracy of people's beliefs, there's an assumption — I won’t go into it in too much detail. That's referred to as “the common prior assumption” in Economics, which essentially says that when two people disagree about something, it's because they have different information. So it's not because they have different biases or because they have different prior beliefs in a Bayesian or statistical sense. This is called the common prior assumption. We both reason from the same prior belief, we receive different information. We'll update and have disagreement.But one of the consequences of that way of thinking, which was highlighted very beautifully in the 1976 paper by Robert Aumann, was that although we can disagree, we can't agree to disagree. In other words, the fact of our disagreement ought to be informative. The fact that we disagree or to tell us that we have different information and we ought to then update our beliefs and come closer to each other actually. And if we still disagree, that means we haven't fully absorbed the information that the other party has received and so on and so forth.There's a very nice paper called, “We Can't Disagree Forever” by John Geanakoplos and Heracles M. Polemarchakis. And John Geanakoplos as a longstanding association with the Santa Fe Institute, as you know. And this paper really takes Aumann's idea and says, look, suppose that two people with a common prior have different information. And they just announced their beliefs repeatedly, sequentially, what's going to happen in the long run? And they show that, in a well-defined sense, they will converge to the same belief in a finite number of steps, under a certain set of circumstances.Now that's a very nice mathematical result, but that's not what we see in the world. We have public disagreement all the time about various issues and in fact. And recognize this and the purpose of his paper was really to lay out the assumptions under which you would not get that. So that when we see the public disagreement we can start to think well which of Aumann's assumptions as being violated.And my work with Muhamet sort of departs from the standard setup by allowing people to have heterogeneous prior beliefs, so that the starting point on the basis of which we then process information may differ across individuals. And in that case we could end up with different beliefs even if we have the same information, and we could end up with public disagreement. And a lot of what we do is to think about, well how do we then update? When I observe your opinion about something, it's conflated because your opinion is the result of two different things. It's your prior, which from my point of view is just a bias, right? If it differs from my prior belief.But you also have information and I understand that you have information. So for me to make an inference from your opinion, I need to try to untangle what is a bias from my opinion, from my point of view, and what is genuine information that is valuable to me. And so what Muhamet and I have done is try to look at this process.And one of the questions that we look at is, well what does that imply for, where are we going to seek out information? So this goes back to your point about Twitter and polarization and so on. And really this is one of the areas of my work that I still find very absorbing and interesting. So I'm glad you brought it up.This work illustrates a certain tradeoff that hasn't been explored much in economics and we think not much in social science more generally. And it's a tradeoff between people who are well-understood and people who are well-informed. So this is a tradeoff that you mentioned.What do we mean by well-informed? Well, when informed just means that you have good information about the world. So, for example, an economist may be well-informed, let's say about the unemployment rate or the process by which the unemployment rate is computed and so on. A climate scientist may be well-informed about the degree to which a business-as-usual scenario is going to give rise to an increase in global temperature and which areas will be most effected. So this is what we mean by well-informed, which is the common understanding of the term.But it's also important to think about people who are well-understood. So somebody is well understood in our setup if their biases are accurately understood by an observer. So it's a relational property. So, I may know that you're very well-informed because you're an expert in climate science, but you'll still be very poorly understood by me if I don't know your biases. If I'm very uncertain about whether you have a predisposition to believe one thing versus another about climate change. And if you are poorly understood by me, despite being well-informed, I may decide that you're not a good source of information for me. I don't know where you're coming from. I don't know where your biases are and I might actually go and seek information from somebody who is less well-informed than you, because they are better understood by me.So this tradeoff gives rise to patterns of observation both online and offline, whose blogs I read, which newspapers I subscribed to, which TV shows I watch, whom I follow on Twitter and so on, which might reflect the fact that I follow people who are more poorly informed than others, simply because I have a better idea of what their biases are, where they're coming from. I can better interpret their opinions and back out the information that those opinions contain.And this is something that arises even if my only goal is information. It's not just reinforcement of my own views, which may also be that a phenomenon that is at play here. But even if my only goal is to seek information, I may still seek it from people who are less well-informed because their biases are more transparent to me. This is just sort of an overview of the kind of themes that we're exploring.Michael: It's interesting that there's an economy in that decision.Rajiv: There is.Michael: Which is to seek out sources of information that require the least effort to understand.Rajiv: That's right. And actually...so here's something that we find in our research, which is that, when I observe your opinion and I try to make an inference from it, I learn about three things actually. I learn about the world, which is what I care about. I learn about you. I actually learn something about your bias too. And I learn also about what we call your culture. I learned something about the biases of people who have similar biases to you. And what that does is it makes me more inclined to seek information from you in the future. By observing you, you become better understood by me and not only you, but people who are similar to you also become better understood by me.And so there's this, again, we talked about positive feedbacks. There's a tendency for people to seek information from sources that they have consulted in the past with greater frequency as they move forward into the future. So there's another path dependence, another positive feedback effect, in that respect. And there's an irony there because you may be actually well informed today about an issue that I care about. And so I seek information from you that allows me to better learn your biases and tomorrow I may seek information from you even though it's about an issue about which you're quite poorly informed, simply because your biases are more transparent to me. So I hope that was reasonably clear.Michael: Yeah. There's another angle to this that I've observed in interpersonal relations, which is: a lot of people, whether it's in this very real and grave criminal justice context or whether it's just in intimate relationship, most people want to feel understood. However, there's labor involved in becoming understood.When we talk about the economics of this, like part of it is the effort expended in educating a stranger or even in an intimate relationship. And that seems to be another obstacle toward the kind of process of restorative justice more broadly. And maybe more personally just people coming together in synthesis and good faith dialogue.Rajiv: Yeah. So let me give you another example from the book that's also very well known actually. This goes back to a memoir by Brent Staples who's the writer for The New York Times. He's also a psychologist by training as a PhD in Psychology from the University of Chicago. And there's a very famous incident that described in a memoir that he published in the 1990s where he would take walks along the lake while he was a graduate student and would find people visibly afraid of him. They would be clutching their bags or they would be trying to move away across the street, or just seemed to be fearful of him. Although he knew in his own mind that there was nothing to be afraid of. And he's a graduate student. He happened to be African-American, tall, and so on.And he found himself inspiring fear in passers-by as he walked down past the lake, and realized that he's being misunderstood, and it bothered him, it upset him. And there are similar incidents that are described over and over again. You can find many instances of this there's a book by Paul Butler who's at Georgetown Law School who describes very similar kind of feeling of being feared over and over again. There was a speech by the South Carolina Senator, Tim Scott, who is very conservative on most issues with a very emotional speech on the Florida Senate where he himself was treated with suspicion even by staff who were screening people entering the Senate building. So this is a very common occurrence.So what's interesting is the investment that Staple's made in trying to shift this stereotype, and you talked about investment in trying to become better understood. So what Brent Staples did, and he describes this in his memoir is that he started to whistle — initially out of nervousness. And he realized that he was in tune and very good at whistling and he started to whistle Vivaldi, The Four Seasons by Vivaldi, and tunes from the Beatles. And this whistling in tune, which people recognized completely shifted the stereotypes. So people would smile at him, people would nod at him, instead of being afraid. So he was able to shift the stereotype to an investment, if you like, into something that caused him in his own mind to be better understood, which was one of the goals that he was trying to achieve.But what's less well known in the very same memoir is that, Brent Staples just got a bit fed up with this — and you can imagine the frustration having to make an investment so that people are not afraid of you. And he decided for a time to act in stereotype-confirming ways, and just to act in ways that would make people more afraid. I think it was just the frustration with the fact that he was having to bear these costs in order to dispel stereotypes that he felt should not have been applied to him in the first place. Not going out and threatening assaulting or robbing people, but simply not taking the trouble to sound and look harmless and friendly.And he saw that he was able, just by his posture and just by his demeanor, to instill fear in people. And he came to the recognition, actually, and he says this explicitly in his memoir, that if he wanted to rob somebody, all he would have to do is just stand there. Not even asked them for the money they were just handed over. They were that afraid of him.And this actually got me and Dan also thinking about the incentive effects of stereotypes, and really, for somebody like Brent Staples — and of course he was getting Doctorate in Psychology; he had no interest in robbing people — but if somebody were interested in taking appropriating the property of others, if people were that afraid of you, even though there's no reason for it, it becomes much easier for you to engage in robbery than burglary or motor vehicle theft. And if you are somebody who cannot instill fear in people, then you either have to make investments in menacing facial tattoos or something, or you're going to go and choose other crimes like burglary or motor vehicle theft or larceny.And so you're going to end up beneath the surface with the sorting of individuals and their crimes where people who instill fear are going to choose robbery. And people who don't are going to choose burglary. And as I said to you earlier, robberies are much more likely to lead to rest and prison admission than burglaries. Burglary is a much harder to solve. You don't even realize you've been burgled sometimes until you come back from vacation. And, that reinforces these stereotypes. That's back to the positive feedbacks that you described earlier.In the positive feedbacks have been a theme that has been explored at the Santa Fe Institute all the way back from its inception. Brian Arthur's work in the 1980s and so on. And so in a sense this sort of fits with that tradition, but it is sobering as Diane Coyle said to think about it.Michael: There is another SFI External Professor, Raissa D'Souza. And Raissa’s work when she recently presented at the Science Board Symposium, this video’s up on YouTube about The Collapse of Networks and how as a network grows, the number of low degree edge relations grows and it becomes easier and easier for a cascading failure to propagate through the network. And not to flog this issue, but it does seem as though the scale to invoke Geoffrey West, another important SFI researcher and his work on the scaling laws of cities and how the more interactions we have per day the faster our lives move, certain properties emerge out of that. And one of these properties seems to be that, we are having more and more of these ephemeral, fleeting, seemingly inconsequential encounters with strangers. And it seems to me as though one of the things that we see in the polarization of a global conversation is people feeling as though, again, that they can speak with impunity to one another.It's precisely the opposite of what you've observed in this conversation, that the consequences are even more grave because of the sort of permanent record that we now all possess. And so, I mean, how do you see this as linked to this particular issue of the structure of networks and does that offer…I want to find a way to segue this into what I think is the most important place where we could possibly end this. It’s where you and Dan write in the book on the issue of hope. Does seeing the problem clearly inspire hope, and does the fact that it seems as though our society is only getting faster, and that modern society perhaps gives us fewer affordances for the kind of deep and human relationships we need in order to undo this kind of a thing. Like where are we in this mess?Rajiv: I wish I knew. I think it's the crucial question really of our age, right? It's really going to determine where we go from here. I used to be more optimistic generally about communication that the truth will win out. I’m a bit of a First Amendment purist in and disregard and have become increasingly pessimistic about the ability to instill false belief in others strategically. The ability for us to withstand that effort seems to be limited. We need mechanisms in place whereby we can clearly identify trusted sources. And I don't think we have those yet.Going back to the issue of hope in the book, again, I think I'm predisposed to be optimistic, and so maybe I'm biased over here. But to us in the book, it's connected to humanization and we feel that there are efforts — by Danielle Allen as I mentioned to you, by Bryan Stevenson — to humanize people who may have committed even heinous crimes in the past to reveal them, to have redeeming features, to reveal them, to be capable of rehabilitation.So hope and humanization are really linked to each other. Now we live in a time where rhetoric involves a lot of dehumanization. And recently we've heard a lot about people being characterized as vermin, about infestations, about invasions, and this is deeply dehumanizing. And the question really is whether or not it's going to stick or it's going to provoke a backlash that will cause us to find this kind of rhetoric intolerable. And I think we're going to see that play out over the next few months and years. And that's going to tell us, really, whether there's basis for hope. But we have a battle right now between dehumanization and humanization. And I am, I would say, pessimistic in the short run and optimistic in the long run. But that may reflect the stereotype on my part, and I'm open to revisiting that and changing my view on it as time unfolds and as evidence becomes available.Michael: Yeah, I mean when you talk about there being, in the two scenarios, one in which members of a disagreement have common priors and one in which they don’t, obviously it's not a binary. And if we dig deep enough, I'm sure that we can find common priors. And that the depth that we have to dig to find them is therefore the variable that allows us to calculate the actual curvature of that long arc of justice in history. Right? How far back do we have to go to find a common ground upon which we can discuss our differences?Rajiv: Yeah, that's an interesting perspective on this. That was Harsanyi’s original defensive of the common prior assumption: that, we should if we see disagreement, we should try to understand it and trace it to particular factors. That there's no basis for assuming heterogeneous priors to begin with. We found it useful as a modeling assumption because we want to explain disagreement, which, really can't arise under the common prior assumption, and various auxiliary assumptions that I usually made. But that's an interesting way to look at it. Whether or not there's a basis for hope is really tied to the question of whether or not we can see in each other our common humanity.Michael: Well, Rajiv, this has been an amazing conversation. It's an honor to sit with you and talk about this. Thank you for your time.Rajiv: Thank you for giving me the opportunity.
7,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: So, Olivia Judson, it is a pleasure to explore complexity with you today.Olivia: Thank you.Michael: You gave a superb talk last night on the dance of rock in life, a public presentation of this piece that you published in Nature in 2017, “The Energy Expansions of Evolution.” So, this is the paper I want to reference for this talk, because this is a really, a fascinating synthesis.Maybe the correct place to start is just to have you lay out the most basic outline of it, and then we can dive into more detail.Olivia: So, I came to this project sort of indirectly. It wasn't my plan to look at the coevolution of life and Earth, the way that life has shaped the planet and the planet has shaped life over its 4.5 billion year history, but I came to it sort of by accident. I've found it absolutely fascinating ever since.As I started to understand the extent to which living organisms have shaped the non-living world, I started to ask myself whether I was just making an enormous list of impacts from everything from the color of the sky to the number of minerals here today. I realized that actually I did see a pattern in the history of life and Earth.That pattern, you could say it like this. The history of life on Earth can be divided into five epochs, each which corresponds to organisms evolving to use a new form of energy. The thing that is very interesting to me about this is that although the first two forms of energy were present when the planet formed, the remaining three are all consequences of this dance of rock and life.There are events in the evolution of life that feed back into the evolution of the planet, which then goes on to shape the future evolution of life.The energy epochs are geochemical energy, which you could sort of think of as rock energy, sunlight, oxygen, flesh, and fire.Michael: Excellent. So, yeah, this is a fresh way of looking at this. I mean, it seems in retrospect, The Atlantic wrote a piece on this when you first published this where they interviewed a bunch of other researches who were like oh I wish that I would have said it first. It's like one of those papers that seems so obvious in retrospect.One of the things that your paper does really well and that you did really well in your talk last night was to explain how the availability of energy resources determines the pace and the timing of major evolutionary transitions. There is, for example, a prehistory to flesh eating and a prehistory to the aerobic metabolism. I'd love to hear you talk about that and how this changes the way that we think of the step-wise order in which new evolutionary innovations lead to new niches, and so on.Olivia: So, one of the things that I learned... When I started this program, I didn't really know anything much about Earth history. I came to understand as I read more and more about it. I realize more and more how ignorant I had been, and it made me see that the picture of evolution that I had learned as a student, which was very much based just on thinking about genes and DNA and information, was not sufficient to explain some very long periods of delay in our history. Delay with respect to explaining why, for example, did it take four billion years for the first animals to appear?Why did it take more than 300 million years for oxygen to accumulate in the atmosphere after the bacteria that produce it here appeared? I started to understand that actually the broader trends in evolution when you're looking over Earth history that they can only really be understood in context with the planet itself. Just thinking about information alone isn't really enough to explain some of these very long periods of delay.But in fact that there is a resource problem. I focused on energy, but of course there are multiple lenses through which one could look at this subject. You could also focus on limiting nutrients. Like is iron going to be available? Is zinc going to be available? There are people who have studied the sort of trajectory of evolution in the context of the chemical availability that changes over planetary history in response to the activities of organisms.So, to give a particular example, all eukaryotes, which is every organism you've ever seen with your naked eye. All eukaryotes use zinc in their proteins, but zinc does not actually become available to organisms to use, not widely available anyway, until after you have oxygen in the atmosphere.So, eukaryotes evolve, and there's already oxygen when they do, but then there's a long period of delay before eukaryotes become abundant. That, I think, remains mysterious, actually. I don't think we understand why that is the case. There are a couple of ideas. One geological, one ecological. Maybe it's both things together.So, you see around 800 million years ago, which is a billion years after eukaryotes first form, you see that eukaryotes are starting to diversify in the fossil record. But you can sort of say, well, is there something we didn't understand about the fossil record? Is it just that perhaps there was more diversification and it didn't fossilize? But there's an independent question that you can ask, which is because eukaryotes use zinc, you can also say does anything change in the zinc cycle?This is very recent work that has come out that is not mine, but very recent work that has come out looking at how the draw down of zinc occurs over time. Actually you discover that the zinc cycle changes at exactly the time you would expect based on the fossil record of eukaryote diversification. So, you have two parallel independent confirmations that actually, yes, there was a one billion year delay, which I find fascinating.Michael: Something like this, you mentioned in the paper, around the Great Oxidation Event — that photosynthesis floods the atmosphere with oxygen, but it takes forever. You mentioned that a lot of this has to do with natural geochemical cycling, the re-uptake and absorption of oxygen by the rocks themselves. We had to reach a sort of critical mass of photosynthetic cyanobacteria that in order to actually create this shift in the composition of the atmosphere that enable the proliferation of the aerobic metabolism that already existed. Right?So, there's something kind of easily generalizable, universal about this — about the nature of innovation and the notion of “an idea whose time has come,” if we can kind of try and connect innovation and human activity to evolutionary innovation. I mean, I'm curious what you see as the abstract or universal there.Olivia: Well, I think that there are two things. I mean, I think that you can certainly say that there are limitations. There are constraints. Those constraints cannot be overcome until, for example, you either have a new energy source or a new way of using that energy source. So, one of the great innovations in the history of life is the evolution of the eukaryotic cell, which does seem to have been a unique event in four billion years of evolution.That, I think, raises some interesting and important questions. It's hard to know exactly how to phrase this, but how did it come to be that this was able to happen, when it seems like... I mean, from my point of view as eukaryotes, it sort of seems like an inevitable event. But when we look at Earth history, I think we can say that actually it was an extremely unusual thing to happen.And I don't think there's necessarily any inevitability around it, but I don't know. I'm not sure that I'm managing to answer this question at all, actually. [Laughs]Michael: You mentioned in the origin of eukaryotic cells, “In extant eukaryotes, organelles and mitochondrial origin take several different but related forms. Notably only one, the standard mitochondrion found for example in humans, requires oxygen. Three others are involved in forms of anaerobic metabolism.These observations fit with the hypothesis advanced by Martin and colleagues that the ancestral eukaryote resulted from a prior symbiotic association between a hydrogen dependent archaeon and a metabolically flexible alpha proteobacterium that in the absence of oxygen lived anaerobically producing hydrogen and in the presence of oxygen, lived aerobically. If this hypothesis is correct, the ancestral eukaryote could have been a facultative anaerobe, able to live in both oxic and anoxic environments.”So, this question of the innovation before it stabilizes is an interesting question. How, much as we saw with the Cambrian Explosion, innovation, it seems to go through a sort of radiative exploratory phase where the selection pressure is on flexibility. Then it settles into something a little bit more formal and concrete.Olivia: Well, I mean I think I think about evolution a bit differently. I think one of the people who... So, Stuart Kauffman who obviously has been a long term associate with the Santa Fe Institute, coined the term “the adjacent possible.” And I think that one of the things that we have come to understand is that natural selection and evolution, they're not magic wands. Right?Evolution by natural selection only works if each mutational step itself is advantageous. So, you have a mutation. And there's no such thing as advantageous in a general sense. It's advantageous in the circumstances you're living in. So, it's very environment-dependent what is advantageous and what isn't.But just because something would be useful doesn't mean it will necessarily evolve, or it doesn't mean it will necessarily evolve soon. So, one of the clearest demonstrations of this, I think, has come about from the Lenski very-long term evolution experiment on E. coli bacteria, which has been going on I think since 1988 or 1990. And every day somebody changes the E. coli from one vat to another. They grow, and it's gone through 70 or 80,000 generations now, I think. So, it's a very long term evolutionary experiment. The bacteria are growing in a very circumscribed particular lab environment, but it's been constant for the whole time.But the interesting thing is that in the growth medium there is something called citrate, which E. coli cannot normally grow on, but it's very abundant whereas glucose is limited. So, you would expect that if it was advantageous to be able to eat this stuff, the citrate, that it would evolve. But in fact in the 12 populations, at least the last time I checked, in the 12 populations it had only evolved once and that only happened after about 35,000 generations.So, it's a nice demonstration of how in order to find an evolutionary solution, sometimes there's a lot of meandering, and there's no particular direction to the solution. The E. coli probably don't even know there's a problem, so to speak, that they're trying to solve.The reason that they're able to solve it is because they reproduce very quickly, and also in very large numbers. So, if you're a bacterium reproducing very quickly in large numbers, you get to explore the mutation space pretty reliably.But it turns out that there's a path dependence to get to being able to use the citrate. So, in order to get the mutation to use the citrate, you have to have at least one or two other mutations first that have to join up. So, that's why it was only in one of these 12 populations.The thing that's nice about the Lenski experiment is that every 500 generations they freeze some of the organisms. So, in principle, they can restart from any point in the past and do it again. They did this, and that's how they found that there was actually a facilitating mutation on the road to citrate use. I think the point of this is that sometimes just because you want to get there from here, doesn't mean it's easy or straightforward or direct. I think that that's one of the possible explanations for why the eukaryotic cell has only evolved once.First of all, I think it's actually very difficult, because although we think of internal parasites or symbiotes as being very common in biology, they're actually only very common in eukaryotes. It's a feature of eukaryotes that they can have other organisms living inside their cells like bacteria, for example.You see this in insects. A lot of time you see it in the other human gut microbiome and so on. You see that there's a lot of intimate associations with other organisms inside the body. In bacteria and archaea, which are both prokaryotes, you don't actually see this. Now, it's possible that we haven't sampled it enough, because so many of these organisms are obscure to us, and we've never managed to even see them with a microscope let alone to grow them in the laboratory.But I think that from what we can see, internal symbiotic associations are very, very rare. So, I think of it as a double problem, the evolution of the eukaryotic cell. It's getting in and then getting along. I think both are hard problems, but I think that it's also not necessarily clear, that at least in a microbial world, that there's any particular advantage to being a eukaryote. So, it's not clear that there was any drive towards that either.Michael: I know that you went to Oxford with David Krakauer, right? As we were just talking about before this recording, my entrance to complexity was with the work that he coauthored with Martin Nowak and Princeton on the evolution of syntax. The immediate application that I saw was to taking that math and applying it to the origin of complex cells or to multicellular life. There do seem to be...And again this is maybe a tangent, because this is more, again, about sort of informational crisis and message transmission. But, this notion that there reaches a point where each individual word and the memory required to hold all words that are relevant for communication in the population demands more memory than is effective for coherent communication.So, syntax emerges as a way of keeping the collective computation intact at the community level. So, something like this seems to be at play here. Then the question is, can you look at the origin of eukaryotic cells as being driven by energy limitations or the fact that teamwork emerges as a strategy within a resource limitation context?Olivia: Well, I think the question is very complex. It's clear that bacteria and archaea often live together in very intimate associations. It's just that they stay outside each other. So, you'll have a cell with many other cells attached to it. Often those other cells are doing a very important job.So, if you're a small cell giving off, say, hydrogen gas, you can drown in your own waste products even if the hydrogen gas is only a sort of small envelope around you that's less than a millimeter thick. But if there are other organisms there that are pulling the hydrogen gas away, then you can continue to produce.So, you have very intimate associations going on in microbial communities already that are dealing, in fact, very effectively with some of these resource limitation questions. I think that the eukaryotic cell does something else. It is an observable fact that in four billion years of evolution, bacteria and archaea have both remained extremely small.In terms of volume, archaea span six orders of magnitude and bacteria span nine, but they're still very, very tiny. Only the very biggest bacteria, which are the by the way outliers, only the very biggest bacteria are visible to the naked eye, the naked human eye.I think what the eukaryotic cell seems to have done is relieved some kind of architectural constraint. Exactly the nature of that constraint is not very clear and disputed. But if you look at the structure of both bacterial and archaeal cells, the internal structure is generally much simpler than in eukaryotes. In particular, they use their external membrane for generating energy. The DNA is not separated from the rest of the cell. So, there's no separation between information and energy in bacterial and archaeal cells in the sense that everything is sloshing around in the same compartment.In particular, they have this external membrane that is generating energy and that cannot be disrupted without critical consequences for the cells. So, even a virus, and obviously bacteria have viruses and so do archaea, but even a virus…So, a virus doesn't go inside a cell. It injects its DNA, or its RNA, but let's say DNA. It injects its DNA into the cell, but it does it very elaborately and with a kind of hypodermic needle that doesn't really disrupt the energetic activities of the membrane.So, it has come to seem to me that what the eukaryotic cell does is it relieves some kind of architectural constraint. Because the mitochondria, which were bacteria once, mitochondria are what's doing the energy generation. So, the energy generation moves from the outside of the cell to the inside of the cell.Once you've done that, it frees up the external membrane to do other things. So, it's only when you have this symbiosis firmly established and these two organisms have fused…I have to say that it's a very complete fusion. I mean, they really have become one. To just sort of say, oh well the mitochondria used to be bacteria is very insufficient to explain what happened or describe what happened. I mean, when you look at how chimeric and mosaic eukaryotic cells are with all kinds of bits from bacteria here, like the membranes are all bacterial. A lot of the DNA processing is archaeal, but in fact even within that there is some bacterial contribution and a lot of bacterial metabolic genes.So, it really, it's a very composite organism that then goes on to evolve its own stuff, obviously. But it's a very composite organism. It seems that this switch from having energy on the outside of the cell to inside of the cell is what actually relaxes some sort of constraint. The nature of that constraint, I think, is still being explored.Michael: So, this issue that you've brought up a couple times here of larger organisms and more abundant energy leading to a diversity of metabolic strategies means ratcheting niche construction, right? So, you say from the point of view of the biosphere, the emergence and diversification of eukaryotes provided a new set of niches for prokaryotes to occupy, which in turn allowed eukaryotes to occupy far wider variety of niches.So, this notion that the microbiome and, at the bacterial level, the proliferation of new food sources is an example of this driver. I'm really curious to hear you go into more detail about niche construction and ratcheting biodiversity and how that's driven by these energy expansions.Olivia: So, the way that I've come to think about it is as organisms evolve to use a new energy source and then go on to produce new energy sources, you get two things happen at the same time. You get an expansion of the complexity of ecological interactions, and you get an expansion of the geological impacts on the planet.That comes around in two different ways, the geological impacts. Because on the one hand you have organisms living in a wider variety of places. So, one way to think about it, I think, is that as ecosystems become more complex and diverse you also have an expansion of the habitable area of the Earth.So, this brings me to a sort of pet peeve of mine, which is the idea of habitability. Because I don't think it's very useful to talk about habitability, because the question is, habitable by what? I think when you look at the history of the Earth, you can see that actually the question of “habitable by what” has itself been changing and evolving as these ecological and geological things have been going on together.So, I think when you look at the evolution of animals, for example, you can see that this expands the habitable portion of the Earth in several different ways. First, each animal surface becomes an opportunity for much smaller organisms.Michael: Okay, so the adjacent possible is a great thing to bring up here. Because when I think about this, again, in terms of the idea whose time has come, it gets to, in design terms, the affordances of the built environment. One of the things I love about your articulation here, your synthesis, is that it sort of democratizes the so-called Anthropocene. It makes it a process that has been continuous with this greater process of niche construction that's been going on for four billion years.The elephant in the room is [James] Lovelock and Gaia, right? And this notion that life creates the conditions for life. There's something really beautiful about showing that there are ways that human beings are distinct. You talked about this last night, our capacity to reflect on these things is an important qualitative difference.But at the same time, looking at the Great Oxidation Event, for example, as an atmospheric or climate catastrophe that required an innovative response, the pioneering of new metabolisms on this planet, casts our current climate crisis as a consequence of the industrial revolution in a light that seems to give us some very helpful and concrete analogies for how to create our way out of this accelerating sequence of catastrophes that started way before we started interfering with natural systems in any kind of intentional way.Olivia: I think so. Although the big difference between something like the Great Oxidation Event and today is first of all that it was a very long time in the making. It was 300 million years in the making. And second, so we are operating very, very much faster. I think that that is something very important to bear in mind, because yes we can reflect on it and possibly use it as a way to think about how to move forward, but we shouldn't spend 300 million years thinking about it. [Laughs.]We should really be thinking about it right now and in some detail and vigor. Because I think that one of the biggest differences between what's happening today and what's happening in the past is the speed at which it's happening and the number of dimensions on which it's happening.I think that that makes the current situation much more dangerous. Also, another big difference is at the time of the Great Oxidation Event, Earth was only home to bacteria and archaea, which exist as very small life forms in very large numbers, and that gives them a resilience that we do not have.You can imagine just the glaciations of the recent periods, you can see that that is more difficult for larger organisms to deal with than it is for smaller organisms I think. And I think that if we cause a major climate catastrophe, well, it may not be a problem for the bacteria, but it may well be a big problem for us.Michael: Yeah. Important considerations. It seems like it's important for us to backtrack just a little bit here and put this all in context, because your fifth and most recent energy innovation is fire. I've always thought of fire as something that has always been around. It's one of the four elements. That's such a common way of thinking.But something really beautiful in what you've done is give us a step wise layered walkthrough of how everything that we take for granted now was pioneered at some point in history, was new. All classical music was once contemporary.So, I'd love to hear more about what you've articulated as the three conditions for fire and why it's important for us to understand how rare and special fire on the surface of a planet actually is.Olivia: So, fire has only been here for about the last tenth of the planet's history. That's because to have a fire, you have to have all three conditions met. First you have to have a way to start one, and that's actually fairly easy. You need lightning or stones falling. Actually a lot of the other planets in the solar system have lightning, but they don't have the other two conditions.Those are you have to have enough oxygen to support one. You also have to have something to burn. Enough oxygen to support one is about 16% of the present atmospheric level, and that's actually not reached until almost around the same time that you start having plants on land.Those two things happen more or less together as far as we can tell, because the oxygen may have risen a bit earlier. It's very uncertain the history of atmospheric oxygen. So, you get the Great Oxidation Event, and oxygen appears in the atmosphere for the first time.But the history of atmospheric oxygen after that, probably it remained fairly low until a certain time in the fairly recent past, which means several hundred million years ago when it begins to, again, rise. At the same time, around 400 million years ago, perhaps a little bit earlier, you start getting plants on land. So, then the three things come together, and you start having the possibility of fire.In fact, the fossil record shows that that possibility was immediately met. As soon as you could have fires, you did have fires, and we know this because fire leaves its own fossil trace. It leaves charcoal, and charcoal can tell you a lot about the heat of the fire. It can tell you also about the nature of the ecosystem in which the fire burned.In fact, some of our earliest fossils of flowering plants, which are strangely late to the scene, actually, in terms of evolutionary history…but some of the earliest fossils of flowering plants are in charcoal, preserved in charcoal. So, fire has been around for just the last tenth of the planet's history, but it only becomes available as an energy source for organisms once an organism evolves to use it, and that happens some time around a million years ago, 400,000 years ago when humans began to cook.This is work done by Richard Wrangham, others, that has shown that when you cook food, you are able to... It's a sort of pre-digestion, and you can get more calories from the same food than you would if you ate it raw. So, this has had a huge influence on, for example, if you cook starches, it breaks down the crystals of starch and makes them bioavailable, basically.So, if you're eating lots of root vegetables, often cooking them makes them a lot more palatable and makes a lot more of the materials available to you. A number of people have argued that this is one of the reasons that humans have been able to afford larger brains. It's also one of the consequences of eating cooked food.What Richard Wrangham argues that actually one of consequences is that we have entirely adapted to cooked food. He calls us cocinavores. As evidence for this says that people who are eating an entirely raw food diet find it very difficult to maintain their body weight and also spend enormous amounts of time in food preparation, continually sort of pounding and grinding and blending.But also evolving to eat cooked food, it had evolutionary consequences on human physiology, but it also means that we don't have to spend all day eating, which is what a lot of great apes do. Some people have calculated that if great apes were to have a brain as extensive as the human brain in terms of its energy demands, they would not be able to do anything except eat all day long if they did not have access to cooked food.And so, it's with the ability to use fire for cooking that you start to get another shift in the history of the Earth, I think. Because this very rapidly starts to lead to human social changes, which also then go along with tool use that is based on fire. I would argue that almost all modern human technology has its origins in the technology of fire. In particular, the ability, for example, to smelt iron, which requires a great deal of heat.If you don't have access to that in a controlled way, you simply, you just can't get beyond the Stone Age, basically.Michael: So, in terms of getting beyond the Stone Age, one of the elegant threads tying all of these different disciplines together is in your discussion of how most of the mineral species on this planet now basically only exist because they've been produced in some way by some living process.I remember hearing recently that if you take a broader view of diversity beyond biodiversity and look at the diversity of mineral species that due to material science and industrial manufacture and so on, that we're going through what could be argued as, even as we're thinking of this as the sixth mass extinction, we're proliferating new chemicals and new compounds and new materials and new technologies.So, how do you understand that sort of complex relationship between the growth in biomass, volatility of biodiversity, the ways in which these processes seem to lead to this exponentiation of available parts?Olivia: Well, I think that one of the things that I think could be said as a general thing that with each of these energy expansions, you get an increase in the variety of materials and in particular the variety of elements that organisms are using. So, when eukaryotes appear, they start to use zinc, which is used a bit by Bacteria and Archaea, which first of all, becomes much more available once you have oxygen, but second of all, you actually evolve new ways to use it. I think that the same when you have the evolution of animals you start to also have the evolution of shells, not only on animals but also on small organisms that want to protect themselves from animals.That results, ultimately, in a big draw down of the available silica in the ocean, because it's tied up in animal materials or protist materials. So, you do get this sort of expansion of the elements that organisms are drawing on.I think that one of the things that's happened with the human industrial metabolism, so to speak, is that you have an increasing reach for different kinds of elements. Suddenly, we all want rare earth elements for various industrial uses. So, it's certainly in keeping with this general pattern.I think, though, that there are deep reasons to mourn the loss of biodiversity. I personally find it somewhat strange that we do not appreciate the wonder and beauty of some of the organisms around us more, and that we do not value that intrinsically more. Because we are surrounded by remarkable organisms that have lived and evolved for millions of years. I find this at least as beautiful and impressive as any human structure, often rather more so, actually.So, I think that for me personally I would like us to find a way to be less impactful. Not just biodiversity for biodiversity's sake, but something a bit deeper than that, something a bit more…almost spiritual, I suppose. On some level I have a sort of fantasy of an Institute for Planetary Care that would try to improve the lives of humans but also of non-humans…that would be more attentive to, for example, the extent to which our noises impact other organisms and make life unpleasant for them.Maybe this sounds a bit sort of hokey, but I think there's something deeper there. I wouldn’t like to say so crudely as to suggest that it's a matter of self-preservation to preserve these other organisms as well. But I do think that it will speak very badly of us if we allow them to go, that we just didn't care, and we were too caught up in our own stuff, and too unreflective.Because I think it's one of those things that when it's gone, it will be extremely difficult to get it back. This is really getting off the track a bit, but I personally think that the idea that oh yes, well, we're going to bring back the wooly mammoth by impregnating elephants. I mean, really?Michael: I don't think that sounds hokey at all. I think Nora Bateson talks about warm data, keeping things in context where they can be lived and understood firsthand. I think E.O. Wilson has argued for biophilia as not merely just diversity for diversity's sake, but understanding why we value the beautiful within our own evolutionary context. So, I think there is something really important in terms of situating this entire conversation around the cultivation and/or regeneration of biodiversity as part of this greater synthesis that you've articulated here that as the network collapses, all of the niches collapse and you get cascading extinctions, you get secondary extinctions, extinctions of organisms we don't even realize we depend upon.But there's a sort of disturbing note in all of this which in order to get to I have to bring up this other thing, which is that when I hear this story told it reminds me of research like that being done by John Pepper at the National Cancer Institute on the metabolic theory of cancer and how much like Andreas Wagner has done research on these cryptic mutations that suddenly find a context and suddenly create a bridge between local optima on this fitness landscape. It appears as though the tissues of our bodies are riddled with precancerous mutations that are not actually driving the growth of a tumor and that it's predigesting, if you will, the tissue for this oversupply of energy from whatever it might be, a metabolic dysregulation of some kind, to provide the substrate, the opportunity, for the tumor.So, for the last few weeks since I saw John Pepper speak here, I've been horrified thinking about our great achievement as human beings, the discovery of fire, as an instrument of technology, and realizing that the industrial revolution doesn't seem like it's just some sort of mistake.Even though it is contingent on all of these other path dependent settings, it also seems, like you said, like as soon as it could happen, it did. And it's hard for me not to get out of the head space in which human civilization is essentially functioning within the biosphere as a kind of tumorous growth.Towards the end of your paper, you talk about how the entire Phanerozoic has been characterized by the repeated replacement of low-energy life forms by those able to harness larger amounts of energy. Ectotherms are replaced by endotherms. Not entirely. Gymnosperms are replaced by angiosperms. Again, not entirely. But when I think about this in terms of the work the Geoffrey West has done on scaling laws and cities, and these accelerating returns that we observe in the economy, it seems as though whatever we're in the midst of is a process that is greater than our ability to intervene and that human beings are maybe the gymnosperms or the ectotherms here.That we are participating in the production of massive server farms and other kinds of industrial infrastructure that are making human environments more and more inhospitable for human beings. So, I'm curious where you see the sort of the map of the problem here.Olivia: Well, I think it's very profound. The work that I've been doing thinking about Earth history and thinking about how organisms use energy has certainly changed how I see the world. What I'm about to say is probably going to sound very strange, but I have begun to think of organisms as being servants of energy. That we build things because we have the energy to do it. I think this is true of all organisms. One of the things that I've been very interested by is what happens to cyanobacteria when they are nutrient-limited.So, cyanobacteria are the original organisms that evolved to split water with sunlight to release oxygen. They're extremely abundant. They're probably the world's most important organism, one of the most prolific, one of the most successful in terms of representation in the biosphere. Because you can think about all plants as being a manifestation of cyanobacteria, because the chloroplast which allows plants to use sunlight is derived from cyanobacteria.So, when a cyanobacterium is unable to make proteins because it doesn't have enough access to nitrogen or to phosphorous, it must nevertheless continue to use the energy it has or else it will break down. So, what it then starts doing is it starts making sugar, but it doesn't use the sugar for itself. It just puts it into the environment. It makes the sugar and gets rid of it, makes the sugar and gets rid of it, makes the sugar and gets rid of it.So, you can see this situation where the energy is flowing through the organism, and the organism is building stuff that is of no use to itself. This has consequences for the environment, because lots of other organisms then live on this sugar. So, the cyanobacteria end up creating a community around them of organisms that feed on the sugar.But it has made me think a lot. I started reading some strange and difficult literature in bacteriology which suggests that actually a lot of organisms have a sort of steam valve that they basically let off excess energy by doing one activity or another. I have come to think of organisms as being energetic constructions.We're always breathing. We always have to carry out energetic processes. These are going on all the time, and the energy is first. I mean, people usually say, “Oh yes well organisms need energy in order to grow, reproduce, move, et cetera.” But I think it's the other way around. I think we do those things because the energy is flowing.And what humans have been doing is creating much bigger flows of energy. What do we do with those flows of energy? We build stuff. In fact, energy use has been increasing tremendously. As you say, some of it, especially something like Bitcoin mining, seems to me to be really just kind of putting the sugar into the system and keeping the energy is there. It makes me very pessimistic, because it makes me think that we're on a kind of path where even if we were to switch completely to solar, we would still be needing to use all this energy that we have. That use would still be destructive to the rest of the environment. I think that my only sort of hope in this is that it is possible for us to understand it.If we were to apply ourselves to it properly and to really pull together. I mean, a rowing boat goes much faster when all eight people are rowing at the same speed, you know, and then it really zooms along.Michael: Less waste heat.Olivia: Yeah. So, if we were all to pull together, it's possible that we might be able to really find something new and find a way to escape from being servants of energy. I think it's quite urgent. I'm not sure we'll make it. I think that we may be about to discover the answer to the Fermi Paradox, which is where all the other civilizations. I think we may be about to discover the answer to that, which is that you can't just get out of this energy trap. But I would like to hope that we would live up to the name that Carl Linnaeus gave us when he described us as a biological species, Homo sapiens, rather than Homo stupid-ans. [Laughs.]And that we would be able to really come together. But I think it will take quite an extraordinary cooperative effort, but cooperation is something that humans have evolved to do. Did that sound very strange?Michael: No. Not at all. The figure ground reversal in this, the noun or verb, object or process. This is a very important distinction when we're talking about whether it's appropriate to use continuous or discreet math. When we're talking about the difference in perception between the cultural east and the cultural west and how they parse and landscape, how they understand the relationship of organism to environment.The whole conversation around dissipative structures and free energy minimization has been ongoing within the sciences, at least, for decades. But framing this as order emerges as a way of energy seeking rest…it circumvents this tiresome conversation that won't die around whether life is somehow a fifth law. Or that life requires some sort of vitalist principle or anti-entropic principle. It also brings us back to your mention of the importance of acknowledging grief in this, because as a process it's almost a Heraclitean thing, right? That what exists — to put in philosophical terms right? — that ontologically prior is the flow. Then the forms emerge out of the flow.So, the question of how seeing things in this way situates us with respect to these environmental and social issues: What do we do with extinction? How do we understand our role in the seemingly imminent biotechnological explosion that's about to happen of new kinds of organisms?But I want to go a little deeper with you, while we still have the time for it, about what comes next. Because in a way it's important over geological timescale to compress every energy innovation that humans have made into fire. Right? That would include, presumably, nuclear technologies and so on.It seems that though there's a decent reason... I'm afraid to even bring this up. But let's suggest just as a thought experiment that radically new and liberating forms of energy technology have in fact been suppressed. Is it possible that it's actually to our benefit? That if suddenly we were able to realize the ecological dream of abundant free energy, we would turn the whole planet into paper clips, or something similarly stupid.Olivia: Well, I think that there are several different dimensions to the question. I think that burning fossil fuel has very clear, very detrimental effects. I don't think most people would dispute that. Certainly I don't think scientists would.So, there's an argument for saying, well, we must stop using fossil fuel as soon as we can, because it is so directly disruptive and so quickly disruptive, and we are seeing those effects. But it's certainly not the only effect, right? I mean, there was a paper that was published either last year or this year by a couple of people looking at just the general heating up as a result of entropy causing activities.So, just the use of energy and the fact that the conversion is never complete. It means that heat is always released in anything, and you can see it with microbes, too, that they're generating heat. That's why compost piles are warm. You can put your hand in and it's nice and warm, and snakes like to sleep there because of all the microbial heat production.There are people who have predicted that by 2260 the Earth will have heated up due to energetic uses independently from the carbon dioxide, that it will have heated up and become a bit uncomfortable simply because of the heat that is being generated and that hangs around. I'm not able to really assess this. I'm particularly not able to assess the 2260 figure.Michael: That's very specific.Olivia: But I think that there are very important questions around whether or not we would be able to decide as a civilization to say we want to go to a completely different path. It's pretty obvious that all this stuff doesn't make people happy. So, I think there's a question of could we just do something completely different?I don't know what that would be, and I don't think there's been enough imagining around it. There's a lot of dystopia around climate change. I don't think there's been enough imagining what alternatives are there? Could we step away from this process that we're part of because we can reflect on it and think about it, and choose to do something that is radically different?I really don't know the answer to that, but I would like to think that it's at least possible that we could start to try. I mean, there are other difficult problems as well in the Earth's system at the moment which have been written about lucidly by Tim Lenton and his colleagues about the need to close the material cycles. We are taking materials out of the earth and using them, but we're very poor at keeping them in the system once they've been used. So, we have all this big recycling problem, especially of some of the metals, and so on and so forth. Even something like phosphorous or nitrogen fertilizer. I mean, nitrogen fertilizer, which at least half of us today have thought to be existentially dependent on. In other words, if we were to take it away, half of us would die immediately, because we would not be able to produce crops. Yet our efficiency of using the stuff is very, very poor.So, if we were able to develop ways to use things much more efficiently so that a much higher percentage of the fertilizer applied went to the plant instead of just running off and creating havoc in other ecosystems, we would start to be making a much more efficient usage. At least some of the knock on effects of what we're doing would be somewhat reduced.I think that those are also very important questions to consider. Personally, I would not welcome an enormous unlimited energy source, because I think actually, it would spell D-O-O-M.Michael: To your point about the cyanobacterial production of sugar, there's a clear economic throughline there in terms of the creation of positive externalities. I'm also thinking about when there was a golden period of cathedral building in Europe, 13th century or so, that was due to the local production of wealth. There might be ways for us to make use of abundance without us allocating it toward mindless expansion.Olivia: I think they are very deep questions. I think that also evolution has shaped our brains in certain ways. I think that that gives us blind spots. Just as moths flock to a candle, I think that we, too, have blind spots, and it's very difficult for us to identify them, because it's us. There's nobody watching us. If a dog could speak, maybe they'd be able to say, “Hey you guys really don't notice the obvious stuff here.”So, I think that we have blind spots. I also think that we have tendencies. Certainly the history of humans is very complex and mixed in terms of mixer of corporation on the one hand, very violent aggression on the other. Also towards other organisms. The kind of slaughter of the passenger pigeon just for kind of sport's sake I think suggests a lack of empathy and attention to other organisms.So, the question is can we overcome some of our built in biases and tendencies to try to step away from this drive for I want more, more, more, more, more, more, more?Michael: It's almost like as soon as it became possible, it happened. Right? So, did you think that maybe the answer to the question is an economic answer, in terms of the way that our incentive landscapes are shaped by economic opportunity?Olivia: Well, I think that it would be great for economists to take part in this conversation. I think that it's clear that, left to itself, a free market does not deal properly with pricing of things like pollution. If we were properly paying for things like airplanes, most of us would be on the ground. Because the costs of the pollution are not being factored into the ticket prices. And I think that that's true with many other aspects of our activity. So, the question is could we rearrange the economic pricing so that our incentives are differently aligned.Michael: A couple years ago, there was a TED talk with Vint Cerf and Peter Gabriel and a few others on the interspecies Internet. Which is both, one, really exciting for the possibility of being able to, like you were talking about earlier, understand the perspectives of other creatures. But it also suggests an attempt on the part of the economy to reach into and appropriate that which has been unmeasured and bring it into the fold and turn dolphins and elephants into customers, not just voters.And yet, the whole issue of the need of collective computation — again, looking back through a glass darkly at the origins of endosymbiosis, wondering to what extent we can analogize that to really dense, highly connected, intentional interspecies relationships now. Or whether human beings are like the mitochondria within the Internet, this kind of stuff.We're back in this sort of catch-22 where it seems like the way out of the problem that we've found is to reach into other perspectives, to reach for new opportunities, to the best of the ability that we have been afforded by our energy resources, by our material resources. I don't know. I'm just left with this very darkbright kind of paradoxical thing — which is that, again, economists please join this conversation — to truly account for the full cost of human activity, means to take our quantification, to take our accounting of these cycles and processes and extend it as far as we can to ask questions like, “What is the economic value of one tree in the Amazon?”, to understand that in terms of both its material and energetic flows. And yet in so doing, it just sort of further enclosed ourselves in this runaway chain reaction.Olivia: So, there's a vogue in ecology to talk about ecosystem services. Just sort of say, well you know, bees pollinate crops, and mangrove swamps protect against hurricanes, and so on and so forth. I understand entirely where the motivation comes from to do this, but it also leads to people saying, “Okay, well let's just make little robots that are going to pollinate the crops instead,” which pisses me off, I have to say.I also think that as I said while I understand why people are trying to give an economic value to nature and sort of say, “Well, we're getting all this stuff for free. We should think about the contribution we're actually getting and clean water and so on.” I also think that there is an intrinsic value which is different from trying to put a price on everything.Just in terms of the soothing of the human spirit, so to speak, looking out at a beautiful landscape that there's certainly some data that suggests that if you're surrounded by nature or visions of nature when you're in a hospital bed, you're able to recover better and faster, and that gardening, you inhale bacteria that make you feel good, and that if you go out and work in horticultural-related or an outdoorsy processes, volunteers who do that sort of work are much less likely to be depressed than volunteers who do other kind of volunteering work.So, I think it's important to think about the psychic effect of some of these losses. And that is different from the economic effect, I think. Personally, I would not like a value put on every ant or every bee or every lizard. I would prefer that we arrive at a system of coexistence, even within this difficulty that we have that we are apparently driven to dissipate energy.Michael: So, that is the question, right, which is how do we accept our role as servants of energy, yet give an intrinsic value to the myriad ephemeral forms that it produces?Olivia: Well, I'm not sure we should accept our role as servants of energy. I think we should try to escape.Michael: What would it look like to throw our shoe into this machine? To reject our role in this process?Olivia: It would mean arriving at a very different kind of economics, I think. I'm not sure that that would be a mistake, because I really don't think the...I mean, it's very clear that material comfort makes a difference from abject poverty to basic material comfort. That makes a very big difference in terms of welfare and health and opportunity and happiness.But it's not clear…I know plenty of very wealthy people who are not happy. So, they're very comfortably unhappy, but they're still not happy. So it seems like the economic situation that we've generated doesn't actually seem necessarily in keeping with a lot of aspects of what humans actually like.What do you think? Have I been saying very strange and weird things?Michael: Not to me, but I'm kind of strange weird person. I frankly don't know how they decided to trust me to host this show. I want to bring this back to one of the more important points in this piece. I think it's easy to get lost in arguing about some of these more philosophical dimensions of value and diversity and so on.But you ended your talk, and you end this piece with a sobering reminder that your synthesis is a story of how something can't happen until the conditions are ready for it to happen. So, on a planet we might otherwise consider Earth-like, if the rocks absorb oxygen more than Earth's did, that it may never actually make it onto the next plateau. It may never actually develop the kind of rich land-based ecosystems that we have here that seem a sort of necessary precursor to the next thing.One, we clearly need to reframe how we're thinking about our search for Earth-like worlds. That is really about adding the time dimension and the dynamical systems dimension to this. Understanding that for most of Earth's history it wasn't habitable to human beings.You had a great line in your talk last night about how you would be constantly jetlagged if you took a time machine back four billion years, because the planet was spinning at a different speed. So I'd like to hear you elaborate on that in terms of recognizing the precious uniqueness of the system that we have.All other things, all other abstract questions about where we are in the process and our responsibility to it aside, what do you see as the simplest takeaway from viewing life history in this way?Olivia: I think I've learned two things. The first is that the Earth is not static. So, what the world that we experience is really a life-earth co-production. It has been evolved over very long periods. Everything from the variety of minerals to the oxygen that we breathe in the air and so on. So, I think that it wasn't just sitting here until humans appeared. We emerged out of a very long, ongoing process, and we find the planet beautiful and very comfortable because we emerged at a particular time, and we fit with the environment because of that process.So, that's one thing, but the other is I would be amazed and delighted if we discovered that, for example, Mars has some sort of microbial life living deep within it. It would be so exciting, because we could ask fundamental questions about the nature of life and the origin of life and perhaps understand more things about how life emerged here, and so on and so forth.If we discovered microbes in the oceans of Saturn's moon Enceladus, it would be tremendously exciting. But we don't have to go there to know that even if there is life there, what happened here is fundamentally different. This landscape or this process of evolution and energy and evolution and energy that has resulted in the world we experience, that hasn't happened in those places even if there is something alive.So, it is my belief that if you want to talk about Earth-like planets in terms of a wet rocky world not too far from a star, it looks like there are probably uncountable millions. But if you want to talk about an Earth-like planet in terms of “comfortable for humans,” it's possible that there is only one. We're already here.Michael: Hopefully we're here for awhile. Hopefully we're here long enough to read your book. When is that coming out?Olivia: When I finish it.Michael: Sometime next year, maybe, hopefully?Olivia: I don't know. At my current rate, another 300 million years, but we'll see.Michael: Okay.Olivia: Very patient publisher.Michael: It happened as soon as it could.Olivia: That's right.
8,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Mirta Galesic! It’s a pleasure to be interviewing you for Complexity.Mirta: It's a pleasure to be here. It's a pleasure to be interviewed by you.Michael: So this is a topic I feel of extreme importance, this question of social learning, social decision-making. We're at a point now where reading your work is actually kind of frightening, because it becomes apparent very quickly that the way that we come to decisions, both individually and collectively, seems sort of mismatched with the scale of modern life. And I'm really looking forward to getting into that with you. But first I want to take us back a little bit and invite you to talk about how you became a scientist, and what got you into this kind of research and these kinds of questions in the first place?Mirta: I guess I was always curious as a child and always wanted to ask difficult questions. And I was pestering my parents who are also scientists. They were both scientists with different things, and my parents were chemists. So for them it was…they were like, what I call, like true scientists. They were able to do beautiful experiments with chemicals that were changing colors and when I would ask them something about chemistry, they knew all the answers to that. And they had theories, they had equations, they had models. And so I thought, oh, science is great. It gives us some certainty about life. It answers questions like maybe a scientist as well. But of course, because my parents were chemists, I didn't want to be a chemist. Of course, I wanted to be something as different as possible. And I had this really cool high school teacher in psychology who brought us to Amsterdam for our high school trip.And he was cool. And so I said, I'm going to study psychology. And psychology was really cool in Croatia at the time and you had to pass intelligence tests to get in. And it was really prestigious for some reason. I don't know why. And I wanted to study psychology because I wanted to help people. Somehow in the process I started to feel this kind of empathy myself. Empathy maybe because my brother was a little bit disabled and so I felt that everybody can be given a chance if kind of understood and respected as a person. And so I wanted to be a clinical psychologist. I wanted to help people with problems, especially young people who feel low self esteem or who are drug addicts and so on.But also it turns out that my department of psychology was not clinical at all. It was completely experimental. It was quantitative methods in psychology. It was a lot of math and statistics. And then as I was poor, I started to work in marketing research agencies, inputting data, analyzing data. And so I completely lost the clinical part. I never became a clinical psychologist. And also I realize how difficult it is to actually help people. I really respect people who do that. But I just saw that maybe my path is a little bit different. Maybe when I retire I'll be a clinical psychologist again. But now I kind of learned a lot about how to measure various attitudes that people have, behaviors, how to make models of cognitive processes and social processes, how to test them statistically. And so I became a scientific psychologist, let’s say. During that time while I was studying, the war had started in Croatia. I'm from Croatia.This is one of the six republics of Yugoslavia. And we lived all happily together for my first 16 years of life. And then suddenly all hell broke loose. And that was very interesting for me to see. The whole society changed in a matter of a couple of years from relatively secular, not nationalistic, inclusive…I always say, give us one more generation. We would probably all be atheists and would kind of follow scientific principles. But somehow something happened and within a year people started killing each other because of national religious orientation. Religion came back in a big way. Nationalism came back in a big way. Suddenly everyone was judged by whether they were Croat or Serb. Suddenly it was important whether your grandmother was Catholic or Orthodox. And people became very angry and manipulation of people started on a large scale. So suddenly, until the 90s, I was like any other teenager, we had a lot of American influences. I will listen to everything from The Cure to U2 or whatever. And suddenly all the music stopped in the 1990s. And you just get nationalistic songs on the radio or like for a decade and nationalistic speeches and only one side of the whole Yugoslavian coin was presented to us in Croatia. And the same happened in other republics. And so some people just never recovered. And this division is present until now. So now we are, what is it now? 40 years later, people still kind of hate each other. There is still enormous nationalism. Religion is stronger than ever. And the people are judged by whether they belong — they are one of us or one of them. And it's easy to dismiss everything that anybody has to say. And any reason and any logic, any corruption, anything can be justified if only the person is one of us versus not one of them.And so that's super interesting to me. You know how a society that lives for 40 years in the secular society, the non-national society was careful built for 40 years and then suddenly everything collapses. And so seeing some similar processes to the hell seen in some much stronger democracies. I'm really curious about how this all works and how can I find some certainty that my, or some beauty of quantitative models that my parents had with chemistry, with molecules and crystals? Can I find something like that in human societies? Of course, the first people think about it, the immediate answer is no. Of course not. This is too complex. We cannot model them with a few simple equations. On the other hand, I guess, didn’t we think about everything around us in that way? And gradually we managed to figure out how physics work and we sent a man to the Moon and figuring out many things. And so I'm wondering whether the next frontier could be to figure out a little bit better, at least how we function as a society and what are maybe some simple rules that guide us, that contribute to this enormous transition. So in societies that you see today. So that's what I'm doing here. God, this was a long monologue story.Michael: No, it's good. Don't worry about it. When I spoke to Rajiv Sethi earlier and we talked about his work on stereotyping and I feel like reading your research, his work has been coming up a lot for me as well, that there's this core issue in understanding how something like this Serbo-Croatian conflict can erupt. How, like when Francisco Varela left Chile in 1973 he said, "You could turn on the radio and one station would say it was raining outside and another station would say it was sunny outside.”And what is going on here? How is it that the United States seems to be torn between completely different realities? And something he said, and something that has come up again and again in your work, is the challenge to this traditional idea that the so-called Homo Economicus model of the rational decision maker acting on perfect information, having a sort of unassailable self interest…that we are always acting on imperfect information, that we have these cognitive limits. And so our strategies for making decisions are not ubiquitous. Like everyone kind of settles on their own strategies based on the conditions of their life.But we're all limited by the time and attention and mental resources that we're able to devote to a decision. So I'm really curious now that we're in the meat of this, I would love to start just by talking about one of the papers you coauthored for the Association for Psychological Science on social sampling, and how we have these biases about our own individual social environments. And how that can lead to apparent radically different perspectives on what we would think of as like an objective external reality, and people are seeing it in completely different ways. So could you talk a little bit about that piece?Mirta: Actually, I will disagree with you here a little bit. So what we are kind of claiming is that people are actually pretty good, pretty adapted to their immediate social worlds. We believe after many 10 years of research after this paper…Michael: Seven.Mirta: Oh yeah. After seven years of research of these paper that people actually have a quite a good idea about their friends, family, acquaintances, people that they meet on everyday basis and with whom they need to cooperate with, learn from or avoid, and that they're actually not as biased as traditional social psychology would like us to think.And we see that because when we ask people about their friends, we see that this predicts societal trends quite well. So in one line of research, we asked a national probabilistic sample of people to tell us who their friends are going to vote for. We averaged those things across the national sample and got better prediction of election results than when we ask people about their own behavior, and this would not have happened if people were biased in reporting their friends, they must have told us something that must have given us information that's accurate and that's goes beyond their own behavior in order for that to happen to predict elections better.And by now we saw that in five elections all together in the US 2016 in France, the Netherlands, Sweden and US 2018 and we hope to predict again 2020. You know, so things like that tell us that people actually pretty good in understanding their social circles. And then the apparent biases show up when people are asked to judge people that they don't know so well. So when I'm asked to tell you something about people in another state or another country or people from another socioeconomic cluster which I don't know well, then I am likely to have some biases.But these biases we show can be explained by what I know about my friends. So if you ask me something like that, I would really try to answer your question honestly. And to do that, I will try to recall from my memory everything that I know about my social world. But you know, if I'm surrounded by rich people, like here on the East side of Santa Fe, it could be very difficult to imagine in what poverty people can live in other parts. And so even if I'm trying my best to recall, the most poor per person I know, I might never recall such poverty that actually exists in the world. And when asked about the overall level of income in the US I'm likely to overestimate the overall level.And similarly, if you are poor, who are poor might have problems imagining the wealth of really rich people and they will typically underestimated the wealth of the country. So okay, let me summarize this. So this piece actually suggests that people are not that biased when it comes to judging their immediate friends. They have a lot of useful information about their friends. And pretty accurate. The biases show up when people are asked about other populations that they don't know so well, and they can be mostly explained by the structure of their own personal social networks. The more biased your social networks are, the more biased your estimates will be about the general population. Does that make sense?Michael: Yeah, totally. So there's something in that I found really interesting about this social sampling, which is that as you mentioned, if you happen to be worse off and everyone else is worse off, as is the case with like income for example, then being worse off, you're gonna project your bias into that general population more accurately than if you're better off in some situation for which most of the population is worse off. And that these biases are not all created equal. It has to do with how they stand relative to the broader population.Mirta: So what we show is that these kind of biases of judgements of the broader population can be explained by the structure of social network and not by some cognitive deficits or motivational bias. Some desire to be better than others or some idea that everybody's like me or some cognitive deficits that people cannot, that people are too stupid to understand how other people live. It's really determined by the context of memory — by the content of one's memory, which comes from one social circle.Michael: I may be rushing out ahead here from scientific insight to policy advisement. But it sounds like this gives us a really clear pointer on how to correct for this handicap and that we really ought to be…perhaps when it comes time to make decisions on behalf of everyone, we should really be listening to whomever the oppressed are in that population. We should be really paying attention, for example, to laborers and students and people that are ordinarily, historically, not given a lot of political voice.Mirta: In other, what do we need to do is broader and our social networks, include in our social networks, those people who are typically not there. So the policymakers who are making these important decisions should have, should know as many different people as possible. And we saw in related studies that people who have most of our social circles are also best able to predict societal trends and to understand how the overall population lives and what people want.Michael: In this paper you surveyed the Dutch and I found it really interesting…this isn't just a matter of personal wealth or household wealth or personal income, household income. You looked at the number of conflicts that people are having with their romantic partners. You looked at the number of friends people have. And it starts to get into this other thing, like the friendship paradox, and how again we tend to mis-estimate the life conditions of other people. Like I was surprised to realize just how wrong people were in their estimates of how frequently other people were fighting with their spouses, for example.Mirta: So we deliberately included different characteristics from income and education that are kind of easier to observe, to such less-observable characteristics that people often don't talk about, like conflicts with partner but also the frequency of depression, of pain and these kind of things. And so yes the less something is visible and the less it’s talked about and the more other will people start mis-estimating those. However, we still see that there is some signal there. It's not that people are completely oblivious or that they are only projecting their own frequency of conflict with their own partner.People have some idea they, people are actually smarter than we think. I mean at least some scientists say that our big brains are result have developed because of our need to collaborate with others, and that our social cognition is perhaps the main driver of our intelligence. So it's not unusual to see for me that people are actually good in understanding who they are surrounded with because they need to know a lot about other people to choose the best cooperation partner to choose whom to learn from and who to avoid.Michael: You mentioned in the discussion of this paper, this exact thing: the attunement to one's immediate social network can be considered adaptive. There's this trade-off between the computational cost of understanding the big picture and the ease and the efficiency of just being able to take this local sample. So how do you think about this in terms of the broader questions about the evolution of human cognitive bias? You know, stuff like Dunning Kruger or the Dunbar number, these cases where we have, I mean those are pretty different topics, how do you think about this in terms of...when I think about the broader questions of complex systems science, the evolution of intelligence and this kind of thing. It seems as though there's like a certain laziness to evolution. We talk about free-energy minimization and that kind of thing. And I'm curious just to hear you expound on that.Mirta: This is off-topic, but as a woman with periods, I definitely understand that there are some boundaries that evolution cannot cross, there is still this, “Can’t this be better?” [Laughs.] My impression is that a lot of the story about human cognitive biases comes from imperfect measurement and comes from inadequate understanding of human cognition. I think that you're actually much less biased than the classical cognitive psychology and social psychology, tell us. If you Google cognitive bias, you'll get hundreds and hundreds of biases. Careers were made on these biases, and they're easy to show in certain laboratory experiments in certain constraint conditions.However, once you think into account the complex situation in which we need to operate…once you take into account not only the cognitive process, but also the social network in which you operate, and the sources of information that our cognition operates on, then you see that many of these biases are actually not there. You can reverse them, you can show the opposite, you can completely erase them. For example, in this work on social networks and social judgments, we see that we can have opposite biases. Apparently opposite biases. Depending on the structure of social networks, sometimes we get people to behave as if they're enhancing their own position in the society, sometimes as if they're diminishing their position in society.Sometimes we get biases that look like people think that everybody's like them. And sometimes as if people think that nobody's liked them. And then we show that there is nothing in the mind. It's the same simple cognitive algorithm that sees the environment, and maybe forgets some things, but nothing motivated. Which then interacts with the network structure, and then shows this apparent bias. So I do believe that Kruger-Dunning in particular, such biases, that they're actually product of imperfect measurement and that as we social scientists learn how to better measure human behavior in many different and real world contexts.And as we learn to have better models, models that acknowledge the complex social-cognitive system in which we operate, then many of these bias will actually go away and we'll be able to marvel like biologists do, anthropologists do, to the beauty of human cognition. Everything that we can do and how well-adapted we are actually to our environments. And by doing that, then we will know maybe there's some baseline level of biases that will still remain, for example, like the Dunbar Number, which seems like a logical consequence of the way we lived through millennia and how our brain adapted. But many of these biases would go away. And so once we understand ourselves better, then we will be able also to deal with the remaining biases better and to focus on what's really important and not just completely dismiss any possibility that we can operate in some adaptive way in our world.Michael: Yeah. Linked to that, you had a paper that you coauthored with Daniel Barkoczi in Nature Communications, where you talked about social learning strategies and network structure, which was the last thing I read before this. And I think in some respects, the most nuanced and intricate, in terms of the findings of all of the papers here. This thing about the heuristics that we use to make these decisions. I know that you left this a kind of open question towards the end of this paper, about how different social learning strategies may have evolved to suit different network structures. But I'd like to get to that through this.And ask these questions. Because it sounds to me like it's not as simple as just suggesting that if we were just exposed to enough of the other, whatever that group is, that we would have a better outcome. Because in some of these cases, larger sample numbers actually decrease the performance of the social learning in that network. So could you talk a little bit about this particular research and the findings that you came to? Yeah, really that was whole thing. I could have just started with that. [Laughs.]Mirta: First I should say that the paper was quarterly. But Daniel Barkoczi was my PhD student at the Max Planck Institute, who is awesome and great and all the good ideas are his in his paper. You're completely right. Even if he had the most diverse network of friends and the largest group of friends, we still might fail to understand the broader social environment if we are using inadequate rules to make decisions. If we are very focused on the advice of a particular friend, or if you're following a particular leader…even if we see today, I mean in today's world where we have access to all kinds of information, we can be everyone's friend and learn from anyone. We do tend to still use rules to integrate social information that exclude lsthr parts of this social network.We follow our leaders. zee follow people with trust. We follow our spouse. Snd so we don't profit from all the diversity around us. And that's what the paper is showing in a way, maybe in a more positive way, but it's basically showing this interaction of network structure, and the decision rule that people are using. So when people are following one member of their network, in this case, in this paper investigating the rule “follow the best.” So follow the one who currently has the best solution…that can be good when problems are simple and when there is demonstratively-best solution and always what we should do is to find that that best way to I don't know, make a cake or go from point A to B. But when the problem is actually much is more complex, then this following the one who has the currently best solution can backfire because the whole group, the whole society, can get stuck in what we call a local optimum, or in a solution that seems all right, but actually in the long run it could have been much more improved if we were more open to other ideas.So there is an interaction between the rule that we are using to make decisions and the networks, like how many different diverse opinions are in our network, and the problem we are solving. So kind of more generally this paper talks about the issue of diversity, and I like to question everything in my work, including concepts that we all hold dear and love. Like diversity, everybody loves diversity. We think that it's always should be encouraged. And I'm talking about diversity of opinions, not about of course diversity of visible socio-demographic characteristics, which I always advocate for, and which is certainly important. But the diversity of opinion in the group is sometimes good, sometimes bad.Again, it depends on the task. Sometimes the task is so simple that we should just follow the one who seems to know the area best, who seems to have the best solution, and we will all be better off. Like simple mathematical equations, or finding the shortest way from A to B. But most things in life are more complex than that. There are many ways to bake a cake, or to make a new computer, or to write a scientific paper, or to arrange a political system. So zeroing in on the first solution that seems reasonable, will often lead to a suboptimal overall solution for the society. In work I like to question collective concepts, even those that we hold dear like diversity, and indeed diversity is important in many real life contexts in which we need to solve complex tasks where there are many possible solutions, and many possible ways to go. Then it's really important to surround ourselves with diverse people, to use decision rules that that enables us to open up and to explore many different options. However, there are some situations when the solution is there, it is known. I mean it is easy to know or maybe it's already found and maybe there is no need to see to hear many different opinions about a simple thing like how much is two plus two, what is the shortest distance between A and B. You should just follow the one who seems to have the best solution and oftentimes we'll be better off than discussing about it for a long period of time.In these cases, actually, diversity is not that good. Which brings me to a controversial issue if you want to know, which is like once the society comes to a solution to a longstanding problem, such as, “Is there God?” My Catholic family is now giving up on me in Croatia. Like is there a God or is is anthropogenic climate change happening? There seems to be abundant evidence that this is happening. But somehow in a society that values diversity, we are still inviting people to have opinions about it. And I wonder this is a controversial issue at some point then when we are close to a particular solution, whether some mechanism for reducing diversity actually might be better for the society. So I think there is a delicate balance between more diversity or less diversity depending on the complexity of the problem on how close we are to the solution.Michael: Yeah. So much of this is about I'm reminded of Jessica Flack’s work on collective computation and talks about the difference between an actual ground truth, like “There are 972 beans in that jar,” versus an effective ground truth, like, “We’re all going to drive on the right side of the street because that's what we all agree that we're going to do.” And something that's been coming up a lot is this distinction between the empirical and the social, in terms of the truth, and how sometimes it's not easy to tell which is, which — not to just dart around cavalierly through your papers, but you have this other one with Barkoczi and also Katsikopoulos on how small crowds can outperform large crowds. And it seems like the linchpin there again is about the complexity of the problem. The way that you explain this is that if the problem is simple enough for an expert to get it, then at some point…Mirta: Larger group is better.Michael: Yeah. A larger group is going to converge on an average. But really, really complex problems adding experts just adds noise or adds an energetic overhead, like a cost to this that isn't actually improving the solution. And so these questions of how complex is the situation in that we're actually trying to solve for seems to be the real sort of killer question here.Mirta: Yeah, this is a really crucial question. If you knew in advance whether a problem will be simple or complex or easy or difficult, then we will be able to optimize our networks and our decision rules and always behave in a best way. Unfortunately we don't know there is uncertainty. We never know whether the next day like or oftentimes we don't know whether the next election will be easy or difficult to predict about. Maybe we know for this next one we don't know whether the next, say, job hire it will be an easier difficult decision.So oftentimes we need to have some way of structuring our network and our decision processes that will work in many different situations, in many different circumstances. And I think what is often called a simplistic decision-making, simple heuristics, biased kind of an unsophisticated cognition is actually an attempt of the human cognitive system to find a way to work, to be adaptive in many different situations without knowing in advance what will happen. So you need to find the kind of lowest common denominator in which to work in many situations.And so this paper with Katsikopoulos and Barkoczi shows that when you don't know whether the next task is going to be simple or difficult, it actually is better to make decision in relatively small groups rather than follow this kind of “wisdom of crowds” approach where you want to have as large group as possible, or to fall over a single leader. When you don't know it's best to have a small group somehow the small group…the drawbacks of the large group when the problem is difficult, or of the idiotic leader, somehow cancel out and you get the best performance of across a range of situations.Michael: That sort of begs the other question, who decides who is on that jury, or who decides who's going to be in that that elite panel of tastemakers?Mirta: Well, there is that. So this paper is kind of neat because it shows that you can just select randomly. So let's say that you somehow selected your group of experts, whoever you can profit by making them a bit smaller. [Laughs.] Just fire some of them randomly and you'll be better off in most situations.Michael: So is Congress too big?Mirta: Actually we're looking at this and so, I mean, most of the decisions in Congress are actually made in smaller committees, which are, you know, 20 to 40, sometimes smaller groups, and not the whole, the whole Congress comes out. Only rarely. I mean for a minority of decisions are put in front of the whole Congress.Michael: And then they're just following, there's a second heuristic of like, well, they agree. So we're just going to follow that.Mirta: So that's not my area, but I would guess some, some work at SFI would suggest that it probably happens in stages. You decide something in a smaller group and then representatives of these groups will meet and then make decisions among themselves and so on. So it's scaled. So, I mean, in essence, you’re dealing with relatively small groups at every stage.Michael: The thing that's I'm racking my mind trying to figure out is what the advice is for planetary governance in this. Because the real pain point is we're all exposed to a global set of problems. We're all aware that we are in some way implicated in the burning of the Amazon or, the overfishing of the Pacific. And obviously there are small things that people can do: they can opt out of the consumer lifestyle, etc. But when it comes to these massive global issues and the fact that we don't have random panels deciding on how we're going to handle this, and we don't even have, in most cases, governance at all scales at which governance is even required. You know, I wonder what it would look like, I don't know what the right word for this would be, some sort of Planetary Ecumenical Federation of Whatever. But then what does it just like, are we just going to select people at random from all over the world? I mean, clearly stakeholders ought to be involved.Mirta: So two things. One is that there are different stages of the decision-making process. One is collecting information, and there we could profit from large groups, a lot of diverse information, a lot of diverse experiences. At some point then the second stage comes when a group needs to make a decision whether to go left to right, or go to the Moon or again or to Mars. And so in these cases we show that smaller group can be better and this assumes that this smaller group has collected all possible information about the problem. They are as expert as they can be. So it's not like that they are deciding on, on the assigning randomly or if they're completely ignorant. So if they did not collect any information and they're actually more likely to be wrong than right, in this case, it's actually better to either choose by dictator, just have one person or to have as large a group as possible.But if you have a relatively expert group of people who overall across many different decisions is likely to make better than chance decisions, at least, then a smaller group will be better. So maybe to summarize, so there are two stages of the decision process collecting of information, where we want to collect as much information as possible and to communicate it as many and as many diverse people as possible. And making a decision…when once we collected enough information so that we are kind of pretty confident that at least in the long run we make better than chance decisions, then it pays off statistically as we show in this paper to have smaller groups of decision makers basically randomly selected from everyone who has sufficient expertise about the topic.Michael: So voting is kind of out in this.Mirta: Essentially that's what it shows. So if you have 200 people who studied everything about the world and now they're maybe confident that they will make a little bit better than chance decisions and they need to make 20 decisions about the world, it is actually better that not all 200 vote about each decision but to select smaller groups of them to vote about these decisions and not across the 20 decisions they will achieve better performance.Michael: It's funny, I'm thinking of Michelle Girvan’s community lecture that she gave on reservoir computing and just the notion that you can improve a machine learning system…you can basically keep it, I think I'm drawing this analogy correctly that machine learning has a habit of immediately finding the local optimum and then settling there and missing the bigger picture. And by adding a chaotic system to the machine learning algorithm, just a camera on a bucket of water is enough to add enough chaos into that process. I mean that sounds a lot like the lottery selection.Mirta: This is exactly what is happening there. Definitely the phenomenon that we are describing in this paper has to do with intentional introduction of noise by selecting smaller groups of people.Michael: I want to go back to the Nature Communications paper quickly because you get a little more granular here in terms of how people are making decisions and how in different networks people can emphasize exploration or exploitation. That at the individual level, different types of situations favor you copying the best solution and other situations favor you spending more time to explore and try things out and see for yourself. And I found it really interesting how these different strategies, these different thresholds for exploration and exploitation, compared within simple environments and within complex environments, within very inefficient networks and within efficient networks. And I would love to just unpack that a little bit.Mirta: Actually, this paper was by itself an exploration of one conundrum in the current literature. Some researchers find that people solving complex problems solve them better if they're well connected to each other, if they work in well-connected communities where they constantly communicate. Other researchers find that it's the opposite, that actually solve complex problems better in networks that are not well-connected, where people communicate rarely. So we were wondering, and both of these kinds of findings are published in prestigious journals by prestigious authors. So we were wondering what is the catch? How can this be?And we think that the answer is in the way we integrate information from the group. If you're in a well-connected network, but you're following one or two people that currently seem the best, you're essentially not using the whole information in the network. And so it is as if you are basically in a less-connected network. If you're in a less-connected network, but you are taking care to listen to everyone and to integrate information from everyone, you can actually receive more information than if you're in a well-connected network, but only listening to one person.And so by introducing these decision rules, this cognitive part in this traditionally more machine learning, sociology, computational problem, we were able to show that you can get both effects. So you can be in a well-connected network, but if you listen to one or two people, then you will be actually quite good on complex tasks. But if you're in a well-connected network and you also listen to everyone and integrate information from everyone, you could get stuck, maybe like we are today in this world. We are zooming from one solution to the other. Everything is changing very fast and you can get stuck in something that seems like a good solution, but in the long run is not a good solution. So the studies so far that found the contradictory findings had only two elements. They had task complexity and social network structure. And they find that for complex tasks, either the more connected or less connected network is better and they find both ways.But now introduce the third element. It's the human cognition, the way the information is integrated. And so we see that if people are using a decision rule that integrates the whole information from a less connected network, they solve problems as if they're in a well-connected network and vice versa. People who are in a well-connected but are not using all of the information from it, it’s kind of similar to the situation of the people who are in actually in the less-connected network. And basically by seeing this whole complex social system together — the mind, the network, the task — we can explain these apparent contradictions in the literature.Michael: So that reminds me of two things. One is the recent research by James Evans and his collaborators on innovation and scientific research and how we have a problem right now in science, which is that the institutes are too densely-connected there. They're sharing researchers, they're sharing funding sources. And it's practically an argument for places like SFI where there's a little bit of a monasterial gap. A little bit of isolation to encourage more divergent thinking. There's also in this sort of ongoing landscape metaphor, talking about how different strategies work depending on the efficient or inefficient network reminds me also of like leaving the city where you're surrounded by people and the strategy is, you kind of ignore most everybody…and then going out into the country where everyone may have local network bias where they don't understand the stranger in the same way that you might if you had a greater rate of exposure to a diverse population. But the other thing is the neighborliness of rural communities who are like, “Oh! A visitor.” And they're eager to hear your stories and people spend longer leaning over each other's fences, catching up with each other. And so it seems like that's a really kind of grounded example of how these two strategies are expressed in these environments.Mirta: Yeah. I think you're exactly right. And I think in science work, oftentimes teams will have a Slack or some way of frequently communicating and frequently talking to each other about every little detail of scientific work. And I don't find it so productive because we all have many ideas all the time. And if I share every possible idea with you and you with me, we will often maybe get distracted and we might think that something is a good idea, which if we had just put it a little bit more effort and exploration would see that it's not the best. And then there is something else there. I personally find that my best ideas comes when I'm alone for a long periods of time, not completely isolated.So I need to have contact with others. But that this individual exploration is combined with occasional social exchange and testing ideas across the fence with a neighbor, I think is very important for kind of deeper scientific vote. I think the easier scientific problems, like maybe some everyday lab staff or problems about some statistical analysis of some data, will be certainly faster solved if we have frequent contact. If you work in teams where we will frequently communicate with each other and we kind of work on it together, but more complex problems, more difficult problems I think are best solved when people disperse, spend some time on their own, and occasionally come together to inform each other about their progress. And then go from there.Michael: This actually reminds me also now that you talk about this in this way, you end this paper talking about the combinatorial nature of innovation. And it just sounds to me like what you're talking about is the evolutionary incentive for sexual reproduction. That it makes sense, once you've reached a certain level of organismal complexity, to have “the boys and the girls,” and then to have periodic mixing.Mirta: Oh, that's interesting.Michael: That you're going to get better solutions for moving complex organisms through a complex landscape if you partition strategy like this and then allow it to remix from time to time.Mirta: It sounds very reasonable.Michael: But you bring that up in this paper as a lead into a question about research which at least at the time hadn't been done. I'm curious, if you're willing to speculate into this, you mentioned that there's been very little attention devoted to the coevolution of innovation and the simultaneous diffusion of innovations. And then this gets back to something you brought up earlier in this conversation about why it is that good ideas don't spread, sometimes. Why it is that we see, as you put it, sometimes interventions aimed at changing the social environment while disregarding strategies for social learning don't produce the desired effects.And like I'm used to thinking about this kind of stuff about inefficient networks. This paper addressed has come up in the Santa Fe Institute Facebook group.Mirta: How?Michael: Well, in terms of there was, I forget who it was…you can probably remind me…work done on the spread of disinformation and how they found that highly connected networks sort of prevented the spread of disinformation, but also prevented innovation.And so it's this double edged sword where if…that’s sort of a separate thing, it gets back to the noise issue and the importance of risk in this process. But I'm just thinking about this more broadly. Okay, so we took a poll in the Facebook group recently — I asked people what they thought the most interesting questions that could be asked by complex systems science are. And one of the more popular questions was, “If we even have a good idea, how do we get people to adopt it?” This issue of, how do we work with these diverse strategies and these diverse network structures, because it's becoming increasingly clear that, like the Al Gore crew, these people are leaving the climate thing to ask this other question about the rhetorical failures of the climate movement. And why it is that people's minds aren't getting changed.Mirta: Here's a chance to introduce some studies that are currently working on with my collaborators Tamara van der Does and Gizem Bacaksizlar and Joshua Garland. And it is all about how ideas spread in different social network structures and how network structures by themselves change as a consequence of ideas and the threats that people perceive to be experiencing. So with Tamara van der Does, we are working a lot on how and why people decide to accept or not a new scientific idea, a new scientific belief. And we are looking at beliefs about vaccination and genetically modified food and climate change.And all of them are tightly related to both our semantic networks in the head…so the different values, and other beliefs that we have about issues…and they're related to the social metrics. So with Tamara van der Does, we are looking at how people decide whether to accept or not a new scientific belief. And traditionally science communication focused on providing facts to people. They would isolate the particular belief that people should now have, like that they should vaccinate their children or that anthropogenic climate change is happening. And then they would provide people facts only about that issue, ideally we as scientists like to devoid things of any context. And so we would provide them in a well designed way as a table or as a graph and we would expect people to take that there is a problem. And I think, I mean we are discovering this only now, I think only now that there are two types of scientific beliefs depend on two types of networks.One is our social network and what do we think that other people in our social metrics belief bout this issue? So of course we know that the beliefs about vaccinations tend to be quite homogenous in different social circles. Parents are often surrounded by parents that also have similar opinions about vaccination I'd say. And kind of vaccinating or not vaccinating your children, depending on your social circle can be a reason for ostracism. People could tell you that you're a bad parent and harass you in some way or reduce your opportunities to cooperate, to get a babysitter, to have friends and so on. So being wrong about something might be less costly than losing friends over this issue. Especially when it comes to issues that until relatively recently did not have huge consequences for daily life like climate change. So it's fine to be wrong about climate change as long as you can keep your friends. So is the social metric aspect. But then there's also another kind of network and there's this semantic network and these are all kinds of different values that you have that are surrounding this issue.So, especially climate change famously, and after decades of political manipulation, is tightly related to political ideology. Democrats believe one thing Republicans believe on, I think, well, whereas the issue of climate change should not be related to any political ideology. It's a human-natural phenomenon that that has nothing to do with political ideology. But in our heads, it is related in a way. You cannot be a good Republican if you're believing in anthropogenic climate change. And you can not be a good Democrat if you're not believing in it. Similar way beliefs about vaccinations and about GM food are related to our moral values of fairness. Whether something is natural, whether something is in line with our tradition, whether somebody is profiting over some people without much power, whether we have freedom to decide, and so on. And so changing beliefs about vaccinations for example, or climate change, might actually require to first change other beliefs around that issue so that people can open up and take the scientific fact. Or the fact needs to be packaged in such a way so that it has so that it somehow resonates with other values people have.Michael: That reminds me of George Lakoff’s work on this he talks about how, in his commenting on the Clinton and Trump opposition in 2016, how the Democrats appealed to fact and the Republicans appealed to feeling. And that there is a deeper structure here. And this kind of may be a tangent, but I mean, it speaks to this question about semantic networks and their role in the decision-making and the way that things as subtle as the metaphorical entailment, the connotations of a particular phrase, can shift all of this and the connotations themselves change.Mirta: Definitely because as the way something is said changes, different people that people think of different things, different parts of the semantic network are activated. And so words like “global warming” were often rejected by maybe more Republican leaning people as something that's not happening. So “climate change” was a way to talk about this. Anyhow, so yes, definitely different words will evoke different different other beliefs, which will then make it more or less likely to reconsider an issue.Michael: Do you worry about this issue of ideology and the social value of agreeing with the people around you and of conforming to a collective decision? Or…this is kind of a, I don't know, maybe a feisty question. It's a known problem: politically motivated innumeracy. When we know that people that are exceedingly smart are actually better at lying to themselves in order to conform and are brilliant mathematicians are willing to overlook elemental mathematics in order to meet this. So how do you see this as a problem for the scientific community, in this kind of stuff?Mirta: I mean so first I think that this kind of behavior is actually quite adaptive. I mean, oftentimes it's better to be able to stick with your group than to be correct about some remote truth. So it’s just a fact of life. The, problem for scientists is to reconcile our legitimate needs to study facts and study relationships in nature without a personal bias. So we must devoid our science from our personal context, from our social context, from what our friends think. This is how we achieve good conclusions. But at the same time, this is not how people operate. That's why science is so special. I mean, it needs to be taught over years in schools. It's not, that does not come naturally. And so we need to somehow find a way to also communicate our science while respecting that other people are also thinking about what their friends will think and how this all squares with their need to believe in things like, God or a leader or the sanctity of nature or whatever moral values are important to them. And so I think this is going to be the next challenge for us to learn how to communicate. I mean, advertisers, some politicians are really, really good in that. So they latch on some value that people have and they associate a particular fact that they want people to believe or think with that value. And that works pretty well. From, I don't know, using people's preference for young, beautiful faces to advertise goods, to using people's fear of others to to promote certain political ideas. It works. And maybe rather than shunning it and thinking that you should somehow cure people from it, at least for now, it would be good to better understand human nature and to try to find ways to present scientific facts in a way that that respects this.Michael: So knowing what you know about decision-making and how you as a human being come to your own conclusions about the world, what are your self-assigned handicaps, or modifications to your process, that are keeping you from taking like a Darth Vader turn and just becoming a super politician, rhetorical, extraordinarily viral communicator of inadequately examined conclusions?Mirta: Sometimes I have these thoughts, Oh, maybe I should just use all this and, you know, manipulate people and yeah, I just think it's immoral. I don't know, it's not in line with my personal moral values. I think maybe from my various experiences, I do believe that people should be given a chance, that they should be allowed to develop to the best or their abilities, and that manipulating them for the purpose of my personal gain is just not something that is going to lead to that goal. So in my moral value system, finding a way to allow people to grow and to develop to the best of their personal capacity is something that makes me happy. But if the NSF stops funding me… [Laughs.]Michael: You're going to be an ad boss here before too long. [Laughs.]Mirta: There is another thing given that you know, as a psychologist to kind of like humanity and I think that people are interesting. I had a conversations with some colleagues who are, who are telling me, well you're studying all this, all these different ways that are part of kind of how people can be manipulated. It gives you a powerful weapon. What if it comes to the wrong hands? And this is, I think a very, very important question. I try to often reflect on that, but my answer to that is, I'm a scientist. My goal is to understand how something something works and share this knowledge with as large a part of humanity as possible so that we collectively can know more about ourselves. And so I believe like if the knowledge about our possibilities and failures is public, if everybody knows it, then it will be less likely for someone to exploit it on a large scale.If it's something that's hidden and if you don't know much about it, then people like certain politicians or certain companies could exploit it without people noticing that this is happening. But once we know to what extent and how exactly are the mechanisms in which our social networks influence us, and in which our network or beliefs influences what we are willing to believe next, then we can both avoid manipulation better and also help ourselves grow again. Find ways to surround ourselves with people or in ideas that will best help us grow in the direction we really want to go. Sounds very esoteric, but that's approximately it.Michael: Let's bring this home with something a little bit less esoteric, I love the esoteric but…right? Something grounded, practical and broadly applicable would be…like, we've spent most of this conversation talking about big problems, big issues, problems that really challenge our ability to even gather adequate information at that scale. But most people are living their lives, making their decisions on the basis of these local networks and these decisions are affecting more or less just the people around you. What do you see as the really crucial takeaways from your research about how to actually engage in community decision-making processes at the small scale, like within families, within neighborhoods? What is your advice to community builders in homesteads and villages? And I feel there's a lot of movement of people into these, smaller and more intentional organizations. What's the way to navigate that with grace in this world?Mirta: I mean it's important to know some regularities of human social behavior and especially to understand the interaction of a few elements that are present in most of these human social situations. And it’s, who communicates with whom, how are decisions made (by decree or by majority), and what task are we solving? And just by looking at that — and my work is ridden with kind of simple models of these things — one can actually have a pretty good idea or make some good guesses about how to organize this community to face different problems. So even in families, some decisions are made by discussion and by taking majority vote, others just bear on the sides as they think is best. So somehow people intuitively know these things. And I think in, in communities also sometimes people self organize in ways that is best for different decisions.But sometimes because of tradition or because of the authority of someone or, or some religious belief, sometimes communities fall prey to maybe following too much a certain way of decision-making. Maybe following a local leader or a certain, set of rules rather than being more flexible and adopting to different tasks and purposes. So what seems like a complex social situation might actually be interaction of a few simple things. “I'm exploring the network structure, the rule and the task structure.” And knowing that could help us organize the society. There is another thing that I would like to mention and that’s having some idea of how we assess people maybe because of what we learned throughout our evolutionary history, react to certain things. For example, how react to threat of the unknown or if another group, and that's something that I'm starting with in my work with Gizem Bacaksizlar, and we are looking at how leaders emerge in discussion groups that feel more or less under threat. We are looking, for example, right-wing groups communicating before and after 2016 election and left wing groups. And before the election when everybody thought Hillary Clinton would win, right-wing groups were feeling more under threat and under pressure. They're unsure about their future. After the election was the other way around.Now the left wing groups are feeling more threatened and kind of bewildered. And we see that in the discussions that were being led before and after the election that there are more leaders. The inequality of influence is larger before the election for groups that feel threatened for the right wing groups and after the election in the left wing groups. So it seems like, and this is in line with some other work that we are doing and with some old sorts of psychology findings that when groups are on the thread, they tend to restructure. And this does have some purpose. Because a unified group will be better in most cases in defeating the enemy. So a group that deliberates a lot and has long meetings and nobody agrees will be probably be less effective in defeating, you know, another enemy group, then a group who unifies behind maybe not the best, but currently, the available leader and just does something together. And so it seems that maybe such things still happen and then this has implications for the problems that the group is solving. Because if the group needs to solve a complex problem that they feel under threat and they tend to unify behind the common leader, they could be less successful in solving a complex problem. They could be better in solving a simple problem but they will be less well and less good solving a complex problem and so having some sensibility of how will the group change under threat, when people are afraid, and maybe when they are experiencing other emotions is also something that I think is important, should be considered by these community organizers.Even the best-organized, most diverse group with wonderful, communication channels where everybody cares about each other's feelings…once the group feels under threat, it could evolve into something else, some group of scared individuals that is following a leader that is not taking into account all the available information is being less good in solving a complex issue. And kind of preparing for this, allowing people to differentiate what is actually a threat and what is just the perceived threat, allowing everyone to have the freedom to express themselves in those, these things. To just feel like society might actually help in many situations. So those are those things.Michael: We've probably jumped the shark here at this point. But this is such an interesting thing that you're talking about here because what it sounds like to me is that there is like a meta-level problem here, which is that the more complex the world appears, the more numerous problems that we identify, the more likely we are to feel under threat and the more likely we are to adopt strategies are actually maladaptive.Mirta: Exactly.  That’s exactly it.Michael: So like right now we've got this, the climate issue is creating this situation where people are sort of electing charismatic autocrats against each other. And it all feels very much like a diversion from the kind of discussion that needs to be happening in order to address these issues.Mirta: And it would be actually a reaction that that worked in many times in our history, but is currently not working. And so we as a society, we'll just need to find ways to cope with new realities with faster change, with more uncertainty overall. And without changing into this scared mob that seems to be happening now.Michael: You got any prophylactics for unnecessary fear at the social level?Mirta: Well, our whole relationship with uncertainty will have to change. I think one of the main problems in accepting science is this idea that things should be certain that we should know you have it 100%, whether something is so or so. And oftentimes I think leaders, even scientists tend to present their work in a way that reduces the uncertainty. That the audience proceeds with less uncertainty. So they try to increase the certainty of their findings because something, something that's more certain is more easily accepted. But it seems again another social skill that will all have to adopt, and that's kind of coping with uncertainty, better understanding that nothing will ever be known for sure. And kind of being okay with that, knowing that that just by, if you have some kind of good process in place — like the scientific process — that’s self-correcting and it's kind of unbiased to any particular group that this is probably a good process that will lead us somewhere.Michael: So negative capability, sort of a willingness to not know or willingness to have to revise our conclusion.Mirta: Right. This is I guess also related to trust. Trust that we have some processes and people in place that are looking or are designed to look for our best interests, which is also something that is eroding rapidly it seems.Michael: Well I feel like we've gone full circle now because we're actually back at the point where we're talking about…you didn't use this word, but homophily: the desire to surround yourself with people like you, and how that skews our understanding of the bigger picture. And maybe it sounds like what we're really circling here is that there may be some way to offer…or it may just happen naturally out of necessity…that we find it suddenly crucially useful to intentionally associate with “the other,” to cross the aisle, to reach out to people who think very differently from ourselves because we realize that we're partners in this kind of collective decision-making process.Mirta: I can really agree. I almost see it as a new civic duty that we'll just have to learn. Like we learn to live together without attacking strangers. We learn to obey certain laws. We've all learned certain things that we did not evolve. That are not genetically coming to us. So I think we also need to learn this tolerance for uncertainty and tolerance for another point of view and even reaching out and rather than closing ourselves in our little echo chambers, actively reaching to others and communicating with that, it's not only because we will be smarter, but because of, because they are will make better decisions the moment we'll cut the link to someone, that person also loses and is also closed in their own echo chamber.So we are achieving the opposite of what we want to achieve. We are losing the source of information and we are also not convincing the other side to change their mind. So we will have basically a responsibility to, in this world where it's so easy to choose friends and alienate people, we will we have a responsibility to reach out and to keep the connections open. Otherwise, we will just evolve in a serious of isolated communities.Michael: So do you have a scientific nemesis whose work I should also be reading?Mirta: …Oh!  I see!  [Laughs.]Michael: Anyone that with whom you might violently disagree that I should be studying very carefully, now?Mirta: You know, we psychologists are very humble. We know that don't know anything and at the same time, there is a saying in psychology, which I noticed now in Santa Fe, it's not present in many other communities, that theories are like toothbrushes. Everybody has their own and nobody wants to use anyone's else's. Like you see you laugh. For me that's it. Like I grew up with that statement. It's such a common knowledge in psychology. So everybody has their own personal theory. Everybody knows it's probably not correct. Everybody knows that there are a hundred other equally plausible theories. So I think they kind of all…we don't hate each other. We all disagree with each other, but we are also aware that we don't know much. So there are no big haters in psychology.Michael: But overall it might be useful to your microbiome if you share a toothbrush every once in awhile. Awesome. Mirta, it's been a pleasure to talk to you.Mirta: It was a pleasure to being listened to by you.Michael: If you want to point people to anything in particular beyond this conversation — educational resources or that kind of thing…?Mirta: I didn't advertise a Joshua Garland’s work on counter speech.Michael: Do you want to dive back into that real quick?Mirta: Yeah. This is basically one way of reaching out to the other side. So of course we all experience a lot of this hate online and we are witnessing a lot of hate speech. And the easiest way for us to do is again, to block hate to censor hate and to disconnect from those who have a different opinion. Trying to show them the error of their ways, or maybe empathizing with the victim of hate to help the victim to kind of survive through the process and to keep on fighting. Or maybe just by flooding the conversation with some irrelevant stuff, posting pictures of puppies or something. Many of these techniques: empathizing with the weak team, empathizing with the perpetrator, providing facts, flooding the conversation, have been proposed. And they have been described. We know for example, many of these from the traditional bullying literature, from schools, from workplaces, and now people are starting to think how this could be applied to online communication. But very little about it and it's still very difficult to analyze this because we don't have good methods to analyze the topics of large amount of data online. It's still the natural language processing and all this techniques for classifying speech in hate or counter speech or neutral speech are still developing. And Joshua Garland being the wizard of everything computational, and a fantastic applied mathematician, is developing together with colleagues different algorithms to detect hate speech and counter speech, and to see what actually works. What kind of counter speech the citizens use to best either show the haters the error of their ways, or maybe more likely you know, make them stop. And to support the victims.Michael: I always got myself out of getting my ass kicked in school by responding with complete nonsense.Mirta: Uh huh!  Yeah.  There.  You’re the puppy strategy.Michael: Interesting. Awesome. Well, yeah. Thanks again.Mirta: Thank you.
9,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Melanie Moses, it's a pleasure to join you in the complexity.Melanie: Thanks. It's great to be here.Michael: You have sent me some very interesting papers on what I think is preliminary research to where you spend most of your time these days. But this work is so interesting, and speaks directly to my abiding curiosity in major evolutionary transitions. So I'd like to start by talking about the PNAS paper you co-authored on shifts in metabolic scaling. But actually, before we get into that, I'd like to know a little bit about your background as a scientist and how you got into science?Melanie: Excellent. Well, I have — as many people at the Santa Fe Institute — have probably a rather meandering path to my current place in science. I started with an interest in physics, computer science, and in fact, I think probably my first introduction to science that I was excited about was reading the book Complexity, which I read on the airplane to go to my freshman year in college. So I was sort of influenced…before I chose my major, I had this amazing book describing this interdisciplinary center where people brought together ideas from physics and economics and…I was really excited by that and so I majored in something called symbolic systems, which is an interdisciplinary computer science, philosophy, particularly focused on philosophy of mind and philosophy of language as a way to approach artificial intelligence.Michael: So that's a very different approach — just so I can get this clear in my head – that’s very different from the non-symbolic AI, like machine learning, deep neural networks, right?Melanie: Yes, this is much more traditional AI, good old fashioned AI that has in many circles been sort of supplanted, surpassed by these machine learning approaches. We didn't learn any machine learning in my undergraduate years, which of course, now that's quite useful. But I started studying actually agent-based modeling and robotics as an undergrad and then I worked in computer security for a while and just was not excited by the work I was doing. So I spent a few months living in the rain forest in Costa Rica and decided that I what I really wanted to study was ecology. And so, I switched entirely. In fact, I had not taken a biology class as an undergrad, my last biology class had been in 10th grade.Michael: Oh, wow.Melanie: So I had a bit of work to do. I went to school in the evenings in the summers and things, and picked up some biology and then pursued a pilot biology PhD at UNM, University of New Mexico, right down the road from the Santa Fe Institute, which was on purpose and began working on scaling theory as part of my biology. There was nothing really computational about that original work. It was mathematical biology and theoretical ecology. But that's sort of my entry into the world of complexity research.Michael: I may be jumping ahead of ourselves by just pointing out it's interesting how, in retrospect, it all seems to come together…that all of these different disciplines are now so intricately woven into a single understanding, in what you're doing. And it's funny because when I spoke to Jen Dunne, she got her start in philosophy also…there's something about the, I don't know, the disposition of the kind of person drawn to this vastly synthetic work — you know, the big questions, the deep ones?Melanie: Yeah, I think the real key for me was that living in the forest, was watching trails of ants, often army ants, but other leaf-cutter ants and having worked in network security, just having this sort of idea that networks are everywhere and then you go to the rain forest…right? I was trying to escape that world. I didn't want to work in that world anymore and then I go to the rain forest, and it's full of these ants that are building networks and basically dominating this ecosystem by these dynamic networks. You seem them…the forest floor is moving with these ants everywhere. And, yeah, that connection was very... It was sort of a deep connection that just made me feel like, "Oh, I just can't get away from these networks. I'm going to spend my life investigating questions about networks and I think the symbolic systems approach, which is just the idea that you really can draw from really different disciplines to come to some kind of synthetic understanding."Michael: Well, I want to call the shot for this conversation because your recent work on swarm robotics and ant foraging and T-cells in the immune system…there’s a clear link there, the cyber security and ants and everything. But to get to that, I think it's important, Carl Sagan says, "In order to bake an apple pie from scratch, first you must create the universe." So there is this beautiful portrait of the history of life and its major transitions that comes through in some of your earlier publications. You were just talking about the more straightforward scaling math stuff. And I think that this is where we see the braid, where we see life as a physical process as an energetic process unfolding in time. Yeah, I'd love to dig in, first on this PNAS paper, the DeLong and et al. piece on shifts and metabolic scaling. So could you set the stage a little bit for the thinking about this piece? The history of scaling thought in biology.Melanie: Sure. I'm glad we're starting with this because I do think this is really the place where the implications of scaling become most readily apparent. So the basic concept with the scaling laws that were developed here at SFI by Geoff West and Jim Brown, Brian Enquist, I had the really great pleasure working with them on my PhD, and as a postdoc, really trying to understand these scaling laws, which sort of at their heart are explaining this non-linear relationship between metabolism and mass in plants and animals. So the basic empirical pattern, known for many decades at this point, is that the metabolic rate of an animal is proportional to its mass to the three quarter power. And basically what that means is if you compare an elephant and a mouse, the elephant is a million times bigger, but its metabolism, I'm going to forget the number, it's something like 10,000 times faster, not a million times larger.So bigger animals have, obviously larger energetic needs, but not proportionally so. And the scaling papers that came out of SFI, and really this tremendously influential body of theory, had relied on data that suggested that this went across the tree of life down to bacteria, certainly in plants and animals. But John DeLong had some data that suggested that, in fact, if you look at the smallest bacteria, even unicellular eukaryotes, you don't see the same scaling relationship. And so this started from a mindset that this is a universal pattern. We started to speculate maybe there's something else going on here. What I love about this work is it really is in some sense exceptions that prove a rule.So the explanation for these three quarter power scaling came from the geometry and dynamics of a fractal branching network. And so, you can look outside; there's trees all over; you see fractal branching networks with big trunks that branch into smaller branches. You've got a beautiful fractal branching network in your body, right? Your aorta branching out to capillaries. But that's not true in bacteria. There's no visible fractal branching network. And so really, when we thought about this, we thought, this constraint, this three quarter power constraint, perhaps shouldn't hold in these other cases. And when John went back and he looked at the data that others had collected and his own data, it became apparent that the basic fundamental energetic constraints are different as you go across these evolutionary transitions from bacteria to eukaryotes, things with no nucleus to multicellular plants and animals.Michael: One of the things that I love about this paper is how it makes clear, or at least proposes how it could be the case, that each of these radical reconfigurations of body plan, each major shift in the size of an organism over evolutionary history has been the answer to a crisis in energy distribution. And I always thought about it in terms of information flow, like cohesion. When I got into complexity science, it was through the work that David Krakauer was doing with Martin Nowak at Princeton on the error catastrophe and the emergence of language and how these networks grow in response to error rates as they scale. But there's this other piece, which I love in your work here, about how this is about physical objects and surfaces and volumes and how energy diffuses across membranes. And I'd love to hear you say a little bit more about actually what you found and what you think is going on in these transitions.Melanie: Excellent. So yeah, I'll start by talking about energy. I, too am really fascinated by the scaling of these information systems. And obviously, they are not unrelated, right? Biological systems are energetic and information processing systems. But the energy story, in some sense, is fairly simple. The argument here is that we start with bacteria that have a scaling that essentially suggests that it's superlinear, so that as the bacteria are growing, they are getting essentially more energetically efficient as they grow larger. So that's a neat trick! Certainly you want to max that out so you can see bacteria getting larger and larger over evolutionary time…Michael: And why is that? Why is that happening?Melanie: Well, so there's essentially two benefits to being large. One, you're able to consume more resources, which means you can then put those into reproduction. In the case of bacteria, you can double your population size by consuming more and out competing, potentially, other species that are smaller. But you're also able to consume energy, not just in a total faster rate, but at a sort of per-volume faster rate. So it's just things are getting better and better, faster and faster, as you get larger as bacteria.But there's a limit to that, because all of this energy that the bacteria are using, this has to happen by diffusion, and diffusion is a slow process as volume gets larger, diffusion becomes limiting in that it just is sort of the rate-limiting step. To move things around in a large space eventually becomes untenable. And so it sets up a place where things can no longer become more efficient by getting larger unless they switch design. And so the argument in this paper is that chloroplasts and mitochondria are essentially solving a problem of diffusion. These are organelles, which are now changing an essential surface-area-to-volume problem that a bacteria has. Everything that comes into the bacteria has to come across its membrane. And that's a surface area. But its volume is growing faster than its surface area. So it's got more need for stuff on the inside, and the rate at which stuff can go in and out is slowing relative to that volume on the inside.And so the solution is to create these membrane-bound organelles. So you basically put lots of membrane on the inside. That's a genius answer to the problem. And so it allows cells to get much bigger, but it also has a different scaling constraint. So what we found in the data is that when that transition happens, now the scaling relationship becomes linear rather than superlinear. These membrane-bound organelles are a solution to a problem, but they come with their own constraint. And that's the main message in these evolutionary transitions is each transition is a sort of an evolutionary, almost a technological, solution to a previous problem about how energy can flow. But every technology sort of has its own new set of constraints that it imposes on the organism. And so, it scales up until that really hits a wall and there becomes some other process or technology that gets around that constraint in some way.So with these membrane bound organelles, you still have a diffusion problem, you still have to get things from the outside then to these organelles that are internal. And so this fractal branching network is sort of the solution to that, you now have, basically, a branching pipe going from where, for example, the oxygen can come from the outside into the organism and be distributed really efficiently to these organelles that are inside the cells. And, again, that's a great solution that allows things to get many, many orders of magnitude larger, plants and animals, but it's got its own constraints that as things get bigger and bigger, they're slightly less efficient. They can't run at the same speed as a smaller things. And so this is just sort of putting these transitions that are already known into this sort of energetic explanation for why we see these transitions in the places that we do and the sizes that we see.Michael: I'm reminded, to call back to my conversation with Luis Bettencourt, and we were talking about slums, and how do you fix slums? How do you get services into these places, and it was all about mapping them and finding where to cut into these blocks, where there's no infrastructure. There's no streets or piping or anything. And it's the same question. It's the same issue of how do we diffuse resources into these areas and clean out the waste from these spots. That's one thing. And then the other thing that you mention in your paper is that each of these evolutionary transitions apparently coincided with major increases in the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere and oceans.When I was talking to Olivia Judson, about her work on major energetic transitions in life, there was this question that she was holding that I feel like you just answered, which is “why endosymbiosis,” like, “why bacteria drawing other bacteria inside themselves,” because they're all of these other instances where there's deep and intimate symbiosis, but not where one organism has literally become a component inside the other. And it seems as though the oxygen as a metabolic byproduct has sort of created this. And then now there's also talk about how it may have been diffused oxygen that prepared the world or enabled the Cambrian Explosion and that radical diversification. So I don't know where I'm going with that, but there's lots of cool stuff that branches off of this understanding.Melanie: Yeah, and I think this is why this is such a core idea in complexity — it’s most obvious when you think about a circulatory network — it's solving this problem that once you've created this complex system, it's full of lots of parts. To some extent, it's tightly or loosely bounds depending on the system, but once you've got this collection of things that have to work together in some way, you need to allocate some infrastructure to allow that to happen. So in the slums, that’s sort of Luis’ point, is that there's no space for the infrastructure. And that infrastructure is really key. There's resources you have to move in and waste you have to move out and that is a feature of any complex system. Evolved, engineered, it doesn't matter. You've got heat byproducts and waste byproducts, and you've got to have networks to move them out.And the circulatory system, the branching patterns that we see in computer chips, the branching of trees, those are all examples of sort of how resources can be moved through space. And so I think this is, yeah, you raise this point about the volumes and space being so important here. Because in all of these biological and engineered systems, there really are physical things that have to move through space, and a network that makes that efficient becomes sort of an evolutionary imperative.Michael: So my question for you is: I look at this, and I think a lot about what comes after. And both in this piece, and the next piece I want to discuss with you, that you wrote about scaling work…in both, you cast a glance forward into the next crisis and its resolution. Or arguably a recent crisis, because maybe we've already hit some metabolic limit as individual organisms and that's where sociality has come from, and that civilization itself is a response to this. And so I can't help but think about how this curve goes from superlinear, to linear, to sublinear as you reach out into these larger visible organisms. And then draw a dotted line between that and reports that we waste 40% of the food that we generate in society and wondering about... This is perhaps an insanely broad analogical leap…Melanie: That's my favorite. Go for it. [Laughs.]Michael: But the question is, to what extent are the inefficiencies that we see in energy use in production and resource distribution in society, evidence of some sort of sublinear metabolic scaling, and kind of inescapable?Melanie: Okay. Ultimately, my interest in this area was driven by two things, one, I told you that I was fascinated by ants. And the other is, like many people, I'm a little concerned about what we're doing to our world. And we are part of this enormous metabolic system where we're extracting largely fossil fuels out of the ground, moving them across these networks and raising the temperature of our planet among other crises we're creating. Maybe that big crisis is a lot to take on with scaling theory. So let's put that aside for a little while, and understand the scaling properties of social animals. And so that's part of what motivated trying to understand the scaling of ant colonies.That is kind of this next evolutionary to transition is going from bacteria in unicells in plants and animals then to eusocial creatures, ant colonies being one of the best examples of organisms that really are best understood as collective organisms. Actually, when we wrote this paper, there was very little data on the scaling properties of ant colonies. And since then, there have been quite a few papers that have come out. And so in this paper, we kind of speculated…Michael: We're talking about which one?Melanie: Sorry, in the paper on evolutionary transitions.Michael: PNAS?Melanie: The PNAS paper.Michael: Okay.Melanie: So one of the evolutionary transitions in which there's some debate about whether this counts, but most people consider sociality as an evolutionary transition. And so the question there is, well, why do you see that transition? Is there an energetic explanation for it? If you consider a colony, a large colony of ants, which might have 20 million ants in the colony, it has this great advantage that it doesn't have to internally sort of house is it networks. So you can actually have networks that are built of the agents themselves, these ants that are forming paths in the rain forest or out here in the desert. And they don't really have to pay the full cost of sort of maintaining that. They don't maintain all the tissue around that network, and yet they use the network to bring in resources and take out waste.And so it's a nice sort of new technological answer to the fact that networks are essentially less and less efficient as they get larger. So an elephant, for example, has to build a really big network. If the elephant could be as fast as a mouse, it would need an enormous circulatory system. So I sort of imagine this elephant walking around with a giant network on its back, the thing that would pump enough oxygen to its cells, so an elephant cells could run as fast a mouse's cells. So sort of this impossibility, like the network would have to be larger than the elephant itself. So sociality is an answer to that question. You can have a network that's external to the bodies that are being maintained and have all these energetic requirements, if you are much more loosely coupled. And so that's one of the things that we think ant colonies are doing.So in this paper, we speculated that maybe when we look at sociality, we might see a different scaling exponent in say, the metabolic rate of an ant colony versus its size, we might see a different slope than we do for individual animals. And maybe there's this trend, this exponent, we've gone from superlinear, to linear, to this three quarter power, maybe we should see a slightly smaller, an exponent, that you can make bigger colonies, but it gets sort of harder and harder to make a bigger one. Interestingly, the data suggests that the exponent is almost the same, really close to this three quarter. So you put big colonies into a metabolic chamber versus small colonies, and the metabolism of the whole colony is going up at about this three quarter scaling, again, maybe slightly steeper.Michael: So does that mean that given the amount of available oxygen in the atmosphere that the biggest ant colonies have a comparable biomass to the largest elephants or whales?  Or…Melanie: So where do they fit in this?Michael: Yeah.Melanie: Okay, one way to look at this is the biomass of ants is about the same as the biomass of humans. So the two most ecologically successful groups on the planet are social. That's not quite the question you asked, I don't know what the mass of the largest ant colony is, I would imagine it's considerably smaller than the mass of an elephant, but I'm not sure. It depends on what you count, because they have a lot of external…their nest is extremely large and heavy. In fact, there's an image of grass cutters that I frequently like to use, grass cutters in Argentina, so these are colonies of millions of ants. And when you look at the colony, actually, its mass must be greater than that of an elephant because there are people who have excavated this ant colony and there are multiple people walking around inside the cavity left from excavating this ant colony. So it's enormous.Michael: Is that when they're pouring lead down…Melanie: Yeah, they're making these casts of the network structure, actually inside the colony. So it's a good question. I'll have to look up what is the actual mass of those largest colonies.Michael: Well, I mean it just gets to these questions about like the 1950s monster movie trope of the giant insects, and why we don't have dragonflies with a six-foot wingspan anymore. Like, why “The Blob” isn't a thing. We have no reason to fear The Blob. And it feels like our science fiction has grown up and matured into, okay, now we fear swarms.,Melanie: We maybe should fear the swarms.Michael: It's a little easier to suspend your disbelief.Melanie: And certainly, you could never have an ant that was the size and power of an entire 20 million ant colony. Its body design is not designed to support anything near that size. So certainly is showing how you can escape that constraint that way.Michael: I mean, for what it's worth, I do appreciate how when they blow up Ant Man in the Avengers films to the size of an elephant, his movement is comparably slower.Melanie: Slower, yeah, I appreciated that too.Michael: Although, I would imagine he would just sort of… Does his vasculature scale?Melanie: No, he would have a diffusion problem. The insect tracheal system is not designed to scale to that size for sure. [Laughs.]So, yeah, maybe a few liberties there. So to take this back to the original question, in ant colonies, we can see these networks and we can see sort of the advantages, and even show that at least in theory, the advantages are mathematically describable, what's the fractal branching network for foraging and retrieving resources. There was a great paper by by Joon et al., gosh, 15 years ago now, that really looked at that question that you can think of the colony's cardiovascular network is that foraging trail. And then we see the metabolism of these colonies following this similar three quarter power scaling relationship, and we don't really understand why. There's all kinds of interesting hypotheses. One of them actually, one of the best ones is the “lazy ant hypothesis,” which is the way the colony stays on these on this three quarter scaling line is, the bigger it gets, the more lazy ants there are that are just sitting around doing nothing.So there's these measurements that show large colonies have lots of workers that are low metabolism because they're just sitting around doing nothing. Whether there's an analogy to your question about inefficiency in human populations, I am not sure. Do we have more people sitting around doing nothing? It almost feels like the opposite. The more energetically connected our society is the more it generates more and more activity.Michael: Then again, so much of the work now, so much of the activity, at least at the level of an individual human being, is like, “I’m sitting here at my desk,” rather than, “I'm out throwing spears at large animals.” And just the very fact that we're even having a Universal Basic Income discussion in this presidential election cycle is, I think, evidential of something about the decoupling of the world that we're used to, and moving into a cohesive planet-scale framework economically.Melanie: Yeah. So part of the lesson from the ant colonies is that these ants, which are viable organisms that can move around as independent animals, they can't survive without being tapped into the system of their colony that feeds them. In fact, there's a lot of evolutionary mechanisms that keep ants from just eating food when they're out in the world, they have to have it processed by the colony. So they're very tied to this infrastructure. So that changes their behavior, it makes some of them lazy, it changes all sorts of things about how they interact with each other. And I think really a fundamental societal question is, how does being part of this vast economic system, that you and I and everybody else are part of, how does that change our behavior? Have we sort of become ants in the colony? This is sort of the Borg idea, that we've had to change things about our own life history in order to be participating in this huge energetic system that delivers us our food and gas for our cars.The first paper I actually wrote was with Jim Brown. It was in some ways, an analogy that I think doesn't directly hold. But this was a paper that showed that as societies become more consumptive birth rates fall. The demographic transition is a well understood…or well documented phenomenon, not well understood. The argument there is that as you become more energetically consumptive, the system essentially has to have all of its components slow down. Just like the cells of an elephant slow down, people in a more consumptive society sort of have to slow down their reproductive rate. I mean, if you could imagine if we were still having eight to 12 children each that are biologically possible, we've got all these resources in the United States, can you imagine how quickly we would have destroyed the planet if continue a growth trajectory like that? It's impossible.And what's astonishing is that the most important biological imperative is reproduction, right? And we all just voluntarily limit that dramatically when we're in large consumptive societies. And maybe we change a lot of our other behaviors in order to allow the whole system to work.Michael: Yeah, in a way, it's kind of a hopeful portrait that you're painting here, that as we approach what we're thinking of is overpopulation that we adjust, and that it's more of a sigmoidal curve than it is this...Melanie: So it's more optimistic than the continued exponential, super-exponential growth of our population and our energy consumption. It's more optimistic than that. It's not terribly optimistic. So if you do the math and you look at the rate at which we've slowed population growth and how much energy we consume individually to slow that growth, the equilibrium point is billions more people, each of which are vastly more energetically consumptive. So if we continued on the current trends, I mean, our energetic consumption would be orders of magnitude greater than it is now as a planet. And that is clearly not viable. We can't do that. And so it's not clear…there’s not some nice asymptotic continuing-of-the-trends. We can't stay on the trend that we're on.Michael: Certainly, but I mean, we're talking about the membrane of the planet, and the membrane of the carrying capacity…Melanie: Right. Yeah, yeah.Michael: There's the question of, if we're going to look at the bacterial transition into eukaryotic cells for advice, then maybe it's like “underground cities.” You know? We’ve got to add that third dimension, create more membrane surface. Orbital colonies.Melanie: It's interesting. We need ways to pump more of the CO2 out of the Earth's membrane that we currently have. We don't have any way to get it out. Of course, it's not quite the right analogy. This is a system where it's only a problem because this was all locked up and we've discovered it and we pump it back out. But it does point to one other interesting piece of this, which is that, for all of these other transitions, there's been some outside that you can incorporate: multiple cells get together and now they've created some new larger thing. Colonies are great examples of this. Now they've sort of incorporated part of the environment into the colony. Certainly, humans have done that.Once we're at a planetary scale, “outside” — it's hard to kind of conceive about what that is. I mean, you get into science fiction ideas of colonizing other planets, which energetically is also probably not terribly viable. [Laughs.] It’s a really hard boundary. It's a different kind of boundary to think about crossing. The fact that we're doing all of this on a planetary scale…I don't think we have any answers. Scaling theory gives us some ways to think about it, maybe.Michael: Yeah! Well, I want to skip ahead now to a paper that you lead authored in Philosophical Transactions B: “Energy and time determines scaling and biological and computer designs.” Because up to this point, in this conversation, we've been talking about scaling out from the meso to the macro, or from the micro to the meso. I want to talk about how you have paired computer architecture here with biological anatomy and how you're looking at it. You talked about how chips really haven't grown all that much individually. Each chip, it’s kind of a same surface it had 40 years ago. The change has been small enough that you and your co-authors just assume it's constant in this paper.Melanie: A bit of a bold assumption, but yeah.Michael: But for the sake of simplicity, it makes sense. Whereas, what you're looking at is an increasing "vasculature" into the micro scale, a finer and finer carving up of that surface area. Talk about what the differences are in those two systems. It is very easy to draw analogies, but what did you and your co-authors observe as departures from the way that this is handled by machines versus the way that this is handled by biological systems?Melanie: Great. I think the difference is probably the way this is handled by information systems, versus the way that it's handled by energetic systems.Michael: Yeah, not machines.Melanie: Yeah, so, computer chips. So we started by trying to understand whether the scaling theory that talked about moving things through networks also applied to computer chips, how it might be the same and different. It maybe is helpful to start with one of the big, obvious similarities that we kind of came across was that computer chips have a fractal branching network — or some computer chips, for some iterations of chips over a few decades, had fractal branching networks that followed precisely the West et al. fractal branching geometry. So if you took the equations that were really sort of simplifications and idealized equations to describe a circulatory network, they really describe in two dimensions, the network called an H tree, that connected components of a computer chip. It was the thing that allowed fast synchrony on a computer chip. So this H tree would deliver a timing signal through this branching network, the signal would get everywhere at the same time.But it ran into exactly the scaling problem, which is to grow that network to a larger and larger size. You both have to make the main arteries longer and you also have to make them thicker. And so suddenly the chip is all network. It's just a network to deliver timing signals. You don't have room to do any computation. So, that's problematic.Michael: Bureaucracy.Melanie: Bureaucracy. Yeah, so that's exactly it. [Laughs.] These transportation networks, it’s all just infrastructure to move stuff around. All the action happens out in the leaves. And so this bureaucracy becomes hugely burdensome. Interestingly, one of the differences is that computer chips are largely 2D, it's a flat surface and all of the transistors are on one two dimensional plane. The way that engineers came up with to deal with the fact that they needed more network as they put more transistors on the chip is they built up extra layers. So now, I don't know, up to 10 or 13 layers just designed to hold all the wires, essentially, that are connecting the components.So when I talked about the elephant walking around with a network on its back, that's exactly what computer chips do. Because they're in 2D, they have another dimension. They can actually carry a a network on their back. So they don't really have to internalize sort of the cost of networks, the way that a three-dimensional animal has to internalize that. So, that's one difference. But maybe the more interesting difference is that we all kind of know in computing technology, transistors are getting smaller and smaller. They've been getting Moore's Law talks about the way that they've been getting systematically smaller over time. And that means you can have things that are not spatially separated, but you can have more of them.And so again, that changes the geometry of these networks, so that computer chips basically can get bigger and bigger…the power that you can process, the information that you can process on a chip can be linearly related to its size, it doesn't have these diminishing returns of this kind of three quarter scaling relationship that we see in plants and animals. So the elephant-sized computer chip, basically, all the components run as fast as they do on a mouse. And that's kind of part of the explanation for this tremendous increase in computing power that we have. There's a cost you don't have to pay if you're moving bits around on a chip that you do have to pay if you're moving oxygen molecules around in an animal.Michael: So this is an interesting opportunity to look at the continuity of energy processing on the surface of this planet. Where do you stand…? Just to take a step back into the quasi-philosophical, there are people like technologists, Kevin Kelly, who tried to articulate the internet and all of our technological creation as continuous, that draw Moore's Law back into the prehistoric and say that we're looking at this one process and that the industrial revolutions and the deliberation of available energy from the fossil fuel revolution and so on are like what we were talking about earlier in terms of the Great Oxidation Event. We're living through one of these punctuations, and that we can look at the built world as a continuation of the process that we are. It's not something separate in that regard.I'm curious…obviously, metazoan arrival…the evolution of complex animals…created new opportunities, but also new challenges for simpler forms of life. And I wonder if you think that's a fair analogy, and what we're looking forward to in that case.Melanie: Yeah. Yes and no. We're part of a group right now that's writing up something on, essentially whether computing technology is engineered or evolved. And I think you can ask that question about any technology in our energetic system: that's oil pipelines and ships and airplanes and all those things. Are they engineered or are they evolved? And in some sense, clearly, they're engineered. We have specifications. If you look at an airplane, and it's pretty clearly not evolved…Michael: At the human scale.Melanie: ...at the human scale. But then you look at these systems, the way we put things together, and it's very much trial and error and things that don't work and don't integrate with the rest of the system or are left behind. The process that's generating this technology, I think is very similar to evolution and in important ways. Your question is maybe is it is there still something fundamentally different about technology and things we've built?Michael: Or is it simply a matter of scale? Because, especially, I was watching the old Nova documentary on the the X planes, Lockheed versus Boeing coming up with the next fighter. And at that point, which by now is years ago, we were designing our fighter planes with computer assistance. Like you just said, everything we were doing was applying a kind of an evolutionary algorithm to designing the components of something so the process itself was complex, even if the result was merely complicated.Melanie: Right. Yeah, I think that it's an important point. So I think the idea that we are sort of just this continuation of this previous trend is, it's true in one sense, but I do also think there are some fundamental differences and maybe, one way when we look back at trends, when we look at things like Moore's Law, there is a sense in which it is very optimistic. It is a particular case. There are very few other things where things have just doubled in power every couple of years. Luckily, solar panels seem to be…photovoltaic efficiency and cost and those things seem to be following a Moore-like trend. So that's, I think, the one tiny bit of hope I see for our energetic future.I wrote a paper that pointed to that, and a lot of people said, "You know what, that's not going to solve the problem, we're not going to have a solar powered society.” It’s not going to solve the problem. But it's a little piece of optimism that some technologies follow this kind of more like trend. You can look back at vacuum tubes back hundreds of years and you'll see Moore-like trends. The vast majority of our technological innovations are actually pretty slow. And there are these moments where we just we figured out how to get oil out of the ground, and that created a huge shift, but the efficiency with which we've gotten oil out of the ground hasn't followed any kind of Moore-like process. It's extremely rare and understanding…Doyne Farmer does some work trying to understand when you get this kind of more like efficiency and when you don't, it seems like figuring out how to get more of that is a really important thing for us to do right now.So there are particular technologies that seem to really rapidly take off. And I think some of those don't really look like evolutionary processes. And there's the sort of punctuated moments in time where we discover how to leverage some resource that we didn't know how to use before. And so we get a big increase in something because of that. That's different in scale, but similar in process, maybe to these other evolutionary transitions.Michael: To kind of depart from this particular conversation, one of the things that I admire about this paper, I think it's the 2016 paper, is how you bring time back into the conversation of scaling. And I'd like to speak to that because you draw a lot on West et al., and the way that they've looked at the actual physical structure, but you and your co-authors make a good point, which is that there are flows going through these systems, and that it's not just about whether the branching vasculature in your body minimizes the waste heat, and the waste diffused oxygen through that membrane, but also that it's really trying to get nutrients into the capillaries as quickly as possible. And as these different sections of the vasculature gets smaller, the diameter gets smaller, and the flow rate has to change. This answers some questions about what we were seeing, the departures we were seeing from that that clean sub-linear mammal scaling curve. And I'd love to hear you say more about that.Melanie: Yeah. So in this paper, we really did try to take two different hypotheses, I guess, about how it is that these fractal branching networks, what they're minimizing. And right, as you said, the West et al. model really said that it's about minimizing energy dissipation, energy waste, essentially the rate. And another argument that it's about maximizing the rate of flow or minimizing time. And so in this paper, we argued that organisms should be doing both. Right? So if you're maximizing your reproductive rate, you need energy to provide to the next generation, and you need to do it quickly. If someone else can do it faster, you're going to lose the evolutionary race.And so when we sort of married those two things, we put both of those constraints into the model, minimizing energy and time. And we assumed that they were equally important based on no knowledge of how we would make any other assumptions. That is an interesting question. Are there places where minimizing energy or minimizing time is more or less important? We said to first brush, we'll assume they're equally important. And yeah, what that did was set up sort of a slightly different optimization that leads to almost three quarter power scaling, but some systematic deviations from three quarter power scaling, which actually match what's been observed in the data.There's this curvature, slight curvature in the scaling relationships, great paper by Kolokotrones and Savage pointed that out. And that scaling, the original scaling model predicts some curvature but in the wrong direction. And this model actually predicts curvature in the correct direction. And it wasn't set up to do that. It was set up to model computer chips.Michael: So you're talking about specifically that the metabolisms of the very smallest and the very largest mammals don't fit the curve?Melanie: The curve. Yeah. They're very slight deviations. But interestingly, one of the results if that's in fact the empirical truth, the scaling exponent you get depends on where you measure on the line because it's not quite a line. So taking this line through different data sets will get you slightly different scaling exponents. I think that if, in fact, there's a little bit of curvature that helps to explain why when people fit lines, they get different numbers. This has practical importance on how we understand these things as well to be able to come up with a theoretical explanation that accounts for the curvature.Michael: There is, in the discussion of this paper, when you go into more detail on evolutionary transitions, you compare the transition to sociality we just discussed with this movement to decentralized architecture in computer networks. And I can't help but think…you talk about, although I don't think you say it by name, the Internet of Things. And the way that we seem to be observing a transition into, and again, you're a swarm roboticist…so it's like this movement into...I like Ricard Solé’s description of solid brains and liquid brains and how an ant hive, or a human city is a sort of a liquid brain. And it looks like our computer architectures are starting to move in this direction, out of the block that sits in front of you, and into this flowing thing.Melanie: Yes, a key question is a question of centralization that a key constraint clearly in these multicellular plants and animals, the network is centralized. There's this big, bureaucratic aorta that everything has to flow through. And that's a problem, right? It causes things to have to slow down. And so you can get around that constraint by, for example, becoming a social organism that doesn't have quite the same centralization, that allows more decentralization and basically, that’s the analogy, right? A thinner aorta, you can function with something without complete centralized flow and we certainly see that in the design of computer chips. There’s not a central place where every bit has to pass through this central location.And yeah, we now have multiple core computer chips, Internet of Things…there is certainly this trend towards decentralization, but I think we need to be careful in saying that that is what leads to a scalable solution. If you look at, for example, Bitcoin, and these kind of trends, their whole setup is trying to avoid centralization. And they're horribly not-scalable. This is why we're pumping so much CO2 into computers in China that are processing, that are doing these mathematical operations in order to verify things without centralization. So with centralization, it's really I think about a balance and an understanding about what needs to be centralized and what should be decentralized in order to have a scalable system.In the swarm robotics domain, our most recent work in that domain is we're trying to build a scalable swarm of robots. So these are robots that might search for resources on the surface of Mars. And we want to imagine sending thousands and thousands of robots to search a really large area. And what you soon run into is, no matter how clever you are with your algorithms for how the robots search for things, their problem becomes all transport. Like, if you're going to take stuff back to the base where the humans are, all of the work becomes robots moving over long distances.And so we were actually able to use scaling theory to say, you know what, we could have independently searching robots that stay in their areas and build a fractal branching network of basically a series of increasingly larger dump trucks. And they can take care of the transportation problem and scaling theory tells us exactly how they can take care of the transportation problem, so the robots out in the hinterlands can keep doing their things as fast as as needed. There's always a depot or a little dump truck for them to put their stuff in connected to the centralized network. So there it's really the balance of how do you keep independent units operating as independently as possible, but connected to a larger system that's taking care of the coordination and transportation piece.Michael: So that seems to be the real meta lesson here. If we pull back just a little, and ask the unasked question of why these major evolutionary transitions, these metabolic innovations didn't just replace what came before. To speak to the Bitcoin thing in particular, I remember in 2017 so many people were convinced that decentralized money systems were just going to replace centralized money systems and that decentralized systems of governance were just going to radically outcompete. It was, I think, a misfit mammals-scurrying-under-dinosaurs kind of a story, and yet, mammals and dinosaurs lived together rather harmoniously for like 150 million years. So why was that the case? That story doesn't really work.It sounds to me in this paper, like you're pointing to a robotic ecosystem in which we have... The real answer is to take a look at this from the ecosystem level and look at how these things are occurring, not just within an organism or within an ant-like super organism, but within the entire rain forest, and how those systems all fit together. And that the different sizes of organisms are themselves representative of a kind of modular and mobile vasculature.Melanie: Yeah, I think that's a question we don't know the answer to: is there an equivalent to a metabolic network in an ecosystem. So if you just think about an animal, you can sort of think about, just like our little robots that are doing their thing and get to work in parallel and in complete ignorance of the rest of them. Each of your cells, in some sense is doing that, right? It's doing its own thing. It doesn't need to get a signal from your brain in order to do its work. It's sort of always doing its work. And every now and then it gets a signal that tells it to do something different. But it's that marrying of this centralized thing that keeps them all sort of under control, but also independently doing their own thing.And the same with ants in a colony, they're independently going out, they've all got their individual brains, but they're still connected with this system. The system that connects a collection of different animals in a rain forest is a little bit different. It seems much less centralized. In some sense, there is energy flow, obviously through that system, but it's not cohesive in the same sense as a social animal is and maybe that is part of what allows this coexistence of many different niches. It's a good question whether the difference between an ecosystem and a social animal really could be understood as a difference in sort of how much centralized control there is. There's differentiation in both cases, but really far less in something like a social insect colony than in an ecosystem. So yeah, I don't know, that's worth speculating on.Michael: I think, again, with Luis, I think we got into this about the organism-ecosystem thing. Does it analogize to companies in a city? It seems like companies have this rapid turnover, they die like organisms, and cities persist in a different way that looks more like ecosystems. But anyway, you've given me an hour already. I want to make sure that we get to the NASA Swarmathon before we end this conversation, because here's a really awesome project that you're the Principal Investigator for. Yeah, I mean, you've been bringing the Swarmathon out to InterPlanetary Festival and it's really exciting. And I don't want to talk for you. So yeah.Melanie: Yeah, so the Swarmathon is a project we ran for the last four years. And the idea was that we wanted to build swarms of robots to revolutionize space exploration. And we also wanted to do this as a way to engage particularly minority underrepresented minority students in a really exciting research project. And I think it was really successful. Our last official competition was last year, although we have sort of some spinoff things happening. It was super fun, first of all. We built about 100 robots total. So these are, I don't know, sort of a-foot-and-a-half cubed robots. We were able to design those. We sent kits out to students. We had about 45 teams total who participated in this. Over the four years, we had about 1500 students involved in building these robots, designing algorithms to have these robots go out and forage like ants.They had to find little cubes that we scattered around in arenas, eventually hiding them behind vaguely Martian-looking rocks. And the idea was, one, that students would learn about robotics, particularly autonomous robots. So the idea was that students would upload their code to us, we would pretend we were on Mars with their robots, and they didn't get to change it. And they would have to run through days of different competition rounds. So in the rounds, we would actually change the distribution of how these cubes were out in the world so that the students had to develop algorithms that were not just autonomous but also flexible, so they would work well given sort of different kinds of worlds.We had a fantastic time, it was really exciting to basically crowdsource this question of how should you forage? How should you search for resources in a big space using a swarm of robots? And there was no answer to that question before. We got over the years about 50 different answers to that question. It actually did lead us to some theoretical work that we recently published that showed that of the best algorithms that won this competition, we could demonstrate theoretically which was the most efficient way to search the space in theory, and we could show empirically that theory is often not the right metric to use when you have robots, really — particularly cheap robots built from cheap components running around in a parking lot with variable wind lights and all kinds of other conditions.And so, weirdly, we were able to kind of engage these students. They had a great time lots of them have gone on to get master's degrees and do internships at NASA, so it was successful in that regard, but they really did contribute to advancing the cutting edge of research in this question of how should you search a large space.Michael: Some of your more recent publications have been on…like, you have this one out this year, “Distributed adaptive search in T cells: lessons from ants.” Did the Swarmathon stuff make it into that?Melanie: A little bit. Yeah, the idea that we've really been pursuing here is that search in theory is often different from search in practice. T cells are essentially searching for viruses, pathogens in your body. It's a pretty messy system. They're autonomous agents, and we can think of them just like ants in a colony or robots in a swarm. They're going off, they're searching, they communicate with each other in some cases. Their movement patterns are really important for how quickly did they discover things. But in all three of these cases, the ants, and the T cells, and the robots, noise and error and structural constraints really change what's the right way to search a space.So yeah, we were actually able to start to draw some lessons. Maybe one of the best ones was early on, our first robots were called iAnts. It was an iPod on a robotic platform and they were really cute. They weren't super functional, but they were fun to work with. We wanted an analogy to ant pheromones. So everybody knows you put the food down in the picnic basket, and a trail of ants comes because they're communicating chemically, the location. We didn't have any chemical communication among our robots. We tried, we failed, to have any kind of chemical communication among our robots. So we just used waypoints. We just used abstract notions of where something was in space and the robots would communicate it. If they found something in a good place the other robots could come there.It turned out this was a horrible failure. And the reason was that when you communicate an abstract location, if you're lost, then you just mislead all of the other robots, they go to the wrong spot. So it really drove home the importance of embodied communication, which both T cells and ants have, they actually lay a chemical trail. They can't lay the trail where they are not. It is, by definition in the place where they are. They might make a mistake in deciding this is a good place, but they at least are putting the signal in the right place, and anyone who's following their gradient will get to that same place. So it drove us to really look at, what are the mechanisms that are sort of robust to the error that individual cells or ants are going to make in their search process?Michael: I guess my last question for you would be, how has this research into search changed the way that you search? [Laughs.] How has it changed the way that you handle whether you design for error robustness in your own life?Melanie: So, I’ll turn the question around. I study search processes because I'm very, very bad at finding things. I can't ever find my keys. I can't find the piece of paper where I wrote down the important thing. Yeah, finding things is not a skill I have. So I was hoping to design systems that could do that for me. Yeah, the main thing is I'll do a little advertisement for Tile, the little tiles that you can attach to your keys, because now I have a sound, it's almost like a pheromone that tells me where my important things are. And I'm now completely reliant on that. And I've given up on sort of the usual random search process that I would use to find my keys.Michael: So you're becoming more of a liquid brain?Melanie: Yeah. [Laughs.] Maybe in many bad ways I'm becoming more of a liquid brain. I've also outsourced a lot of my brain to various computer systems. Yeah, that's just one example.Michael: Or the elephant with a huge backpack, and you're vastly less productive now?Melanie: Absolutely, yeah. I don't have to carry it around with me. It's out in the cloud. So that's a help.Michael: Awesome, Melanie, it's been a pleasure talking with you.Melanie: Thank you so much! I really enjoyed it.
10,Episode Details / Transcript David: Today, I'm speaking with Ray Monk on the surprising topic of leadership through a life of philosophy, mathematics, and physics. We're going to tackle how very deep and surprising ideas that are not associated with business life or the economy can still change lives and societies.Ray Monk is a British philosopher. His interests are in the philosophy of mathematics, the history of analytical philosophy and philosophical aspects of biographical writing. He's professor of philosophy at the University of Southampton, and he's also a Miller Scholar and colleague here at Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico.In 2015, he was awarded a fellowship by the Royal Society of Literature, and Ray is here to talk about the biographies of three extraordinary individuals about whom he has written: Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell and Robert Oppenheimer. Each of these individuals is associated with an incredible book. Wittgenstein, The Duty of Genius was published in 1991. Bertrand Russell biography came out in two volumes: The Spirit of Solitude in 1996 and The Ghost of Madness in 2001. His biography of Robert Oppenheimer Inside the Center: The Life of J. Robert Oppenheimer came out in 2012. All of these people were born into privilege of one kind or another. They were all uncompromising. The were all driven. They were difficult to be around but capable of being charming at times and all incredibly consequential. Ray, perhaps start just by telling us a little bit about the three people and perhaps what drew you to them in the first place.Ray Monk: All right. Wittgenstein was born towards the end of the 19th century into a very wealthy family. His father was in the iron and steel industry but he himself went into philosophy, went to Cambridge, studied with Bertrand Russell, and then wrote a book called Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which attempted to solve all the problems of philosophy in one go. He thought he had done that. He gave up philosophy, became a school teacher, then became convinced he hadn't after all solved all the problems of philosophy, went back to Cambridge and developed a completely new approach to philosophical problems which is embodied in his second book which was published posthumously in 1953. He died in 1951. The book is called Philosophical Investigations and is regarded by many philosophers as the most important work of philosophy ever published.Bertrand Russell was born into an aristocratic British family. His grandfather was Queen Victoria's prime minister, Lord John Russell. He eventually inherited the earldom of Lord John Russell. He went to Cambridge to study mathematics but then got interested in philosophy and particular in the project of using philosophy to provide a foundation for mathematics. He published his first attempt of that in 1903 Principles of Mathematics, which laid out the philosophy of this. He then attempted to do it mathematically as it were theorem by theorem in the massive three volume book that was published in 1913 called Principia Mathematica which he co-wrote with his math tutor at Cambridge, Alfred North Whitehead. He then abandoned philosophy in favor of political activism.The First World War of course broke out in 1914. He considered it to be a big mistake and abandoned philosophy in favor of going up and down the country arguing for peace and arguing against the war, and he was judged to have threatened relations with the United States when he published a lecture in which he opposed United States entry into the war. For that, he was imprisoned in 1918 and that experience, it wasn't particularly unpleasant. Bertrand Russell said, "The experience of being imprisoned is much like being on a cruise ship." It did strengthen his resolve and for the rest of his life he dedicated himself to trying to improve the world, as it were, trying to use the techniques that had informed his philosophical writing to present a clearheaded modern view of life in the world which he did throughout the '20s and the '30s.Up until the end of his life in the '60s he was always engaged in attempts to improve society and attempts to prevent war. He did this in the 1930s. He did it again in the 1950s. He was a founding member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and then the much more radical Committee of 100, and the even more radical Bertrand Russell Foundation. Eventually he died in 1970 and his legacy is really he hoped the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation but more generally a view of the world that abandons religion in favor of an attempted scientific outlook that would seek to replace discord with peace.Oppenheimer was born into a very wealthy family. His father was a tailor, made a lot of money in the clothing industry. Oppenheimer himself was born in 1904 in New York City, Riverside Drive overlooking the River Hudson in a fabulously opulent apartment. He was educated at what was essentially a Jewish school, the Ethical Culture School. His father was very involved in the Ethical Culture movement and that informed Oppenheimer's life. One of the themes of Oppenheimer's life is his attempt to be a good citizen for the United States of America and that ethic he got from the Ethical Culture School.He went to Harvard. He became very interested in chemistry. He went to Harvard and, after a year, he became convinced that the real interesting scientific problems were not in chemistry but in physics, and he abandoned chemistry for physics and remarkably started taking graduate level physics courses when he was just a second year undergraduate student. He then wanted to be at the center. My book is called Inside the Center. He always wanted to be at the center of intellectual life and political life which he thought was in Cambridge, England with Ernest Rutherford.He went to Cambridge at the time when quantum mechanics was beginning to be formulated mostly in Germany, and so accordingly he relocated to Germany and was an early contributor to the very exciting developments in quantum mechanics in the 1920s which meant that he was in great demand in America, and he more or less chose his own job, and the job that he chose was a two-part appointment where he was, first of all, at the University of California, Berkeley where he, as it were, created a physics department in his own image and then at Caltech in Pasadena. He divided his year. He would spend six months in Northern California and then migrate to Southern California. He became so charismatic that every time he migrated down south to Pasadena, he took his graduate students with him and they all followed him to Pasadena in order to, so to speak, sit at his feet.The most remarkable thing about Oppenheimer though is that after America entered the Second World War and after Roosevelt was convinced by Einstein and others to pursue the project of using nuclear fission to make a nuclear bomb, Oppenheimer was chosen to be the man in charge of the laboratory in Los Alamos here in New Mexico. The remarkable thing about that, he said he was the last the person that should have been chosen to do this. He wasn't an experimental physicist. He was notoriously a disaster in the laboratory. He never led a laboratory or anything else. On top of all that, he was held to be politically suspect by one of the most important people in America, J. Edgar Hoover, who thought that Oppenheimer was probably a Soviet spy. Despite all that, General Groves insisted on having Oppenheimer in charge of the project which turned out to be exactly the right decision. Oppenheimer led the project to a successful conclusion in a remarkably short space of time. By the end of the war, he had replaced Einstein as the most famous physicist in the United States of America.Then because of his past, so to speak, caught up with him and he alienated very important people in the military and in politics in Washington who conspired against him which led in 1954 at the height of the McCarthyite paranoia about communism to a security hearing which accused Oppenheimer of being a Soviet spy. That accusation wasn't upheld but he did have his security clearance taken away from him, and he was temporarily held in disgrace although in the meantime he'd been appointed director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and he kept that up and, within a fairly short space of time, rehabilitated himself as a famous scientist and went around the country giving talks to audiences of thousands of people.David: You've given us the introduction to three extraordinary people. Today, we're discussing leadership in a very unorthodox way. One thing that I'd like to ask you is firstly about biography itself. Many people I know read books on business, and they read books on leadership, and they read books on organizations, and they also read biographies. They read about Madison, and Jefferson, and Lincoln, and Churchill, so there is something that we all feel can be learned by reading about the specifics of someone's life. I would like you to just give us an insight from a philosophical perspective about what you think a biography is doing that a study of their work could not accomplish.Ray Monk: Yeah. Good. I think, first and foremost, a biography is an attempt to understand a person. Now, the particular people that I have written about have all been intellectuals, two philosophers and a physicist. I think in all three cases understanding the person can be a way into understanding their work. It's not a necessary way into it. I mean, I wouldn't claim that you had to understand Oppenheimer's life in order to understand his physics, but I would say that it's one way into it, and it's not as if the interest of the biography is exhausted by being a way into understanding their work.Understanding an interesting person is a worthwhile activity in itself. One needn't regard biography as such a handmaiden for something else, for philosophy or for physics. We want to understand the people around us. We want to understand ourselves, and I think really at the bottom the interest in biography is tied to that general obligation we all feel to understand ourselves and the people around us. I think it's a facet of particularly gifted or interesting individuals that understanding them helps, so to speak, to understand humanity and, therefore, ourselves.David: Right. These three individuals, and you alluded to this earlier, in addition to leading just intrinsically fascinating, conflicted, productive lives, found themselves as leaders either of movements, of styles of thinking, of organizations with huge political consequences which seemed at odds with their characteristics in their early youth.Ray Monk: I think the most obvious leader is actually Russell. Russell was born to be a leader. His grandfather was prime minister of Great Britain. He had descendants who are actively involved in British politics at a cabinet level or near a cabinet level going back to Tudor times, and he was privately educated by his grandparents. His parents died when he was young. He was brought up by his grandparents. He's brought up in his grandfather's house, and so he knew personally all the people at the top of British politics. They didn't send him to a school because they wanted to, as we would now say, hothouse him, and so he had a succession of private tutors who were all given the job, so to speak, of training the young Bertie to be the next prime minister. I don't think Russell ever quite shook that upbringing. That it was his right almost to play a leading part in British politics and world politics.A journalist who went to interview him in the '50s said that Russell greeted him by saying, "I'm very displeased with India at the moment," as if he personally had a foreign policy. He was born into leadership. Now, he became against the grain, interested in intellectual matters, and there are very few intellectual areas of expertise as rarefied as the philosophy of mathematics, and that's what Russell became interested in, but that was him going against the grain. When he then assumed a leading role in the anti-war movement in the First World War, that was him, so to speak, reverting to type in a way.David: Did they all go against the grain?Ray Monk: Oppenheimer again was brought up to be a good citizen, not necessarily a leader but in any case somebody who, as it were ... It was an expectation from his family and from the Ethical Culture movement and I think also from Harvard. It was an expectation that he, as the product of this very privilege background, should play a role in making society better and making the United States of America better. Now, as it turned out, he, like Russell, became very interested in a rarefied area of intellectual activity. In his case, quantum mechanics. But then again, like Russell, wanted to be involved. In the 1930s, he got involved in politics seeing what was happening in Spain, seeing what was happening in Germany and also seeing the effects of the crash of 1929 and seeing the effects of the crash in the United States were affecting in a very unequal kind of way the poorest members of the society and wanting to do something about that. That's what drove him into left-wing politics.And, then when fission was discovered, he's excited about using fission to make a bomb. The excitement of that was not primarily scientific or technological. It was political. He figured that if Nazi Germany who after all still had Heisenberg, one of the leading physicist in the world. Oppenheimer reasoned we have to get an atomic bomb before Nazi Germany does. That imperative was a moral imperative. It was a political imperative and he figured he was the man for the job and that's where leadership comes into it. That he wanted to assume a leading role and he took his opportunity. He wasn't even considered. When Groves took over control of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer wasn't even considered as one of the contenders to be the head of the project. But, when Groves went to California to meet Ernest Lawrence, Oppenheimer happened to be there. He immediately seized his opportunity to discuss the urgency of this with Groves, and so impressed was Groves that Groves made Oppenheimer leader. Yes, his leadership came through in his determination to influence events.David: Wittgenstein, the least likely leader of the three and yet he has had an extraordinary influence on you and on many philosophers so a different kind of leader. What about him?Ray Monk: Yeah, a very different kind of leader. I think if one wants a model here of leadership, one should think of St. Benedict. In all kinds of ways, there are parallels between St. Benedict and Wittgenstein. The age in which they grew up. St. Benedict was born in Italy immediately after the collapse of the Roman Empire. He could see that collapse all around him. He could see the Goths destroying some of the great Roman cities. He lived at a time of chaos and destruction. St. Benedict's reaction to that was, so to speak, to turn away from the world to live in his famous cave and to try and improve himself. So dedicated was he to that that he drew followers to him and then, in the dark years of the post-empire period, it was St. Benedict's rule that kept Christianity alive.Well, now think of Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein was present at the collapse of the empire in which he grew up, the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His instinct, too, was to renounce, to turn away. He once said to a friend of his ... A friend of his said, "How can I make the world a better place?" Wittgenstein said, "The only way you can make the world a better place is to make yourself a better person." This I think is the Benedictine approach, the same kind of impulse. Now, with regard to leadership, it's a bit like with St. Benedict, too, that Wittgenstein didn't set out to create a school of thought. He didn't set out to lead people but people were drawn to him. They were drawn to him by the fierce integrity that he showed intellectually and personally and so he, so to speak, led by example. Like St. Benedict, he became a leader despite himself just by providing to other people a model of how to think and how to live.David: That's one thing that's really intriguing about all three. I mean, if you look at their work, Russell's early work, famous paper On Denoting. You look at the Tractatus. You look at Oppenheimer's paper on the quantum theory of molecules. There's nothing obvious in those titles that would suggest the role that they would assume later. But, in your work, it's interesting. I think you are drawn to people who somehow combine the very rigorous analytical with this much more expansive policy orientation. I'm just curious what is that magic combination of characteristics?Ray Monk: Yeah, it is interesting, isn't it? The one who was most self-aware of that I think is Bertrand Russell. He once said to somebody, "Look, if you want to be well-respected, if you want to have your views on politics or anything else respected and taken note of, write a completely unintelligible book." He said, "Then you establish yourself as having a prime intellect." Because people look at Principia Mathematica, they think, "Gosh. I don't understand this but what a mind to have produced this." Then Russell felt, well, that gives him license, so to speak, to pronounce on Nazi Germany, or the First World War, or American foreign policy. Sorry, did you...David: No, that's really interesting. It suggest it's something to do with respect, and trust, and legitimacy even though the legitimacy comes from outside of the domain of practice.Ray Monk: Exactly, exactly.David: That's enough to convince other people they're worth listening to.Ray Monk: Exactly. Einstein is another example of this. I haven't written a biography of Einstein, but people used to write to Einstein asking him how they should vote because they figured, "Well, if he's clever enough to come up with the theory of relativity, surely he's clever enough to tell us which is the best presidential candidate to vote for." I think that idea is also present in the leadership aspects of the lives of Russell, Wittgenstein and Oppenheimer. All three acquired a reputation for rigorous analytic thought which then in very different ways but for all three of them then cashed out into, well, now tell us how to live.David: I think it's such an important insight because even if you look at the life of Churchill, Churchill was a historian. Churchill was a writer. That's how he made his money and then you look at more contemporary leaders like Steve Jobs who was fascinated in aesthetics and design. It's intriguing when discussing leadership, the humanistic dimension to accomplishment is almost completely neglected in favor of what look likes a recipe book for how to be effective as opposed to depth first which can then be drawn on.Ray Monk: Yes, that is an interesting aspect of all three of these people that to some extent they had leadership thrust upon them because of the obvious manifest intelligence that they had displayed.David: Let's talk about their characters a little because none of them were easy and that's often the case. I'm curious what were the impressions of those around them? Reading your books where I get most of my insights into three of them, they come across as difficult and rather selfish but oddly stoical at times in strange ways. I'm just curious. Was this necessary for their success or is this something they could have avoided if they had just worked a little harder to be a little bit more emphatic?Ray Monk: Yes. It's a question of what's involved in having charisma, I think. I mean, you don't gain charisma by being likable and adaptable. One approach through life and through getting on with the people around one is to want to be liked, to please other people and so on. It's a feature all three of these people. They very definitely didn't do that. They didn't make their choices. They didn't say what they said, write what they write, do what they did in order to make people like them. That wasn't the point.Now, interestingly, you have to, to some extent, you have to affect other people. You have to inspire devotion in other people and all three of them did it in different ways. Oppenheimer is an interesting example here. When one thinks why was Oppenheimer such a good leader of the Manhattan Project? Well, one thing. He had a very quick intelligence and that was very important because he could go to somebody working on the chemistry of plutonium. He could go to somebody working on fission reactions, people working on the physical design of the bomb or somebody planning laundry facilities for the town of Los Alamos.What all the people ... A lot of the people who worked at Los Alamos had published their memoirs. One recurring theme is that Oppenheimer listened to what they were saying and could understand it very quickly no matter what it was through a wide range of all things. Oppenheimer wasn't a person pleaser in a kind of way but he was a good listener and that was a crucial part of his success, a good listener and somebody who would want to understand other people as opposed, say, to Edward Teller. Edward Teller, great scientist but a flawed individual, and you can't imagine Edward Teller leading the Los Alamos Laboratory because he wouldn't inspire the kind of devotion. He wouldn't inspire the kind of cohesion that Oppenheimer inspired because of his ability to listen and because of his very quick and multifaceted intelligence.Now, Russell is different again because you said that all three of them were difficult and that's true, but with Russell it's an interesting pattern in his difficultness which is this. He was more difficult the closer you were to him. He had four wives. He had three children, grandchildren and so on. The people close to him remember him as being prickly, vain, difficult, but he could go into a room of people and charm them all. He had immense charm. He was very funny. He was very witty. When he led a campaign as he did in the First World War and again in the '50s, the anti-nuclear campaign and the anti-Vietnam War campaign in the '60s, a large part of his leadership was his ability to charm other people.Now, take Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein was brought up with impeccable manners. People who knew the young Wittgenstein comment on what extraordinary manners he had. He was extraordinary courtly person. He would put other people first and he had grace. He had social grace but he made a conscious effort to overcome that so the person remembered in the adult Wittgenstein that's remembered as being difficult, headstrong, argumentative was not his natural personality or the one that he grew up with. It's one that he took great pains to acquire.David: It's very interesting. It's almost as if in your books in their totality you're arriving at a theory of charismatic leadership with very unique elements of rigor and rebellion. But, anyway, one thing I did want to point out as you described in your books is this cost them personally a huge amount. Both Russell was expelled from Trinity for his views on the war. Oppenheimer, of course, you mentioned Teller testified against him, was expelled in the '50s for his opposition to the hydrogen bomb. The elements of personality did actually cost them in very real terms.Ray Monk: Yes. I think it is a part of their leadership qualities because, on the one hand, having the courage of one's convictions as Russell, Oppenheimer and Wittgenstein all had, attracts people to you, and so you're in a position to be a leader, to play that role. But, the other side of that very coin is that you can appear to be obstinate. Oppenheimer is not going to tell the president and the various committees that he sat on what he knows they want to hear, what he knows that they want to hear that, yes, you should go ahead with an accelerated program to produce the hydrogen bomb. He himself is convinced that that would be a calamity, and so he expresses that view knowing full well it's going to annoy the president, the head of the air force, the head of the army, the head of the navy and so on.Yes. You say it's their downfall. What, in Oppenheimer's case, was his downfall was his refusal to tell people what they want to hear. I suppose Wittgenstein, it's not like Oppenheimer and Russell because Wittgenstein didn't lead a public life. He held no public position. He led no public campaign and so the state was indifferent to him. People have sometimes said ... Wittgenstein was gay of course. People have sometimes said with regard to comparing Turing, Alan Turing and Wittgenstein, "Why was Alan Turing persecuted for his homosexuality in a way that Wittgenstein wasn't?" The answer to that of course is that Wittgenstein wasn't vulnerable to that kind of persecution because he wasn't, unlike Turing, a public figure.Wittgenstein wasn't a public figure but is there an element of suffering? Is there a sense in which he suffered for the qualities that made him a leader? I would say yes in a very different way in something like the way that the saints, the Christian saints, suffered. That is to say it's a self-imposed suffering like St. Francis not owning anything. Wittgenstein, too, inherited a vast amount of money, gave it away, lived very simply and to some extent that was a cost. The fact that it was a cost that he was happy to pay but nevertheless I don't think many people would want to live a spartan a life as Wittgenstein lived.David: I want to ask you a little bit about guidance and mentorship. I'm curious to see what you say to this. In a sense, Russell was Wittgenstein's mentor and I was looking for who Russell's and Oppenheimer's were. The only names I could come up with were, in Russell's case, Alfred North Whitehead and, for Oppenheimer, Max Born in Göttingen. I'm just curious who were their heroes? Who were the individuals who impressed their ideas and identities on these three?Ray Monk: Let's take Bertrand Russell. In terms of philosophy, I'd say... In terms of history, not people he met personally, but historically the figure he looked to... Well, two figures, Spinoza and Locke. He always carried around portraits of Spinoza and Locke. Whenever he moved, one of the first things he would do is put up his portraits of Spinoza and Locke above his mantelpiece. Spinoza, of course, is persecuted for what was perceived to be his atheism in Amsterdam. Locke, I think figures for Russell as the embodiment of commonsense, as the embodiment of the kind of man he wanted to be, the kind of philosopher he wanted to be.Now, in terms of living people, William James was a big inspiration for Russell as well as F. H. Bradley, the Oxford philosopher. I think the man he admired above all others is actually Joseph Conrad. He worshiped Joseph Conrad. He gave the name Conrad to both his sons. His first son was John Conrad Russell. His second was Conrad Russell. Why? Because Joseph Conrad was a great writer and a great writer of the kind that Russell wanted to be. He went through a very brief infatuation with D. H. Lawrence because he saw or he thought he saw in D. H. Lawrence the ability to look straight into people. He came to the conclusion that he's wrong about that and that Lawrence actually couldn't look straight into people. He was just nuts. Joseph Conrad he continued to believe could see straight into people and that that's what enabled him to write the Heart of Darkness, and Lord Jim, and all these books that Russell had a very deep admiration for.I think it's to do with understanding people and having the gift to express that understanding in wonderful prose. Russell himself thought... This is one thing they all have in common actually. It's not directly tied to leadership but they all paid great attention to the way they wrote. They were all great stylists. Oppenheimer would write out his public lectures and they're marvelous prose. Russell was one of the great prose stylist since the 20th century, I think. When you look at Wittgenstein's manuscripts, he wrote and rewrote and rewrote again trying to get his thoughts into as distilled form as possible. Wittgenstein's model for this was the aphorist Lichtenberg. He said, "I summed up my attitude of philosophy," he said, "when I said that philosophy ought to be written as if it were poetry."Mentors, in Russell's case, Joseph Conrad. Oppenheimer, yes, Max Born. But, I think more deeply than Max Born, Niels Bohr. Niels Bohr was to Oppenheimer what Joseph Conrad was to Russell, the man he admired above all others. He admired Bohr's intelligence obviously but also his quiet determination to get to the heart of things and also a capacity of Bohr's thought that many people have commented on which is more or less absent in Oppenheimer's, but Oppenheimer had a great admiration for it which was his imagination. Bohr notoriously didn't just look at the formulas. He didn't just apply mathematics. He thought pictorially and this was crucial. Many of the breakthroughs that Niels Bohr made, it was that determination to imagine what's going on. In the case of fission, he imagined the nucleus as like a balloon full of water splodging about, being unstable, wanting at any moment to separate itself. Then the bigger the nucleus, the more like a balloon it is and the more likely it is to pull itself apart. That image was crucial in Bohr's understanding of fission.Then, of course, Bohr was a mentor to Oppenheimer in a different way. That is politically. Bohr came to Los Alamos, didn't contribute to the science, didn't contribute to the technology but did get Oppenheimer to think about what he was doing morally and politically. Bohr said, "On the one hand, this could be the most terrible thing mankind has ever done. On the other hand," Bohr said, "it could be the best thing mankind has ever done because it could produce a weapon so fearful, so powerful that it could put an end to war itself." When Oppenheimer chose to concentrate on politics after the Second World War, it was in that spirit that he went to Washington, in the spirit of Niels Bohr trying to put, as it were, to good use the fearful thing that they had created at Los Alamos.David: Now, in terms of the medium of their influence, Russell was prolific. Many books and he made a lot of money on the book that I first read of his which is The History of Western Philosophy which he probably retired on. Oppenheimer also wrote books, gave lectures and turned those lectures into books. Wittgenstein wrote one and then posthumously a second was published. I'm curious about their conception of their audience and how they would reach them.Ray Monk: Good question. All right. Let's deal with Wittgenstein first. Wittgenstein wrote about his intended audience and what's clear is that his intended audience were not academic philosophers. He once wrote, "May my work be quickly forgotten by the philosophical journalists, the people who publish in philosophical journals." He had an idea of his audience and he wrote in the preface to the Tractatus and in the preface of the Investigations of who he imagined his audience to be. He said he was addressing himself to people who thought through the same problems and this could be anyone. It needn't be a professor of philosophy. It needn't be a student of philosophy. It could be anyone in any walk of life but what was required for Wittgenstein was that they, like Wittgenstein, were consumed with the philosophical questions about logic and language that drove his great work. He did have a conception but it wasn't of a particular profession. It wasn't of a particular type. It was a collection of individuals. He was writing for those individuals who were intellectually and spiritually his kindred spirits.Now, Oppenheimer of course had many different audiences. When he wrote his scientific papers in the '20s, he was writing for rather small collection of people who could understand what he was writing and consciously writing for those and, like academics today, he would send off prints to the people he wanted to read his work and to be influenced by his work. Then in the '30s and '40s, his audience not so much for what he published but personally, '30s, '40s and '50s. He sought to have a personal influence on the people governing the United States of America through discussion, through conversation and through leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory.Now, Russell again had an idea of his audience. He said that his audience for Principia Mathematica turned out to be three people all of whom lived in Texas, he said. He said he only over met three people who had read all three volumes of Principia Mathematica, and they all lived in Texas. Self-consciously his audience for that book was tiny. He wasn't unambitious about it though because he reasoned like this. Look, Kant's Critique of Pure Reason wasn't a bestseller. It was written for a tiny audience and, yet, its influence reverberates through the centuries. That's what Russell wanted to happen with his work on the philosophy of mathematics. That it would be read by small number of people but that its influence would go in waves through the generations.Now, later on in his political work and with his popular philosophy work like History of Western Philosophy, he was deliberately setting out to write for a wide audience. He was very cross when one reviewer said, "Look, this hardly counts as popular work. It's too difficult." Russell's response to that was to entitle his next collection of essays Unpopular Essays. But, he wanted a wide audience because he'd abandoned academic life, and so he was living on his writings, so he needed a wide audience because that was his means of living. Secondly, he wanted to influence people and so he wanted as wide an audience as possible for his work about peace, about social reconstruction, about politics in order to influence those people.Now, Oppenheimer, towards the end of his life, again, like Russell, deliberately wrote for a wide audience because he wanted to get across a vision that he'd inherited from Bohr of complementarity, which in the original usage meant looking at particles, looking at elements of physics as both particles and waves at the same time. They're two ways of looking, complementing one another. In his later work, Oppenheimer used that metaphor for the relationship between the arts, and humanities, and the sciences.Like C. P. Snow in The Two Cultures, Oppenheimer wanted to do his bit to stop the pulling apart of the sciences from the arts and humanities, and so he gave lectures to a wide audience because he wanted to influence that audience and what he wanted to influence them ... The way in which he wanted to influence them was to say, "Look, don't regard science as something that is done apart from society, apart from other ways of understanding ourselves. Look at poetry, literature, art, music and science as all aspects of the same endeavor, complementary aspects of the same endeavor."David: I think it's a very important point about all of these people and most people who we retrospectively admire as great leaders, and that is their engagement across the full spectrum of human activities. In your book, you described Oppenheimer's obsession with the Vedas and reading Sanskrit, and of course Wittgenstein with Rilke, and you've also mentioned Russell with Conrad. What do you think is going on here? What has happened? Why do we not see the deep true value of the artistic enterprise and its influence on everything else that we do?Ray Monk: Yeah. That's very interesting. I think one of the things all three of them have in common is that they're aware of that problem and wanted to do something to address that problem. As for why it is, I mean there's not going to be a single straightforward answer to that. Of course, it's not a single problem either. It's a whole collection of problems to do with the way we're brought up, what we expect of us our sons and our daughters, the way academic life is now structured into specialisms. Let's talk about that aspect of it. Wittgenstein could not have survived in today's academia. It was remarkably prescient of the University of Cambridge, first of all, to make Wittgenstein a research student when he hadn't got the basic education of a research student. Then to make him professor of philosophy when he himself said he'd never read a word of Aristotle.Wittgenstein had a deep abhorrence of academic philosophy but also of the academic life, and I think one reason for that was the tendency of academic life to split things up into specialisms and say, "Look, here's a person who's a great scholar of Joyce. Here's a person who's a nuclear physicist. This person here is a mathematician." Wittgenstein had an interest in physics, in science, in mathematics, in poetry, in everything and the fact that he refused to play the game I think nowadays would mean he just, well, first of all, he wouldn't get published and secondly not being published he wouldn't maintain a position. By today's standards, Wittgenstein would be regarded as non-research active in a British university.David: That's interesting. It's one of the reasons why the Santa Fe Institute exists. Precisely because we realize the value of all of those different current styles of reasoning. Let me just finish with a slightly disconcerting problem which has to do with leadership today. It's hard for me to imagine you writing a biography of our current leaders given the kinds of people that you're attracted to and the depths of their interests and the philosophical framing of their position. Should we despair or could we learn something from the lives of the people you've written about that would inform the next generation of leaders who are making equally difficult decisions?Ray Monk: I hope very much it's the latter. I mean, I certainly personally believe there is much to be learned from the lives of Russell, Oppenheimer and Wittgenstein, not only for myself, but I think our society has much to learn. I think more so now than during their lifetimes because more and more we are in need of bringing together science and the humanities. I love the Santa Fe Institute for that reason. That it pays scant regard to academic boundaries and, in academic life, we need to overcome those boundaries. We need to encourage interdisciplinary work. We need to encourage people to be polymaths. But, in life outside academia also, we could do with people reading more novels, reading more poetry. Our leaders don't read enough and they don't read widely enough. I think if we had people who learned from Oppenheimer, Russell and Wittgenstein, we would have better leaders than we have today.David: Ray Monk, thank you very much.
11,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Well, Matthew Jackson, it's a pleasure to have you on Complexity.Matthew: Thanks, Mike. It's great to be here.Michael: So I just finished reading this spectacular book of yours, the human network, how your social position determines your power, beliefs and behaviors. And I was pleased to discover that in spite of the branding, that this is not some sort of light playful self-help thing.This is really a potent introduction to network science. And so I would just love to go through this book today with you and, have you exposit on some of the core ideas?Matthew: Sure, yes.   Wonderful.Michael: But before we get into that, I'd like to know how you got into the work that you're doing in the first place. How did you become an economist and what drew you into this kind of research?Matthew: It's a winding path, I guess. And a little bit serendipitous, I started out more or less interested in mathematics and then. Branched into economics because it was a place where I could apply a lot of the tools that I was learning in math and eventually got interested in networks more or less by accident.It's having a conversation with a friend about power and trying to understand power, and then starting to read the sociology literature on relationships, and that led us into trying to understand how people acquire powerful positions and what that actually means. And that, that was sort of the starting point.And then that sort of sent me on an Odyssey of trying to understand how social structure impacts behavior.Michael:   Wonderful. Yeah. Towards the end of your first chapter here is on power and influence. And so that seems like the right place to start. You talk about four different kinds of centrality, and I'd love to hear you break those down a little bit for us.Matthew: Sure. I mean, I guess the, the most basic we all think of is just popularity. You know, how many people you connect with and that's very natural. You know, we, we count how many friends we have on Facebook or how many followers you have on Twitter, and that, that gives some idea of a reach of a person and so forth.And that can be very powerful and in marketing certain kinds of things where you just want to get something out quickly and at a fairly shallow level...then once you push a bit deeper than you start thinking about other kinds of ways in which people can be well connected.And so another way that is very important is not just having many friends but having well-connected friends. And that leads to a notion that's sort of somewhat circular in a sense that your influence comes from the influence of your friends and their influence comes from the influence of their friends and so forth.And so you end up with a system, but that begins to bring the network into the picture now, right? Because now I care about not only my direct connections, but my indirect connections and that that kind of influence is something that, you know, I guess probably the best example of, of where that really came up was in Google's Page Rank.So that system is built off of a similar mathematics to this kind of idea of indirect  relationships and influence. And that...I don't know how many people remember when you first started out using search engines, but they were often pretty lousy at the time. And when Google came along, it was just eye opening in terms of how much better it was.And what it actually did was it looked for pages in the internet that were central in this way, not just having lots of connections, but are having well connected connections. And that was sort of a key insight that it had. And you know, you were finding the pages that the most influential pages wanted to find, not just that lots of pages wanted to find, and that really made a huge difference.So that's sort of a second type. And then a third type is one that's often known as is betweenness centrality, which  looks at how well a person is situated as a connector of other groups that might not otherwise have strong connections to each other. And so there's a question of, am I a strong intermediary? Am I somebody who is...sociologists call it brokerage. Am I a broker? Am I a person who is bringing information or important opportunities and access from one group to another so that's another type of important influence that one can have in terms of their position.And then another is just, you know,  it's sort of how, how good am I as a spreader of things. And I've worked on that quite a bit. It's sort of an idea of, "How good am I as a diffuser of information? Can I diffuse information? Well, it is going to spread through the network well? "And that means that I have to have. Some good indirect connections, but it's not sort of an infinite process. It's how well am I connected in terms of my friends of friends and friends of friends of friends, and am I well positioned to get information out and and have people understand it and believe it.Michael: I really like how in this book you explain that reach is sort of this real world midway zone between popularity and the strength of your, or the power of your, connections. That we only have so much pull, you know, as another way of thinking about that, that an idea decays as it spreads through the network and it's  you know, like old news or old bread, that kind of thing.And in that sense, it's curious to imagine what a search engine that adds that time dimension would look like, rather than, you know, the sort of God's eye view that Google has, but like how we're actually witnessing links flowing through these networks.Matthew: Right, right, right. And actually, I think, you know, a lot of times when you think of things, you know, people think of things going viral or spreading, most of the time things die out.But there's a lot of times where they die out in that middle zone, right? It's not that it's getting billions of views, but it's also not getting 10  Things will make it a few hops away and that's a very common situation. And then if you really want to understand, if somebody is getting something out to a reasonably large community that can often just be two or three steps away from them.And then after that, you know, things can, can really start. You know,  time takes over and people, whatever the topic is, it might become stale by the time it starts spreading further. And there's also a noise that comes into this. So we've looked at this, for instance, in, in diffusion about information about microfinance.We did a study in rural India, and tried to understand how people were spreading news about a microfinance opportunity that was coming into villages and the best fit by far in terms of how far things spread was really three steps from the initial people that were informed. And after that it seemed that, you know, either it just died out in terms of people no longer finding it.Interesting to talk about or, you know, it was becoming noisy enough that it wasn't clear what was being communicated anymore. So, you know, word of mouth lasts some distance and then it really starts to decay. And you can look at that decay function and map it out.Michael: Maybe we're cutting ahead of ourselves, but this is related to some discussion later in this book about the diffusion of disease.And, I found it interesting to note. That the rate at which different diseases diffuse has everything to do with host-carrier dependencies.  This gets into, you know, questions about cumulative culture rather than just the cultural half-life that you just mentioned, the forgetting of the network. That storage outside, you know, media-independent. you know, so i   t doesn't require direct transmission and like, something can sit in a hard drive for decades.Matthew: Yeah.Michael: You know, there are interesting ways in which this allows us to research the way that we hold store and act upon knowledge.Matthew: Right. Yeah, and I think it also points to the, there's different kinds of knowledge and often we think about people learning in simple diffusion processes, but some things, it takes a lot of contact and a lot of information has to change hands. So, you know, if it's just awareness of something that's pretty easy, that's really like a simple flu contagion.But if it's something where I really have to learn deeply about something before I'm willing to act. So, you know, in microfinance, it turns out that people already knew a lot about microfinance. They just had to become aware that it was coming to their village. But, you know, we've been working with vaccination programs and trying to convince people to get their children vaccinated.And that's a whole education program. And it depends on who you hear it from and how many times you hear it. And you know, that's a very different dynamic in terms of the, what it takes to convince somebody of something, then, you know, sort of a simple spread. So these things really make a big difference.Michael: We are definitely cutting ahead of ourselves here but I would love to use this opportunity to talk about. The DeGroot dynamics in these kinds of systems and how news bounces around  and you know how we end up misestimating consensus in this kind of thing.  It was a very fascinating piece of the book for me. Anyway, I'd love to hear you talk about that.Matthew: Sure. Yeah. Morris DeGroot is a statistician. He built a very simple model where the way in which you modeled people learning was, you know, repeatedly talking to people. So I talk to my friends and then I hear what they have to say, and. You can think of people as just counters in the sense that I hear different things.Maybe it's something about a new movie, and I'll hear what each person's opinion is about this new movie, and I'll tend to just average those, right? So if I hear something from five people that this is really great, that I think, wow, that's five pieces of information that, you know, make it sound like this is really great.This sort of bouncing around that you're talking about could be that, you know, maybe my five friends who all say this is a great movie, all read the same review or all talked to the, you know, the same other person. And we're just natural counters and it's very difficult for us to put a proper weight on these things.And so, you know, we can be hearing things, these sort of echoes through the network and that can help reinforce an idea and it then takes root in us and hearing things enough times makes a big difference.Michael: Yeah. Specifically, talking about the ways that information doubles and echoes in these networks reminded me of the conversation I had with Rajiv Sethi about stereotyping and attentional bias.Cause you know, it's so funny. You talk about how a DeGroot learning model is a kind of scary accurate model for the way that human news travels... We'd like to give ourselves more credit than this, but our working memory, our attention, the algorithms that seem to be at work in human social learning are actually remarkably simple, and from a network point of view, are actually a lot simpler than we experience ourselves to be.Matthew: Right. Yeah. And it's actually interesting because I think. One thing , I did some work on studying net model with, with Ben Golub. And one thing that we found was, you know, in a world, so if you have a network that's really well balanced, so imagine everybody has 10 friends and they all have 10 friends and everything's really well balanced, it can be that a society with lots of information spread all over the place can still aggregate that well, right? So if I just keep averaging and do something really naïve, right? Just counting. I just keep counting and you know, if I hear something more times than something else, I'll upweight that and down-weight the other thing. I can come to really accurate expectations if I do that. The problem is that our networks don't look like this well-balanced, nicely spread out tree that zooms out into the world. Instead. we are often in fairly tightly knit cliques that are organized by ethnicity and gender and age and profession and religion, you know.So we're really in these tight knit groups where we tend to get the same information and then it bounces around in these smaller areas where we're intensely talking    and keep hearing the same thing, and that that gets reinforced and that's where we go wrong.Michael: You know, this is actually a great place to back into some of these bigger economic and power questions, right?Because, you talk about this kind of social learning and how, like you just said, a network in which connections are distributed more evenly can lead to better aggregate estimations of the ground truth of what's actually going on here. But the world that we have is one, you know, where, in part because of the economics of scale, and convenience, you bring up preferential attachment and how it's easier to trust someone that other people we know trust…And so we ended up in these herding dynamics where I think about... You know, I run social media for SFI and so you see these enormous Twitter profiles, and these are people that arguably are just famous because they're famous. And yet they are shifting public sentiment in remarkable ways.They're whales of attention and you get in, you know, I think there's an interesting link between questions about economic inequality and questions of attentional inequality, and how do we ensure that people are not getting more attention than is healthy for society?Matthew: Right. Yeah. I mean, as you mentioned, things that get retweeted are easier to find, so there's this sort of natural building process where we get feedback effects that the more followers you have, the more followers you gain.And the more attention one gets, the easier it is for, for people to keep following. That kind of snowball effect does lead to this really large social disparity, as you're saying. So it's sort of a social and attentional inequality as much as resource inequality.This is a valuable resource. And, for a long time, people in network science had been making up a point of the fact that when you look at networks, it's not just evenly distributed networks. And it's not even something where we just sort of rolled dice and some people got a little bit luckier. You see this extra feedback effect with some people having enormous numbers of followers and other people not. And that makes it really hard for a society to process information. These people can have really outsized influences on our beliefs.Michael: So here's what I think seems at first, like a relatively innocuous example.You know, you tell great stories to anchor this in the concrete in this book, and one of them in particular is about the wine critic, Robert Parker. And I'd love to hear you explain a little bit why he became such a success, but then also why that became a problem for the wine industry.Matthew: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, he's a fascinating example where in one quote from one of the wine distributors talks about how his giving a high rating can be worth millions of euros on the wine. And it's just incredible how much influence he ended up having. And, you know, he sort of started out as a, a person who had a different scale that he was using, a hundred point scale, and he was doing things a little differently. But he ended up calling out a couple of vintages that the rest of the critics were saying weren't going to be that good. And he, he spotted them earlier and he sort of made reputation early on in his career and it just took off.And again, it's a sort of thing where, you know, people are looking for focal points. A lot of times in markets, people are trying to figure out what's, what's something worth and. And in the wine market that's particularly difficult, right? You've got thousands, tens of thousands of different wines, and you're trying to figure out what they're all worth.And so you need some anchor initially in pricing these things, and he became an anchor and then people started looking to him to figure out what was something that was going to be worth, and if he said it was going to be a valuable vintage then people started thinking, wow, you know, this is going to be great. Parker says it is great. And moreover, even if I didn't believe it, I could still believe that everybody else was going to believe Parker. Right? And you end up with these kinds of self-referential systems that, that Keynes talked about and made famous. And he really ended up having a huge influence on the wine industry.And as you point out then, then there were the distortions because then wine makers. Tried to make their wines something that Parker would like. Right? So they called it the Parkerization of wines. He’d like these big, bold, high alcohol wines. And so all the wine makers started, you know, making wines to his taste. Which is fascinating, right? It's,Michael: But then you mentioned that since the advent of the World Wide Web, there's been that kind of a democratization of this process, that it's easier to find information and, you know, I wonder about that in light of these kinds of decision markets. You know, do you think that the web is improving our aggregate grasp on reality by flattening this kind of thing?But yeah. But at the same time, there are other ways that get discussed in this book that the web is leading to just remarkable exponential kind of inequalities as well.Matthew: Yeah. I mean, I think as you point out, that the web brings good and bad things with it. So the one, you've got powerful search engines.We've got this immense connectivity. Anybody can basically put out their own wine newsletter and distribute it very cheaply, in the sense that you put up your own scores on the web and anybody can find them. So it does democratize things. But along with the sort of cheapening of the cost of conveying information and posting things, comes this difficulty that a lot of it is algorithm driven. It’s algorithmic. And those algorithms look for things we like and try to connect us to thinks we like, and they themselves can be built off of trying to connect you with things they think are popular. So the kind of exponential thing we talked about before, where people get connected to it, the more connects the algorithms can do that themselves, right? Because they push up things that are popular and sort of make Top 10 lists and put in popular things. And that can cause a feedback. It can also help us search for people that look a lot like us. So there's a lot of the book that is devoted to this idea of homophily, where people connect with other people who are very similar to themselves and algorithms can really make it much easier to find people who have exactly the same views that you have and exactly the same perspective and exactly the same background. And that's dangerous in some ways.Michael: You bring this up in examining the double-edged sword that having high betweenness centrality, for example, gives you this sort of enormous political power. But in another sense, it exposes you and the entire network to new kinds of risk. And I feel like this is a fine point to dive into your chapter on, on finance and the 2008 crash and how these things came about. In general, there’s a deep question that I want to kind of orbit here, which is, how do we implement ways to balance the potent power of networks and of scaling networks with the new challenges that they issue us?Matthew: Yeah. And I guess financial networks are a fascinating example because when you look at globalization, the amount of trade that we've seen in the world since the second world war has gone up by a factor of four, and financial integration has become worldwide. So right now, you know, if the markets sneeze in China, we know about it the next, next morning in New York. And I think that kind of an interconnectivity is very valuable in terms of helping investment flow to places that need it. And, it's actually been amazingly prosperous for a lot of countries. But at the same time, it means that now we've got this very well-interconnected system, and we saw the, some of the ramifications of that in 2008 where, you know, if we have a few companies that have over invested in in the wrong things — in that case it was subprime mortgages and some other mortgages and various loans — if they've all heavily invested in the same thing at the same time and those investments go sour, that can actually cause a pretty widespread contagion very rapidly. And luckily, we avoided complete catastrophe in terms of a total systemic meltdown, but it was dangerously close, in many ways.Michael: You know, I was in reading this chapter, thinking a lot about the conversation I have with Jennifer Dunne about trophic networks, and you know, her, her conversation about, you know, we tend to think of this in a rather simple way that there's, you know, a keystone species like the Orca. That it, you know, were to be removed from the system, that's “too big to fail,” that would lead to this cascading collapse, but that what they found in this other sense was that the more nodes of these little species that, you know, the ones that we don't consider, that we pull out at the network, you thin the network by like 20% and that leads to cascading extinctions also.And so growing up when I did, I tend to be kind of bitter about the bank bailouts…reading this it makes a lot of sense. Why we're just in this position now of dependency on systems that, are in this sort of unpleasant tension with the individual and with smaller institutions. But is there a sense in which, economists are talking about, the “too small and numerous to fail”? Because a big piece of this when you talk about with respect to news, especially the way that economics of scale…like a great example doesn't come up from the book is the way that Amazon has sort of sucked all the air out of the room for retail. And so at what point is it too centralized and too condensed in one space, that that becomes its own kind of risk?Matthew: Right. I mean, I guess part of the financial system that we're sort of stuck with is the fact that there's two things that are very valuable.One is economies of scale. So actually being a larger enterprise means that you can do different kinds of business and you can be one stop shopping for companies that can come in and get their foreign exchange, and they can do some hedging and they can get loans.So there are values both in a scope and scale of being large and having these large enterprises. And then it's also valuable to have them all very well interconnected because they need to be moving money where the investments are and where things are or are going. And so you end up with a highly connected system.But with lots of nodes, and the nodes tend to be fairly large. So even this sort of smaller ones that you're talking about nowadays are, we're talking billions of dollars, right? So there’s tens of thousands of nodes that are worth billions of dollars and they're all interconnected.And I think that. Part of the real difficulties in managing the system becomes that it's no longer a simple market, where the sort of supply and demand works in the usual sense because now if somebody defaults in one part of the system, that actually can cause defaults for other, right? If I borrow a lot from you and I owe you a bunch. I don't make that payment. Now you can't make your payments. And that goes on. And we can have cascades in that sense. And that was sort of the real crux of the matter. And, in 2008, there were a series of different enterprises that owed money that couldn't of Lehman Brothers was sort of the poster child of it, but AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, there were a bunch of people who had large debts that were unable to make payments on those. And that's where we end up now having a danger. And somehow we have to think about how do we both allow these markets to work, but make sure that they're safeguarded.So you want to step in. You do want some regulation, but you don't want to regulate them out of existence. And that's the hard part, right, is figuring out the right level and how you do this, especially when it's a big complex system.Michael: So in here you compare economic regulation to brain surgery, which I found to be a very appropriate kind of complexity science statement, right?The challenge there, I think that the reason that that particular analogy is so rich is. As you say, you know, we really don't have the brain very well mapped out. Like, I mean, at one level of detail we do. But in terms of really understanding all of the functional relationships and even the ways that regions of the brain are communicating with one another, I mean, there's all these questions about, is photonic or acoustic communication going on? And so they're, you know, it may be that there are kinds of centrality that are not even being measured in the system.And the question of how did we get a better look at the economy when we already have such strong trends for institutions to keep their information proprietary? Like we're actively working against the system in our attempts to understand it, in some respects.Matthew: Yeah. And I think it’s a very strong analogy in the sense that,  right now, scientists are basically mapping out the brain. And if you go and look at what the main concern of most central banks are, go to the Federal Reserve Bank.I’ve talked to people at the Bank of England. You can talk to people at the Bank of France, the Bank of Mexico, and so forth. One of the main things they're trying to do is just map out the system. Really just get ahold of who's really connected to whom. And as you say, the companies don't want to give that information out because it's their proprietary information.They don't want you  to know what their trades are, who they're trading with, what their positions are. And the also the people who are regulating it have a certain scope. So one of the main things they're concerned about is what's known as shadow banking. So we have these large banks, investment banks that are actually regulated and have to make certain kinds of reports and a lot of their dealings you can see. There’s a lot of other institutions that aren't that different than banks — large insurance companies and other people who can actually, issue shares and help you get loans and do different things that aren't regulated in the same way — and the more you start regulating one part of the system, the more the other part of the system grows.So,I always think of this as like whack-a-mole. I don't know if you know that game where every time something pops up and you, you think you've got that part of the system. Then basically the system morphs and people start putting their money elsewhere. You start regulating banks and savings and loans pop up. You start regulating savings and loans and people, you know, investment banks step up. Then hedge funds come and, it just keeps moving and it's a very difficult and involving system.Michael: On top of this, it occurred to me that, when, when we talk about playing with other people's money in terms of our inability to accurately measure the externalities involved in these kinds of decisions, it's a massive blind spot in terms of what the actual transaction that's happening really is. And, it occurred to me that because of the sort of primitive nature of our early 21st Century accounting techniques, there's the sense in which, isn't every transaction playing with other people's money? That until we actually know where the values that we should be measuring resides, we're really kind of just splashing around and this in this brain and you know, God only knows the consequences,Matthew: Right. And when you cut something off in one place and it actually has consequences far away because if you follow the stream back in terms of who owed money to whom, it can be four or five steps removed, and the consequences can be pretty, pretty broad.And I think in general, you know, that part of the system, when you look at the systemic failures, it's been that, the people making the decisions don’t have the risk involved. It's not their personal risk.Michael: Or it doesn’t seem to be. There's that question, which is kind of a kind of a Long Now Foundation question: how do we use regulation, how do we use financial incentive…like you talked about with the vaccinations, you know, how do you get people to care about the longer timescale and the bigger network portrait they're implicated in ?Matthew: Yeah. I think it's very difficult than the financial system because it's so diffuse and so, so interconnected. I think the main thing at this point is really just getting better measurement, and then trying to have a little more advance warning of when people are making really poor decisions.There were years of investments in very similar portfolios by lots of banks and were heavily weighted and leveraged in very narrow investments. That's something that just shouldn't happen. That's easy to identify, but you have to be able to see it. You know, that's like a large tumor growing in the brain and not seeing it. That's not major brain surgery. That's minor. So I think there's some things that, that we can do much better at. And then there's other parts that are going to be more complicated and difficult to deal with in the long run.Michael: There's another link here I think. In your discussion about informal relational networks and romantic relational networks…to get into this thing about the clustering coefficient and embeddedness and dispersion. There's something about how do we motivate people to make decisions for each other and not just put themselves — you know, even though it, those two things are obviously kind of inextricable. It seems very intimately related to this question of, “how likely is this particular couple to stay together?” What do you think about that?Matthew: Yeah, yeah. There's a fun little paper, I'm trying to remember who the authors were, but Jon Kleinberg was one of the authors, and they looked at, at, people's Facebook connections and they were trying to figure out who were spouses and who weren't. So you just look at the network. And so I look at a particular person and I try and figure out who's that person's spouse and the kind of thing, which really tells you how to identify that person is that you end up having a lot of friends in common, but a lot of friends in common across different spheres.So your work friends become known to each other. Your hobby friends, your high school friends, you meet people through all these different things. But if you're very close to somebody, you meet them on many different levels. And so they were able to actually, with high accuracy, point out who somebody's significant other spouse was. And in the cases where it didn't, when they looked back some time later, it turns out that the person, often they'd broken up, right? So when it didn't match their score, in terms of identifying these people, they often turned out that there was a reason for that.Michael: Yeah. It seems as though that, the ability to determine that embeddedness and that dispersiveness of our social networks, again, is kind of an indicator of a good faith. And you know, you talk a lot about the way that, preferential attachment emerges in networks like job referrals.You know, I've gone out to Burning Man a number of times, and there's a kind of very interesting economic conversation going out there with respect to revealing the ways in which gift economies exists in the rest of the world, also. That we've been sort of blind to the ways that our families and our friendships do not rely on this sort of first layer conscious kind of transactional thinking. I mean, obviously at some level you can exhaust the trust with your own family and it becomes like tit for tat. But you know, this question of humanizing the global economy seems to have a lot to do with, again just revealing the ways in which we are leaning on one another and all of these informal ways.Matthew: Yeah. I mean, there's two things that are probably important to for us as humans to recognize. One is that we, we often form relationships for one reason, but they end up serving lots of purposes.Right? So I ended up, hanging out with my colleagues, but I'll end up getting my advice from them and hearing a lot of information from them and other things that weren't the original intended purpose, but also that what we do ends up impacting lots of people in a different way.All of our actions have network consequences. And I think that's where networks get interesting, right? Is the sort of externalities, the fact that if I learn, you know, I spend a lot of time learning some new programming, I can help my friends by spreading that knowledge. And so my acquisition of skills is something that's valuable to other people. And my acquisition of knowledge in general is something that's useful for my whole community. And we don't often think that way. We often think, do I want to learn this? Not do I want to learn this for my community?And those are, those are two different questions. And the second one is what's actually happening in the first one, is the way we often make decisions.Michael: Yeah. I love the, the frequency with which I'm noticing people talk about ikigai.  You know, what you're good at, what you enjoy doing, what the world wants, and what you can get paid for.And I wonder, to the degree that we, you know, like for example, my friends in New York city have the most bizarre, specific jobs that could in no way ever be supported by a city of one 10th the size. And, you know, It raises questions for me about whether the increased multidimensionality of our accounting and the scale of the networks in which we're participating are affording us the opportunity to reach ikigai, to enact it more frequently.Matthew: So there's something that's known as multiplexing, which is interesting, which is an multiplexing is a term that sociologists refer to as sort of layering our networks on top of each other.Right? So I've, I've got my, whoever is helping me out on day to day things, loans, and maybe they're giving me some kind of help. Then there's other people that are giving me advice. There's people who I work with. There's people who I rely on for medical help. There's all kinds of different things that we do. And in small scale societies, traditionally those things are layered very closely to each other. So I interact with the same people for all purposes. And then when you get into larger and larger scale societies, those things can begin to diverge.And New York is probably an extreme example of that, right? Where people can really specialize, not just in what they do, but they can be talking to very different people for different purposes. And that allows that specialization, right? So that I go to one person for very particular kinds of information and I go for somebody else for other kinds of things in a small village that it might be the same person that I'm transacting with who is also giving me, you know, my mental health advice.And that's not necessarily a good thing. Right? And so I think these larger scale societies allow you to, to sort of disentangle those relationships and specialize a bit more.Michael: And yet, we've been at this point for over a century where we have trouble with the scale of modern life, even comprehending it. I'd like to open this piece up to the fake news problem and how networks do not just inform and empower us, but they also can mislead us or lead us into making, decisions that are ultimately maladaptive.Matthew: Right. So, yeah.Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, one of the fascinating things about humans, and there's a nice book by Joe Henrich, this sort of talks about what's special about humans. And I think one thing that's special about humans is that we were able to grasp concepts in the abstract. So lots of species can teach their young, they can help each other. They do all kinds of things that humans do. They communicate. But what we do that's very different is I can tell you something like, you know, I was just in China last week, I could say, and I could explain a city to you that I'd been to, and you maybe have never been there, but you could begin to imagine it and see what it's like.And so humans have this ability to communicate things in the abstract and then imagine them and store them. That also has makes us susceptible to superstitions, to false beliefs. I can tell you something that's not true, and you can imagine it and believe it, and if it's a coherent story, then it's something that you can begin to grasp onto. And when we combine that with the network structures where we're hearing things from maybe the same people or hearing them over and over again, and we have the susceptibility to believe things that aren't necessarily true. That opens us up to lots of difficulties in terms of what's truth and where is it residing in a network. Michael: So there's a kind of a backflow or reflux that I see going on that's related to Alvin and Marie Toffler’s Future Shock and people pulling out of systems, retreating to sort of fundamentalist communes or the rise of nationalist extremism that, I think is pretty much on everyone’s mind these days.And you know, I wonder is in a way at least it seems a local optimum to extract oneself from a network that you realize is exposing you to these kinds of risks. That in a way at the, in a sort of local sense, it seems like pulling out of the system is actually adaptive. Science fiction author, Charles Stross has this really interesting thought experiment in his book Glass House that humankind has gone fully digital.And so you're, you're backed up on a server somewhere and guaranteed immortality. But what this does is it exposes everyone to the threat of being hacked. You know? And so this, this was a book written before the internet of things, but I think that this gets into these kinds of questions of, “Do I or do I not put in a smart pacemaker?,” are very real difficult questions.Matthew: Right. Yeah. I mean, I think one thing that I take away from my studies and networks is just an awareness of how insular our networks tend to be and how we don't realize how homophilistic the world is and how much we tend to be talking to other people who are similar to ourselves.We don't realize how much over-weighting we can be or how much weight we can be placing on a single individual, either directly or indirectly in terms of of their influence on us. And I think, you know, just asking simple things we can do every day are ask, when somebody tells us something, ask more about that source, right?Where, where did they really hear that? Where did that information come from? Why did they come to that belief? And those kinds of questions can really be illuminating. And also putting yourself in completely uncomfortable situations. I always think it's very valuable, right? So going places you would never normally go talk to people that you wouldn't normally talk to.People walk into a room and you can see it at a large conference or something. People naturally gravitate towards the people who are of their same subfield and their same whatever. They see a friend and they zoom right to that. It's not that they go out and meet new people and expand their horizons, it's that they're sort of reinforcing their smaller communities. And that's something that's natural for us. But it could be very confining.Michael: You bring this up with the Schelling segregation. For those who aren't familiar with this, the model suggests that all you need is to not want to be in a very, very small minority that leads to like these complete segregation of neighborhoods.So that kind of begs the question, “What evolutionary forces incentivize this kind of exploratory aisle-crossing and curious and recombinant kind of behavior?” So, we know that cities kind of do this. That cities as social reactors encourage active mixing, right? How do you see this being deployed in economic regulation and these kind of areas, or how do you imagine it could be deployed?Matthew: I think it's very difficult actually. So, you know, one area that was fascinating was when you looked at, if you go back to the 1970s and 1980s, there was a push by a lot of school districts to try and build more ethnically balanced schools.And they worked hard to do that. And what they ended up building was the larger schools that then could allow them to bring people together from different areas. Sometimes it was busing, sometimes it was just putting together different school districts. And they built these larger things that on paper were very well balanced.But then when you looked inside the schools, they became the most segregated schools because then the friendship patterns inside — you had these large enough groups that it all split up. And so it's a really difficult thing to do. So even when you build large cities, you know, the cities end up with their neighborhoods and their structures internally. It's not an easy problem. And I think part of it is just people have to be conscious of it. And you know, you have to sort of encourage… At first, I always thought, there's a lot of funding available as a scientist for interdisciplinary work, and you always think, why are they just promoting it? Do they really know what they're promoting? They just want to put people together, and so forth. But I think we under-explore in that sense, right?Because on a day to day basis, we're often rewarded and it's easy for us to feel comfortable around people. It's just more pleasant. Everything on a day to day basis, being in your own comfortable niche where you know everybody, you know what they're going to say, you understand what they're talking about and so forth. Rather than going out and suddenly feeling like an idiot and not understanding anything that's going on and being in a place that really makes you feel uneasy.That's hard. But it's valuable. Right? So it's difficult.Michael: This is sort of related to the question of…in reading your section on accounting at the macroeconomic scale, this seems like one of the great promises to me of the blockchain, right? That we have this network level view that we can use this network level view to tokenize previously invisible forms of value, to make certain kinds of economic activity or human activity, human effort, to bring it into the labor portrait.But then again, like…we’ve been touching on it a lot. There’s this sense, like Kevin Kelly talks about the expansion of ignorance, like the more you know, the more you know what you're doing.Matthew: Right, right.Michael: And so, what do you see as the sort of emergent problems or emergent risks of having a better portrait of what's actually going on?Matthew: Yeah, and I guess it's always hard to think that better and more information is dangerous. I think here, having a better view of the fuller world and how our communication is taking place. I think it'll help us understand a lot of the polarization that's going on. And you know, there's sort of two main forces that are changing in the world right now and that are leading to a world that's much more fractional.At one level it's this connectivity which allow us things to spread very easily and to sort of take root. And the other is this tendency of us to sort of separate ourselves. And at the same time, there's a bunch of fundamental economic forces that are leading to inequality, which sort of push societies to have more nationalistic views and the rise of populism. So it's a difficult situation, but I think being aware of these things allows us to understand some difficulties that are much more structural and social, and not just plain economics. So there's always a tendency when we see economic problems to say, “Okay, well let's put money on it. We'll tax this, we'll subsidize this, we'll move money around. You know, for inequality, we should be moving money here and there.”But these are deep structural problems that are leading to a lot of this stuff. And if we understand those structural problems and where the networks come into play, that leads to a very different prescription for sort of long-term health. Don't just treat the symptoms, these local problems that we're having, but, you know, start dealing with these structural issues, which are really at the heart of a lot of the sort of long-term societal problems that we face.Michael: You talk about Moving To Opportunity as this seems like a really great example. Care to talk about that a little?Matthew: Sure, yeah. Moving To Opportunity was a fascinating study that the US government did in the 90s and there what they did is they took families and they had control group that they didn't do anything with. And then they had two different groups.One, they gave vouchers for housing and they said, “We'll pay for your housing, but you have to move to a wealthier neighborhood.” So they were taking people from the bottom of the income distribution and they said, “You have to move to this other neighborhood in order to get paid.” And then there was another group that they said, “We'll just pay for your housing, but you can stay where you are.”And then, you know, fast forward 20 years and people, now there's a series of papers that have looked at the, outcomes of that. And there's a paper by a Raj Chetty, Nathan Hendron, and Larry Katz, that that sort of mapped out, say, take an eight year old who was moved from one of the poor neighborhoods to one of the wealthier neighborhoods, and look at what their lifetime earnings impact of that move is.Look at an eight year old to stay behind. And then one who moved has about $300,000 extra expected lifetime earnings, which is nontrivial. I mean, this is a . They have all kinds of measures. Health is better, lower rates of incarceration, teenage pregnancy goes down.So there's all kinds of benefits from just taking somebody out of one neighborhood and moving them to another neighborhood. And that gives us a powerful measure of how important that community is in terms of affording you the opportunities to sort of advance and to get educated and to get employment and to avoid a lot of troubles.But that's not easy to do, right? We can't socially engineer the whole world where we start moving everybody around, but it points out how powerful the network structure is in terms of offering you those opportunities.Michael: You know, that that kind of mixing actually seems to be an effect of the internet, like time and time again, looking at aggregate decision making or the way that information diffuses…you've got all these great examples in here. Like taking the estimate weight of the ox, and how you want one of those degree models on this. And over time, everyone kind of evens out. And I looked at that and I saw the way that the so-called developing world has really come up at the same time that the, the priority and dominance of some of the first world nations, like the United States has really been challenged by the rise of the World Wide Web.And so you joke in here about our Star Trek future. But I think, you know, there's a sense in which, in spite of the rising inequality that we see when we cut this in certain ways, there's another sense in which it does seem as though the baseline, the eradication of extreme poverty and so on, is really going up.And so I'm curious, immersing yourself in this, as you do, where do you stand? How hopeful are you? What do you consider the most sort of optimistic revelations of this kind of research?Matthew: I mean, I think the most amazing things that I found looking at these were how important international trade and globalization has been, in two ways. One is, you've sort of mentioned a few. If you look at world poverty rates, they've fallen fairly dramatically, and there's still an enormous amount of work to be done. And the rates that they call poverty rates are really low. And so it's not a high benchmark, but that's certainly made a big difference. And if you go to China now compared to China 30 years ago, I mean, it's an enormously wealthier nation and many more people are living prosperous lives. So that's wonderful.And then on the other hand, you also get another benefit, which has been peace. And I think this is something we really under-appreciate.I did a study with Stephen Nye where we looked at the levels of conflict over time and level of conflict have fallen by a factor of 10. If look at wars between the Napoleonic War period up through the Second World War, countries were just routinely at war. It was just a sort of a constant fact of life.And if you look since then, it’s very rare for countries that trade with each other to be at war. And so that's brought an immense peace to the world. And so, you know, the interconnectivity, and that's really a trade network, and it's a very dense network, and you can look at it and it's not nuclear weapons, it's not democracies. You can control for all these things. It's really the trade that that ends up [doing it]. It's very difficult to find anything else mattering. So I think you can be really optimistic on a lot of grounds in terms of how the interconnectedness is helping the world. And then it's, you're seeing it on the web now.I've been teaching courses on Coursera. People all around the world can beat learning game theory, right? For me, I teach a course on networks and people all around the world come up to me and say, “I took your course on networks. There wasn’t anything at my university on this.” And, you know, that's something that's really an evener. And so you see great hope from that.The difficulties are that this also allows us to do other things and there's always good and bad that comes with any kind of technological advance.Michael: Yeah, you mention — this is on page two 33 of the hardcover — you mention, “If one wants a recipe for lowering the incidence of wars in Africa, in the Middle East, the message is clear: grow the economies and the regional trade networks and especially promote trade between potential adversaries.”And so again, we're back to this question of. How do we encourage the mixing, you know, Nelson Mandela working with apartheid and getting people into these reconciliatory conversations. What is that gonna take in a world as polarized as the world that we have.Matthew: Yeah. I think, you know, part of it is when you look at diplomacy, diplomacy is still very much thought of as a, a political thing where people are trying to write contracts and write alliance papers and sorta, but somehow, unless those things are really embedded in longterm trade/development issues, you won't see a permanent change. So, if you look in the Middle East and you look at the countries that are there, basically, if you look at Israel, you can't find any of its direct neighbors, which are in the top 10 of its trade partners. Its trade partners are all Europe, America… You know, it's not trading locally. It's trading out to the rest of the world. And as long as that keeps working that that means you're going to have conflict.You know, the neighbors, they’re not trading with each other. They see each other as adversaries and competitors, not as partners. And it's very difficult to change that, for lots of reasons. But until that's changed, we're not going to see a change, I don't think, in sort of long-term peace in that region.Michael: It’s interesting listening to you talk about this now, it reminds me of my experience as a musician in Austin, Texas, right? Where as the real estate values went up, major venues started closing and artists started looking outside of the community for their, for work, you know?And so artists were gone, most of the year on tour, and when they came home, they were in this very adversarial relationship with this emerging new class of like software programmers and venture capitalists that had come in, and real estate agents. And suddenly the town is cut down the middle by this, this tension between what historically has given it its identity and what is now really causing it to grow and thrive in the way that it is.And so this is, you know, these are problems that I think are are really ubiquitous and universal problems. This is not just like geopolitical stuff. This is something that I think all of us can identify at work in our own lives.I'm curious just to kind of tie a bow on this, I'm curious to move beyond the book. What are you working on now? And then also what do you see as some of the most promising avenues that this research is taking, both in your own work and under the work of your colleagues?Matthew: Sure. So two things I'm working on now that I really excited about.One is developing real measures of social capital to try and understand what it is that helps people, as we talked about the Moving To Opportunity.So can we put numbers on those? Can, can we really figure out what it is that affects a person? Is it knowledge? Is it just, if I want somebody to understand education and then understand how they can improve their lives, what kinds of information do they need? Or is it access? Is it that they have to have doors open for them and they have to have an ability to have a friend have done something to be able to pull them into that.So that's one area and there I think we can see very strong notions of social capital and the importance of that and getting education and so forth. The other is something we talked about in terms of financial and other kinds of networks. And I think increasingly, we’re able to start mapping out those kinds of networks and look at how economies work, trade flows, financial flows, and really understand how it is that changes in one part of an economy ripple through.And the better the mapping, you know, again this, it looks like mapping the brain out is sort of, you know, we're at that mapping part and the better those maps get, the better we'll understand how to begin to intervene and to begin to make the system stronger and better because it's evolving on its own and not necessarily always in good ways. A lot of things happen. We know that the growth and globalization we've been talking about, a lot of these things are wonderful, but the system sort of on on its own trajectory in the question is, can we understand that trajectory and and can we nudge it sometimes in a little better direction?Michael: What do you suppose would be the takeaway. Assuming nothing about whoever's listening to this show, what do you think would be some of the most empowering advice that you could offer people in terms of understanding these kinds of systems in our place and the systems? That people can use to increase their personal mobility and their opportunity and so on.?Matthew: I guess that one piece of, of putting people, put yourself in an uncomfortable situation. And I think by far the best personal advice you can come up with out of these things because it's easy to underestimate the power of our social structures and how constraining they are.So our lives, we think of as all our decisions, and we've made all these choices in our lives, but all those choices were made in a pretty narrow set of options. It's not as if we had every possible choice we could make. And understanding that is really critical. And so somehow if we can expand our horizons and expand those sets of options, that's where real, I dunno, enlightenment comes from, I think in terms of, you know, better understanding the world.That's a hard thing to do though.Michael: Wonderful. Matthew, thank you so much for talking with us.Matthew: Thanks, Mike. It's been wonderful.
12,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: So Brian, it's a pleasure to meet you here amidst the complexity.Brian: Thank you. Delighted to be here.Michael: I think I'd like to take this conversation in three parts. One, kind of looking back at the history of the development of complexity economics and the argument for it that you've put forward in a book and in numerous papers. And then to dig into the actual mechanisms involved and to explore some of the ideas that you get into in The Nature of Technology.Michael: And then you have a 2017 article for McKinsey that I thought was really fascinating in terms of looking forward into the shape that the new economics systems are taking. So if that sounds good to you…Brian: It sounds great.Michael: Awesome. So you were there at the beginning of the Santa Fe Institute's articulation of complexity economics. And I'm curious, what brought that together in the first place, and what got you involved and what you saw, you and the other people involved saw as the need that you were addressing at the time.Brian: Right. In 1987, there was a famous meeting held here at the Santa Fe Institute in September, and it was decided that about 10 scientists and 10 economists would be brought together by Phil Anderson, who's a Nobel prize winning physicist, David Pines, very eminent physicist, and Kenneth Arrow, Nobel economist, and they brought 10 of us together. The science group included luminaries like John Holland, very famous these days, David Ruelle mathematician, and Stu Kauffman and others. And on the economics side you had Larry Summers who went on to be president of Harvard, Tom Sargent, who in the future would get a Nobel in economics, and others including myself.This was financed by John Reed of Citibank. There's a general feeling with John Reed and others that economics somehow hadn't properly delivered. They were heavily involved, Citibank was heavily involved in South America, made a lot of sovereign loans to the tune of many billions of dollars. And the governments in some of those countries had reneged on the loans. John Reed thought there must be a better way to do economics because economists had assured him all of this would be okay.So we met here in Santa Fe and there was great interest for 10 days in that meeting about looking at the economy quite vaguely, not as an equilibrium perfect machine humming over and needing a few bits of fine tuning, but rather as an evolving complex system. None of us quite knew what that meant, but we were trying to figure that one out.Michael: So I remember, you spoke at the annual symposium this weekend and you mentioned that there was a period where all of you were kind of fishing around for the new framework, for the new lens through which to look at this.Brian: Yeah. Well a year later after that incredible meetings in Santa Fe, the Institute here decided they would form a program funded by Citibank on the economies involved in a complex system. I was brought here from Stanford to run the program. And in due course we hired some people. We got really good people here, first rate people because of Arrow and Anderson being able to lure them in. So we decided we were going to look at the economies involved in complex system, but we were sitting around the kitchen in the old Santa Fe Institute on Canyon Road and we didn't quite know what that would involve. We thought vaguely some people thought we should study chaos theory. This was 30 years ago now, 1988. Some people thought we should study high tech and network effects, which I'd studied a lot about. And other people in other ideas. And we didn't know quite what to do.I should add at this point that standard economics looks at the world, as I said, as being quite mechanistic and sees a lot of forces as being in balance or in equilibrium. And in particular if you look at producers, firms and consumers and prices, they see the world as adjusting so the prices that appear in the economy are enough that no consumer, given what they're earning, can do any better with their budget, and no firm can do any better with its means of production. The whole economy's a bit like the spider's web where every little thread is keeping the other threads in equilibrium.That was the point of view in economics that had come about in the 1870s, 1880s. Some of it borrowed from the physics of that day. And all through the 1900s that was the dominant way of looking at the economy. And it's been extremely successful. It's fashionable to complain or deride economists, but actually economists have been able to understand things like the macroeconomy pretty well, central banking, monopolies, how to set up auctions and markets that were properly trading agreements. These are all extremely well understood in economics, thanks to the theory that was built upon the standard approach.What we wanted to do was not certain, we sat around and debated for a time and there were a couple of things happened at that stage. Stuart Kauffman, who's a theoretical biologist, was sitting there and he said to me, he said to our group, he says "There's something I don't understand. Why do you guys in economics do everything at equilibrium?" And I just said, "Well, because we do Stuart, so shut up." "No, no, why do you?" And he persisted. And finally I and a couple of the others who were trained economists said, "It's a good question, Stuart. Let's think about that and take it in." None of us could see how to do that. But I thought that was worth kind of noting on the blackboard as a direction that we could take.In the meantime, because I wasn't sure I was directing the group, I wasn't quite sure what our thing would be for the year or two years hence. So I called Arrow and Anderson and I said, "Hey look we're happy to do something here. Do you want to give us a bit of guidance?" They were godfathering the program. So they called John Reed in New York and the word came back from Reed, "Do anything you want providing it is not conventional and providing it set the foundations of the field of economics."And Arrow phoned me. There were no emails, and Arrow phoned me in Santa Fe with that piece of advice. I was floored. I didn't know what to say. I couldn't believe it. Later, a bit later, like a day or two later, I thought, "Oh my God, this is like 1520 in Wittenberg or somewhere, that the Vatican has phoned up the Augustinians and Martin Luther and said, "Hey you guys, I hear you want to redo theology, go ahead. But providing it's not conventional and totally to the fundamental field." It was like getting instructions from God, "Do anything you want."And because Santa Fe Institute was isolated and it has no departments and no economics department, we could do this as a kind of skunkworks, a little private group without anybody complaining or wagging fingers, "You can't do that. You can't do that." So that's when we started to look at the economy as an evolving complex system.Michael: So there's two dimensions that you discuss in “Complexity and the Economy” and I'll be sure to share the essay from that on complexity economics in the show notes here. You talk about endogenously generated non-equilibrium and how there's two factors that really feature here. One being fundamental uncertainty and the other being technological innovation. That the addition of these two factors are a major piece of this new way of seeing. I'd love to hear you dive into that a little.Brian: Sure. So there we were in the old convent probably half a dozen of us in economics, maybe an equal number probability theorists and mathematicians and one theoretical biologist, etc. And we decided we'd start to look at the economy as a non-equilibrium system, but that brought its own difficulties.First of all, there was a very strong feeling in economics that if the economy wasn't in equilibrium and be a bit like a ship teetering over, but it would soon right itself and be back in equilibrium. So really non-equilibrium was rare and it was an exception and maybe wasn't worth looking into, etc. Where would non-equilibrium come from in the first place?And I began to realize that if you're looking at economics the standard way, we tend to assume that all the little players in the puzzle we're looking at in any part of the economy, they're all identical by assumption, and they all have a well defined economic problem they're trying to solve, and they're all perfectly rational, which means they can do an infinite amount of logic and mathematics on their own case and solve that and they'll solve it in such a way that we can call a solution the outcome of what they're all doing together.We call it a solution of that outcome. Doesn't ask for further changes. But that assumes that other people are like you, that you know what problem you're in, that you can do all this mysterious logic that might have taken an economist six months to figure out and the people in the little model you're working on can do this instantaneously, etc. And we began to realize — we’re not the first to realize this, but we began to realize that any realistic economic problem where you've said four or five other players, like some startup in Silicon Valley, you don't quite know who the other players are going to be at the outset.You don't know what the game's going to be. Suppose you're starting up and you're in the field of autonomous trucking. You're going to have driverless trucks and convoys going across the country and you might be Google or you might be Volvo or someone financing this.You don't know how the technology is going to work. You don't know who the other players will be. You don't know what the regulations are going to be or the legalities or the insurance background or how other people on the road are going to accept this.So you're in a whole cloud, not just of not quite knowing probabilistically. You completely don't know. There's a large area you don't know and it's a fundamental unknowing. Economists call that fundamental uncertainty. And so you kind of assume an equilibrium in a case like that because people are trying to make sense of the situation and may or may not be in equilibrium at the outset.And there's another big source of uncertainty. You don't know what technology is going to come down the pike in the next year or two or in the next five years, whatever horizon you're in. Fields are very rapidly changing. Commercial banking's changing at the moment, or retail banking because we now have blockchain, and we have Bitcoin, and we've all sorts of other things, artificial intelligence coming in. These things are coming in rapidly and they're disrupting and changing what might otherwise be a business that's relatively at equilibrium.So non-equilibrium we began to realize was standard. It's the standard. Occasionally the sea goes flat, the waves vanish and there's plain sailing. But we began to realize that that was the exception rather than the rule.Michael: Something I really appreciated in this is, I think we were talking about this right before we started recording, that this is symbolic of a larger trend in the sciences. A movement away from this sort of idealized deductive rationality and into a sort of more humble bounded rationality or inductive reasoning. And you made a great point in your talk the other night that this isn't just how we make these kind of like business decisions. This is how people decide to get married. This this is the reality of our mundane daily existence.Brian: Yeah. We got to the point where we realized that non-equilibrium wasn't just an exception. That was the norm. It's like saying the oceans normally have waves and they're not in a perfect calm condition. Non-equilibrium was the norm. But the problem is how do you do economics when there's no equilibrium expected and the questions you're looking at are ill-defined? If you don't know what people are going to do, the problem you're trying to look at isn't well-defined. And that means rational behavior in that problem is not well defined. You can't have a logical solution to a problem that isn't well-defined.And so we had to sort of throw overboard all the standard assumptions in economics that there are logical, rational agents, that problems were well-defined, that everything was in equilibrium. What could we or should we put in its place?It was there that I began to realize that we had something we could put in its place and for me this was a real breakthrough. As part of our group, we had a really extraordinary scientist called John Holland who had worked for many years at the University of Michigan. As it turns out, John I believe was the first PhD in the United States in computer science. He'd been trained at MIT. And John's expertise was looking at how ill-defined systems could be such that some computer program like playing checkers or something could learn in such a system how to make sense of it and how to move ahead and how to improve.It began to be clear to me that also that in our standard world ill-defined problems were the norm. They weren't the exception either. We get married and it's quite ill-defined who on Earth we're moving in with and how well that's going to operate. We have children. We don't know what that's about until we start to do that. We take up jobs. We're not quite sure how that will operate. Yet we do all these things and we do it happily and routinely.What John was pointing out, John Holland was pointing out to us was that you could model human beings not as rational beings, but as people who could start to make sense in the problem they're sitting in maybe by analogy, maybe by having hypotheses that they'd brought in from the past. I think it might be a bit like this. I was in Japan before. Now I'm in Korea. Maybe it operates similarly, maybe not, and they would learn.They would have hypothesis and have their own takes on how things were operating and they might change their hypothesis or the model they were using. They could be quite complicated models in their mind or they could be rather simple ones. They could come from behavioral economics. If we wanted to look for how people really reason. They could come from knowledge of the past. In the past I've faced similar problems. I'm going to try and go at it this way.So John Holland was showing us how we could make mathematical models, rigorous models where the little players in any given situation didn't quite know what on Earth they were doing but were mutually learning together. As they learned, they acted. As they acted, the situation would change. As the situation changed, they would relearn and update their ideas of what they were doing. Maybe that would converge to an equilibrium. Maybe it wouldn't.One of the things I learned from John Holland was I remember saying to him one night over a beer I said, "Don't grandmasters know a lot more about chess, and so they understand much more about the game than before?" But I said, "It's still an equilibrium. They're just better players then there were a century ago because there's been more experience with chess."John said no. He said it's not just that there's been more experience with chess. The game has shifted. So the level of play has shifted. It's got much better. There's a frontier where the game is changing and people at the master level are learning and pushing out that frontier all the time so that if someone from a hundred years ago showed up, they wouldn't be able to compete anywhere near as well as they could a hundred years ago.This shocked me. It meant that these problems, the problems themselves might be not that well-defined. It's not well-defined how I should move in chess because I don't know you very well. I don't know how you think very well. I'm trying to find out as I go along. I'm studying your past games maybe. But it's not that well known. But what John was pointing out was that the whole situation shifts as more is learned.Michael: Yeah. So there's that “bringing a knife to a gunfight” kind of quality.Brian: Exactly!Michael: This is where it gets very interesting for me, because this dimension of having to anticipate or learn from the behaviors of other agents in the system. And you talk about how this means that the economy is a collective computation.Brian: That's right.Michael: And so there's a really interesting example that you bring up in this piece about Kristian Lindgren and the evolutionary game theory and running iterated simulations of the prisoner's dilemma. And I'd love to hear you go into that because I think that that's a really interesting place to leap from that and into technological systems as evolutionary ecological systems.Brian: Okay. One of the examples that really interested me was by a physicist from Sweden called Kristian Lindgren. It was a little bit after the time I was talking about with John Holland. And Lindgren was looking at what we thought of in those days as a prisoner's dilemma tournament. You don't need to know much about prisoner's dilemma. Think of it as a hundred different strategies for playing this game called prisoner's dilemma are competing. And they're competing against each other for the first hundred moves and then somebody wins more than another, and so they've won that round.What Lindgren had set up on his computer was the idea that strategies that won consistently could reproduce themselves, and so if one strategy was particularly good when playing randomly other strategies, including itself, it would reproduce and do pretty well, and others strategies that didn't do well would drop out. We'd have a sort of trap door and they'd be thrown out.The interesting thing about what Kristian Lindgren did that fascinated me was he didn't just set this up as an automatic game automata or algorithms on the computer strategies can play. That had been done I think before. The kicker in his world was that the strategies every so often could mutate and get deeper. They could remember more moves back. And so you might be playing with strategies that just remembered one move back and then suddenly a strategy could discover how to play two moves back. And that would be obviously an advantage because they'd have more knowledge of what their opponent was doing and so on.So suddenly these strategies began to mutate and deepen and have deeper memories of how to play that game as it was ongoing. Remember more moves back. And some of those strategies obviously started to take over.What interested me in Lindgren's model, he ran this thing for, I don't know, maybe 60,000 tournaments or 60,000 gos. Must've taken in 1991 probably three days or two weeks on the computer. But Lindgren ran this thing and there'd be periods where there was clearly a best strategy and the other strategies started to disappear. But you'd see some of those other strategies staying in the game because they were also necessary. If the superior strategy just played itself, it didn't do that well. It needed some strategies almost as fodder. The wolves need some sheep to eat, otherwise they won't be wolves. So there's a balance there.And then other times deeper strategies would be discovered. One or two of those might take off for a while and beat everything in sight. And then there'd be other periods where there's a gigantic free for all and you'd see for maybe a lengthy time of 1,000 or 50,000 tournaments, it would be like a situation where there was a lot of random strategies being created but nothing quite dominated. It looked quite chaotic. And then maybe an even deeper strategy would take over.I remember looking at Lindgren's results and thinking this is what I would call paleontology or paleontological economics, meaning that there are long periods, perhaps like before the KT boundary, where you'd get all the dinosaurs and then suddenly something would happen. A smarter strategy would be discovered, might've been mammals or something, whatever. And the whole game would change and you'd be in a new eon where that would last for a while. But there was no equilibrium in this sort of game. Things just kept getting discovered and discovered.And also it seemed to me that there were strategies that depended on other strategies. Some strategies were almost parasitic. They could stay a bit like the flu virus as long as there were hosts for them. Other strategies competed, other strategies collaborated, but none of this was built in. This all emerged from what Lindgren was showing.And the bottom line in all of this was I realized that if you look at economics this way, this was a very well-defined game. It was well known in the literature. He was holding a tournament for strategies and watching how strategies changed and mutated over time. But the whole thing was not like any machine, it was biological, it was paleontological, it's for all the world reminded me of species competing, a new species being discovered, so to speak.And for me, why Lindgren study so much was economics suddenly became biological. In fact, I've begun to realize that complexity economics, if you want to have a quick one liner, is standard economics views the economy essentially as a machine with all parts in balance. Complexity economics views the economy as an ecology with strategies or forecasts or actions competing to see which will dominate. But then maybe new things being discovered all the time. And so for me, suddenly economics became much more like modern ecology.Michael: And it's funny looking at this over history, my background is in paleontology and you don't learn about dinosaurs without learning that there was this... Until very, very recently, at least in the West, we went through a similar kind of a paradigm shift where it was believed that all forms were created as they are. Everything was static, that things could shift. But ultimately there was a sort of equilibrium of species and their roles. And then right before the discovery of the dinosaur, you get this catastrophe in the paradigm of like realizing that things have gone extinct.Brian: Yeah.Michael: And then it wasn't long after that, that we developed a theory of the origin of species. And so in a lot of ways it seems as though economics has been trailing biology and ecology in this movement only because perhaps the systems are so much more abstract or so much more complex that it's just taken us longer to see them.Brian: Yeah, I think that economics was born actually, essentially as an intellectual pursuit around about the time of the enlightenment in the 1700s. And the enlightenment tended to view the world as being very highly ordered. You didn't always know the mechanisms, just like before Newton, you didn't quite know why the planets moved in elliptical orbits. But if you thought about it, you might get the theory just like Newton did and things were highly ordered, things were largely in equilibrium. All of that apparatus got brought into economics in the 1700s. Now we're realizing that it's not that simple and the economy is certainly always changing and never, probably, at rest.I don't say there's something terribly wrong with the equilibrium way of thinking. My view is that it works very well indeed for a number of problems and it's given us a huge amount of insight. But then I would say, "Okay, what about the rest of the economy?" Economic development, for example, is not by definition is not an equilibrium system. Structural change, that's not an equilibrium. Technological change, never an equilibrium, etc. So there are major parts that the theory couldn't look at if it insisted on equilibrium. And that's what I find is happening now.There quite a while ago, Los Alamos, maybe during the war, mathematicians were arguing over linear systems with linear types of mathematics and nonlinear systems, which were somewhat unfamiliar. And it was Stan Ulam who pointed out very famously. Somebody said, "Well, we know an awful lot about linear systems, that's huge. These nonlinear systems, these are exceptions and they're not well studied and we don't know much about them. And with a bit of luck, that'll be a rather small set of things to think about." And Ulam said, "No." He said, "It's a bit like saying there's a theory of elephants and now we're going to have a theory of non elephants." So non-equilibrium is a theory of non-elephants and equilibrium, at least as far as I'm concerned, is very necessary. I wouldn't stop teaching it. It's central to economics, but it is a fairly constricted system of assisting things. Can only be studied at equilibrium.Again, people in complexity are fond of pointing out that you can tell awful lot about butterflies if you chloroform them or whatever you need to do and nail them to a board. That's fine. We know all about their arms and legs and parts and wings, but if you really want to understand how they work, it's better to study them when they're not dead, when they're flying around. And you can study how they operate. So it's a widening of economics that I'm pointing out, it's not an either/or situation. As economists, and not just in Santa Fe, but in several other places…we’re starting to think, okay, we've had 150 years of equilibrium economics. What would it be like to have non equilibrium economics?And I remember early on like 1999, 10 years after we started at Santa Fe, I was publishing a paper in Science on the economy and complexity. And I was asked by Science to give the approach a name and they insisted and I said, okay. This was on a telephone call. I said, "Okay, let's call it complexity economics." And I realized vaguely at the time that anything I said might lock in. And it did. Now, I don't know, it's debatable, but I sort of think maybe I should have called this non-equilibrium economics. And I wouldn't change now because there's quite a cohort of people who call this complexity economics and it fits well with complexity. So that's okay.Michael: There's something that comes, looking at the 60,000 iterations of the prisoner's dilemma ecosystem in this. When you compare it to a paleozoological study, this looks exactly like around... Is it around the same time, maybe just a couple of years before that Gould and Eldredge published on punctuated equilibrium? You make this…Brian: Evolution by jerks and creeps.Michael: Yeah, jerks and creeps. Maybe it was a little too on the nose. You make a point later in this article that a lot of this has to do with, you're looking at this system at different scales and that adding the dynamical component, adding time gives you different rates of change and that system can appear to be an equilibrium certain times, can be in a kind of a complex flow at other times and then at other times becomes so difficult for the agents involved to predict it, that it's essentially chaotic.Brian: Yes, that's correct.Michael: And to just sit with the trinity there of these three systems and how they appear to be sort of attractors. I guess maybe that's like too recursive or meta, but that the system is moved from one phase into another phase and then back as endogenously generated complexity or external disturbances occur. But then at the same time… So there's that sense in which you find points of stability or change. But then over the course of that history, you're seeing the strategies of those individual players getting longer and longer memories. More and more capacity to model their environment. And there's this very interesting through-line to, what does a non-equilibrium economics tell us about the emergence of biological complexity?Brian: Yeah.Michael: And you talk about this quite a bit in your drawing of the analogy between biology and technology in your book.Brian: Yeah.Michael: So I'd love to use this as the opportunity where we explore, how you see technology itself as an evolutionary system.Brian: Sure.Michael: Yeah. And so just like for starters…where do you see technology start? How old is technology here? Because I mean, the more I read your book, the more it seemed like the differences were rather kind of arbitrary between biology and technology. We look at this as a multi-scale thing and like you get into extended phenotypes and you yourself in the nature of technology, extend the definition of technology to our ideas. That we're using to operate on the world. So I mean...Brian: Well, let me dive in here.Michael: Yeah. Maybe you should provide some context.Brian: Yes, of course. What fascinated me. I'm trained as an engineer, I should say. And I've been fascinated just about all my life with technology. Funny enough, technology even more than science or mathematics, and I realized that with human beings, technology goes way back. You could argue that fire is a technology. It's something we developed or used for our own human purposes, say for cooking or keeping wild animals away or whatever we used it for. Even before that you could say humans’ linguistic abilities, human speech. Quite far later, the ability to write. These are all technologies. They're all means to human purposes and so you could go arbitrarily far back with human beings back to at least three million years and find uses of quite primitive technologies.People looking at this quite vaguely for roughly since Darwin's book. Let me say a word or two about this. Darwin's book came out in 1859. It was read a couple of years later by Samuel Butler who had left England to get away from an overbearing father and actually Butler's grandfather had been the head of the school and had taught the young Darwin. I think in Salisbury. Butler was in New Zealand. Darwin's book arrived and it fired up Butler's imagination to ask could there be a theory of evolution for technology? He was thinking in terms of steam engines. This was the around 1861 and he started to ask that question. That question was never satisfactorily answered. Could there be a theory of evolution for technology? Could we see a line of descent, not just say for sailing ships from rather primitive dugout canoes, but for all of technologies. So that there might be a tree of speciation or of ancestry for all of technology, the way Darwin had demonstrated this for biological species.People had to go at this on and off, but largely things didn't quite work out. They assumed that evolution meant the same as Darwin's mechanism. So you could say, well, if you vary railway locomotives, you will get newer locomotives. If you vary helicopters, you'll get more modern designs and helicopters descend from previous helicopters and things like that, but it wasn't very satisfactory because there were new technologies coming along like radar or whatever. Like the polymerase chain reaction in molecular biology. These things come along and radar didn't come out of variations of radio circuits. You could vary radio circuits til you’re blue in the face, you'll never get radar. Radar is a different principle.Similarly, the jet engine didn't come out of variations of air piston engines in the late 1920s. It's a different principle. So when I was thinking about technology, was there a theory of evolution for technology? It was pretty clear the Darwin's mechanism didn't work, but I began to realize that novel technologies, radically new ones like the jet engine or radar, come about usually from some human problem. How are we going to detect enemy aircraft, metal clad aircraft that are strong and carry a heavy payload of bombs coming from the continent to England if there's a future war?And so I began gotten to realize that novel technologies come along as combinations of previous technologies. Radar is a combination of something that can generate high-frequency radio waves. Something that can detect high frequency waves and possibly screens or cathode-ray tubes to show you a picture of what's happening. There's a lot of parts to radar, and those parts, somebody realizes, or maybe some group of people over several years or maybe over several months, realizes that there might be a principle, maybe we can bounce high frequency waves off an aircraft 30 miles away and maybe we can detect the faint echo of those radio waves. That was known as a phenomenon as far back as the early 1900s.What wasn't known is, could we use this to detect enemy aircraft? And so people began to realize all we need to do is generate high frequency waves, point it in the direction of the aircraft, switch it off for an instant, which is not easy to do, so any echo comeback is not drowned out by the outgoing signal, detect the new signal, process it and etc. So I began to realize that all new technologies are combinations of technologies that had gone before and when I realized that I started to look in the literature and I found that wasn't a new thing to say. That people in the 1930s had said novel technologies are combinations of prior art. In fact, this goes back to somebody in the 1880s a guy called Thurston who had written about steam engines and pointed out that all parts of steam engines were known and used in previous technologies and that new technologies were combinations.So when I thought of that, and I wasn't quite thinking of a book then, but I was thinking you could have the theory of evolution for technology that rested on the idea, not a variation but of combination. And then there'd be lots of combinations either put together mentally or put together physically or both. And many of them would be quite useless, but some of them would be for repeating use. And those combinations, like a jet engine or a radar device, could become new building blocks for yet further technologies.So in that sense, if you take all of technology together, the whole collection of technologies, millions of different technologies, some of which are not used anymore, many of which are, they're all available for further combination, for further technologies. It turns out this isn't a terribly deep insight but nor was Darwin's, but it was crucial. It's a bit like saying technology works a bit like a very strange Lego set. You make combinations and if they happen to repeat and be extremely useful, you heat those combinations, fuse them together and throw them back in the Lego set for yet further combination.And this was very unfamiliar to say the least. Although, people had thought of something like this before and what I did in that book, The Nature of Technology was work out the details of how such combination works. I had to figure out, where the new species, where the novel technologies come from, not just vaguely but in particular. And how did they diffuse through population, how do they in turn create something that we call the economy? You could say that no ecology exists. You might have 25 species in the Mojave Desert in some small local place. No ecology exists, but it's convenient to say they're part of a collective interacting set of things and we can call that ecology.Turns out that an economy is a bit similar, that if you have technologies and they're helping us get what we want to live with — it could be transportation, it could be food production — those technologies together produce something we call an economy. So rather than thinking the economy was producing technologies, it seemed to me just as useful to think that technologies were producing the economy and therefore the economy keeps changing. Because the technologies keep changing.I want to comment a little bit on this. I put this book out on this theory of evolution and by the way, it took me 12 years to write. And actually Darwin was a sort of beacon for me. Darwin's ideas came together very slowly between roughly 1832 and 1839. He'd been on the Beagle, on that voyage and he had done an awful lot of observation. It was clear that the Earth was old and that speciation had happened, but he couldn't figure out how. He borrowed the key idea from economics that was borrowed from Malthus, that if species were struggling to survive, then ones that were slightly better adapted to a changed environment would leave more offspring, would survive better.And so if you had variations that were better adapted, they would survive and persist until they could no longer interbreed with the original population. You'd have a new species. When I was looking at technology, I decided that I would study about 20 technologies and maybe a dozen of those extremely well. So I studied professional books on jet engines and I talked to the chief engineer of the Boeing 747…and I mean I talked to him, asked him about certain things. I studied the evolution of computation of steam engines, railway trains of packet switching. Of penicillin, a means to human purpose…of certain technologies molecular biology, like the polymerase chain reaction.And I read several books and I read biographies and I read lab notes on the laser printer, which was invented where I work at PARC. The ethernet. So it was a thrilling time. I did a lot of that study here in Santa Fe at St John's College library and I think I acknowledged them in the book, but a lot of that was done here at the Santa Fe Institute. And sitting for three hours every morning reading about technology. The strategy was simple. I didn't start with the theory of technology. I started with vague ideas, maybe combination was important and I read and read and read a bit like Darwin running around the Galapagos collecting beetles or looking at iguanas. And I kept reading until I started to see common patterns and I began to see that every technology had come into being as for some human purpose and as a combination of what had gone on before and what was used before, and then it joined the Lego set and things could go from there.The interesting thing is that means the economy is open-ended. There's no finish to technology. There's more and more of it and I do think it's moving rather faster because we have more means devoted to that purpose. Doesn't mean people are thinking faster, and doesn't just mean there's more to combine with. It means there's more resources going into that. Not just DARPA or government, not just Silicon Valley, but all over the world. Huge amount of work going into it.
13,Episode Details / Transcript Brian: The strategy was simple. I didn't start with the theory of technology. I started with vague ideas, maybe combination was important and I read and read and read a bit like Darwin running around the Galapagos collecting beetles or looking at iguanas. And I kept reading until I started to see common patterns and I began to see that every technology had come into being as for some human purpose and as a combination of what had gone on before and what was used before, and then it joined the Lego set and things could go from there.The interesting thing is that means the economy is open-ended. There's no finish to technology. There's more and more of it and I do think it's moving rather faster because we have more means devoted to that purpose. Doesn't mean people are thinking faster, and doesn't just mean there's more to combine with. It means there's more resources going into that. Not just DARPA or government, not just Silicon Valley, but all over the world. Huge amount of work going into it.Michael: It seems like a strong parallel in the way that you felt you needed to expand upon and elaborate a sort of Darwinian thing with the way that this was actually going on at the same time in evolutionary biology. In the exposition of the importance of horizontal gene transfer, plasma transfer, sexual recombination, endosymbiosis, and that the more we elaborate a post Darwinian sort of extended evolutionary synthesis, the closer the dynamics of biological evolution get to the dynamics that you've elaborated for technological evolution.Brian: Yes, that's correct. I'm not a biological expert here. I'd put it maybe in simpler terms. What I would say is that for a great deal of evolution, Darwin's mechanism does a very good job variation and selection and then eventually that speciates. So we get new species. Fair enough. But every so often in biological evolution, combination plays a role. It does with the Archaea, it does at a very fundamental level. There's horizontal gene transfer. I understand it does to some degree in Bacteria and it does with the rise of the eukaryotic cell. That's combinations somehow that invaded a simple cell. And I'm glad to say that I met and knew Lynn Margulis and I knew John Maynard Smith and I'm good friends with Eörs Szathmáry, who these are all... I'm name dropping, but it's not so much for the sake of name dropping. I find it very important in science to know the people who've had the ideas for very simple reason. You realize they're human beings.I met John Maynard Smith in the Arctic, way in the North of Sweden. I realized that he had been an aeronautical engineer. These are things that help in the... Somehow they help in the realization that they're just normal human beings and maybe... And you're a normal human being and maybe there's hope for you to do something.Brian: I'll tell you a story about John Maynard Smith if I may.Michael: Please, yeah.Brian: Use it or not. But it's kind of fun. So I think the year is 1995. We're sitting in a weather station, a couple of 100 miles North of the Arctic Circle, a little place called Abisko. And it's a conference on evolution. And I knew John Maynard Smith was part of the small group of 20 or so of us. He hadn't appeared and then the door opens and in walks this older man with longish hair, gray hair and I could tell he was English because wore National Health glasses. And I made an awful lot of inferences, Sherlock Holmes style. Probably, he's been very left wing. Probably, he went to Oxford, probably socialist, because it's a type and I recognized him immediately. I liked him. Lovely person. He started to lecture on the major transitions of biology and then, being quite English, he says, "Now we come to rather a puzzle." He says, "We have to ask, why is there sex?”And so I'm sitting there, this is not something I know much about in biology. "We have to ask why is there sex? After all," he says, "Sex might be good for the species as a whole, but not necessarily good for the individual." I'm from Ireland. I stuck my hand up and I said, "Isn't that very much an English view of sex?" He looked at me for the first time and he said, "Well," he said, "I can tell you're Irish. And at least in England we do have sex."Michael: Oh, I mean that gets at the whole issue of at what level are you coarse-graining the model, right? Because he was growing up in a time when the notion of multi-scale selection was very hotly contested. And so now to view an evolutionary process as something that's occurring at multiple skills simultaneously, this question of the origin of sex is very, very similar to the question that David Krakauer and Martin Nowak were writing about that brought me into this study of the evolution of intelligence more generally. Where does syntax come from? The idea that the sentence is an adaptation to the complexity of the environment reaching a point where it's no longer effectively described by single word utterances. That it's a way to route around an error catastrophe.And so, this notion of, as you talk about in The Nature of Technology, that each technology creates new opportunity niches. And so this is an example where it's like there's a top down effect generated by a domain or a technology on all of its sub-components. And sex and language and the recombinant strategy…Brian: Multi-cellular organisms.Michael: Yeah, that all of these things are seemingly a response to the increasing complexity of the environment that is endogenously generated by this expanding. You mentioned Stu Kauffman talking about the adjacent possible, that it's this “non-ergodic above the level of atoms,” in his language. This is this question of is it possible as it seems, from where I'm sitting anyway, that the reason that evolution of technology looks different to us is simply because it is the dominant evolutionary strategy at work on the planet now, now that we have accelerated this process as much as we have, that we went through these periods, where either regulatory structure of a complex organism inhibits that recombinant innovation from within the organism. But then you get sex and then you get social learning and so on.Brian: What was the question again, then?Michael: I don't know. That's just sort of a fanboy, like, "What do you think of this?"Brian: But I think overall, and pulling back a little bit from the particulars here, I realized... Let me say something that's not particularly modest here. After all, this is the Santa Fe Institute. I realized that there might be are or there were two mechanisms in evolution that were quite different. One was standard variation and selection, certainly there'd be mutations or re-combinations and some sort of genome maybe shuffle a little bit and there'd be variations, as Darwin told us. The other mechanism I decided to call combinatorial evolution. Again, a label I arbitrarily stuck on this area in my book. And that would be that individual pieces or parts, whether this is in technology or indeed in parts of mathematics even. Think of things like theorems — new theorems are constructed by combining old ones with syntax and mathematical logic and grammar. To give new statements that might be proofs or conjectures even. Or in biology, as you were talking about a moment to go to all these different levels.And so there was a second mechanism. And the second mechanism is that existing parts and some or other can combine. And then some of those combinations, one or two, turn out to be successful. And so that combination then is encapsulated and becomes a new element. For example, gene sequencing, the time of Sanger and people like that 50 years ago or more, to sequence the blueprint for protein-like insulin would take days and it would take multiple labs and it would take all kinds of equipment. Now gene sequencing has become an element that is used in other technologies, such as forensic DNA policing and things like that, and now it's encapsulated in fairly small pieces of apparatus that maybe you could purchase for a high school lab or something like that. So I began to see this again and again.The bottom line here is that I wrote all this in The Nature of Technology. Oddly enough…people were interested in that book because it was a different way to think about technology. But oddly enough, there's been a bit of a silence around combinatorial evolution. Some people picked up on it and ran with that ball. Others didn't. The region of the world that's most intensely interested in technology and in that book, The Nature of Technology, is China. It's sold three or four times as many copies as here in English. It's now into its second edition. And I think that the reason is that China sees its path forward as being technological and it's hungry to learn how Westerners think about technology.My comment is that technology has always been a little bit of an orphan or ugly sister, or I should say maybe a Cinderella, in the sciences. We take it for granted. We use it to get us to the Moon. We use it in cell phones or in scientific instruments. But we don't wonder too much where it comes from, how it operates or how it evolves over time. And that was what fascinated me. My book has certainly stirred an awful lot of interest. But given that technology is extraordinarily important for the way we live, we certainly couldn't live without it, be it medical or housing or anything else. I'm surprised that there hasn't been more interest in the whole subject of technology.Michael: Yeah, certainly. Let me just say as a counter example, intensely and lifelong curiously, passionately interested in this, and in large part because the question of combinatorial evolution, this area seems to suggest to me that there is a generalizing framework, within which the evolution of technology, the evolution of biology, can both be understood within a general theory of intelligence. And David Krakauer talks about this, he talks about the isometry of, the congruence I should say, of the equations for evolution and for inferential learning. And how you think about this in terms of, as you discuss, all technologies are made from parts that are just already lying around, and that they're a response to a need, which... We had Jennifer Dunne on the show and listening to her talk about how food web relationships, the structure of trophic networks are conserved, from the Cambrian explosion to today. It's the same. The parts change, but the metabolism seems to be the same.And so, this question of when you talk about a technology as something that is created to serve a purpose, to address a need, it raises this question of like, "Well, okay, wait a minute, back up. What is a purpose here?" Because we exist within a situation where we have... Like you said, you can't invent the same things a hundred years ago that you can invent today. You place the same person in both periods and you get a different result. And in some sense, the purpose and need seem, to me anyway, to be properties of the network that we exist in, rather than understood as properties of the individual. You make a good case for this in this book. You use the term originator rather than inventor because the origin stories are just painful oversimplifications of how these things come out of these distributed processes. And once again, I'm just sort of lobbing this one at you, but do you see these as ultimately commensurable from the perspective that intelligence may be usefully re-understood as a distributed phenomenon?Brian: Yeah. There are two different things I picked up here. One is where to human purposes come from, or where does the need for technology come from? If you're an economist, you'd say, "I can understand how technologies got supplied, but where's the demand for them?" Turns out that nearly all the technologies, well over 90% is my guess, come into being for the sake of other technologies. So things like, oh, I don't know, a radar duplexer, it's a circuit that switches off a radar machine instantaneously for maybe a few thousandths of a second, so that there isn't a blast of radio waves and you can detect a faint echo. That was needed for radar. Et cetera, et cetera, many things are needed for jet engines or for computers. So, technologies demand further technologies and occasionally we've our own demands as humans. If you discover something like Ebola, then that automatically sets up a demand for something like a vaccine to deal with Ebola. So, occasionally it's direct human need, but most of the time technologies are brought into being to handle or manage or control or improve other technologies.The other question you brought up was understanding, or rather, intelligence. I preface it by saying that I don't know. I've read an awful lot of the psychology but I wouldn't claim to be an expert here. So let me just point out one thing: if you are educated in mathematics, and definitely I was for many, many years, up to master's degree level in my case, what struck me was that what you're actually being taught is concepts that are defined in terms of other concepts. So, you might have elements that might be digits or something, you can put them in rows and columns and you have a concept called a matrix. And then with that concept you can say, "Oh, we could do addition," which is a concept, or subtraction or multiplication. And you're shown how to do that with matrices. But all the time you're building larger and larger structures out of simpler ones.And I began to realize, and I haven't thought about this and this might be a good thing for you or David to think about who understand a lot more about this, I began to realize that much of understanding works this way. You're building novel concepts out of previous concepts. You do it in a wordy way, so a concept such as Munich, which means “government sell-out for purposes of appeasing some unsavory character,” that's a concept. You can encapsulate that in one word, then you can use that in other concepts too. And so it seemed to me, I don't want to be too much empire-building here, but it seemed to me that this idea of evolution by combination applies quite broadly when it comes to building up concepts from previous ones or mathematics from simpler mathematics and looking at every different structures this way.Also, I'm fascinated once you have such a toolbox, you can use it instantaneously in many ways. So if you have words, you can combine those endlessly and infinitely to formulate different sentences. Some of the sentences may have been uttered before, "I love you," or something that probably we could reduce that to say number 23 or something, and save ourselves a lot of emotion. In fact, it was von Humboldt said that language was infinite use of finite resources, so that you're combining and recombining things out of this toolbox. But the toolbox itself grows by using simpler objects to create more complicated ones, encapsulating those and you keep going. It's something that I think has been glimpsed here and there before, but I don't think it's been seriously written about. Not yet.Michael: So, in your example that you just gave about Munich, the way that language trends towards shorthands. Or in mathematics, these complicated conceptual structures get condensed into simpler. To back out a little bit into the philosophy of science, Mark Buchanan wrote a really great article for Nature Physics a while back about the natural bias for simplicity that Jessica Flack shared on Twitter. The Occam's razor thing is as simple as necessary, but no simpler, right? So we see this in intellectual systems, technological systems, biological systems, that there is a fusing of regulatory elements, a trending towards greater efficiency, but efficiency within the context of adequate modeling of the environment, actually serving a purpose for which it was created.I think about that, to make a transition into your McKinsey piece, that one of the things that when we ask this question about what does a need, I had Melanie Moses on the show and a lot of her work was done on scaling and biology, she and I talked about vascularization. And that seems to be, when you say 90% of new technology is in the components, that that's really 90% of your vascularization is in the capillaries, and so on.Brian: That’s right.Michael: And so that would again suggest that what we see as the necessity, the necessity that an invention fills, is driven by this global process of maximal entropy production and that we get to a point where, much like we saw in biology, that the organisms get so big and so dimensional that they're no longer efficient at the production of biomass. And then we have to come up with new structures to distribute the nutrition and the oxygen and so on through the body. This was glaring at me this morning when I was reading your piece on McKinsey about the future of the economy, and this movement from production to distribution. And so I’d love to hear you unpack, why is it you think that this transition is happening right now? What is the big economic shift that we're living through and what does it mean for us?Brian: Yeah, okay. I think the article I wrote in 2017 in McKinsey Quarterly, it was called “Where Is Technology Taking The Economy?” And when I look at what I meant by technology there, I certainly don't mean social media or cell phones, I was really talking about AI or machine learning or these a collection of digital technologies, and where's the economy going with that? I want to give two answers or two conclusions I came to. One is that practically all of these advances in AI, all the ones I can think of, are really nothing much more than associations, so that if I've a camera and I am in an airport and get my picture taken, and the algorithms, whether they're neural nets are using deep learning or some other thing, those algorithms are making an association between the elementary pixels and they process and process them until they can associate them with one person based on a lot of measurable criteria.And so language translation by machine is an association. I give you a sentence in Mandarin, you feed it into your computer. The computer looks through all sorts of similar sentences and associates it with one of those. It doesn't use very much grammar or syntax or anything. It's a real clunker, but it spits out the sentence it's learned to associate with something very close to the original. So these are all associations. We can recognize faces, we can translate speeches, we can recognize voice and so on. That's as far as we've got.What I want to say is what we haven't got yet, as far as I know, we haven't got a machine that can read characters, say like Wind In The Willows or something, some classic book, and understand that. We haven't quite figured out what it means to understand that. But my guess that understanding what we call reading is not just associating a sentence with some picture. A phrase from poet Keats is, “moss'd cottage trees," and I think he's describing paths through the woods in autumn or something. But immediately anybody who speaks English has a mental picture of that. But you don't get full understanding unless you know a huge amount of context. You'd have to have been in some woods, maybe in England. You'd have to know what a cottage looked like and not just that I can associate cottage with some other word in German or in French or something or Cantonese. In other words, machines don't yet understand in some way that we would be happy to call something a bit like human understanding.Anyway, so the first part of my answer is that we've developed a lot of technologies that are super good at recognition and they can do practical things. For example, technology might be a little bit of a forklift truck with a three-dimensional camera on it and connected to a computer that has sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms. The forklift truck goes automatically into some little pick-up warehouse place, sees all these cardboard boxes. It can read the labels somehow and it knows to pick up those boxes and load them into that truck and other boxes and load them into a different truck. And it sees some orange crates and recognizes that those are not cardboard boxes, et cetera, et cetera.So we've become very good at this. And in turn, what I'm realizing is that — this is not a very original thought, this next thought — economists have realized that machines, computers, algorithms in particular, some digital machinery is getting rarely good at figuring out things that we thought only humans could do. This is a huge surprise. We thought, as recently maybe as 15 or 20 years ago, that's computers would be very good at logic and good at arithmetic and accounting and figuring out engineering solutions, but would never be good at recognizing cardboard boxes strewn on the floor, or people's faces. Now they can do things that humans can do and that's causing jobs, I think, to be replaced. And that's not controversial in economics. There are other economists, thinking of Andy McAfee and [Erik] Brynjolfsson at MIT, but many other economists have noted this and written about it and thought about it.Where is technology taking us? We're entering an era where these digital technologies are bringing into industrial use applications that previously only humans could do. We can sort things by label. We can sit down and talk to a client in a bank to figure out would they qualify for mortgage. Now that can be done algorithmically and almost instantaneously. And so economists, I'm on been pretty firm ground here, or largely agreed that many, many jobs are getting replaced and will be replaced almost inevitably by digital means, digital algorithms, digital machinery. And so the big question that economics is, will there be new jobs? And that's really where the controversy is. It's not the jobs are disappearing, and instead what's going to replace these jobs? Nobody's quite sure.Meanwhile, almost a hundred years ago, 91 years ago, John Maynard Keynes wrote a famous essay, I think it was called “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren.” And it was looking roughly a hundred years ahead, which is close enough to where we are and he thought, and I think quite accurately, he thought there would be enough means, enough production to go around. He was talking about the UK, but he thought that what would have been called GDP or GNP at the time would be about eight times larger. Not too bad in estimate, roughly he's in the right ballpark I'd say. So we've plenty of goods and services and he thought there might be something he called technological unemployment. A few years before that, the concept of robots had been bandied about by a Czechoslovakian playwright. And Keynes wondered there might be robots then, and there certainly are. They're not standing up ones, but there may be machines like forklift trucks that are autonomous. And so there would be technological unemployment and what would that do to the economy? So my conjecture is thinking about Keyne's, thinking about artificial intelligence and automation and autonomous everything and the virtual economy, the digital economy. Putting all that together, I would make the claim that we're moving from an economy where the main issue, the main problem, is producing more goods and services into an economy where the main issue is access to the goods and services. The trough is large enough, how do the piggies share in it? Or will it be able to share in it?I don't have an answer to this. I think the answers would be complicated. But my observation is that we're now moving into a distributive era in the economy. We're not even that conscious of that yet, I don't think it's been said that much in the press. But that brings us into other issues. That reflects in politics all over the place, not just in America but in Europe and, in some degree, in China and Asia, where there's a feeling of unease about jobs, our ticket to the goods and services. We’re uneasy about that in general, especially if we're blue collar workers or white collar workers. And we might think we're not happy that machines are replacing us. We used to have an awful lot of offshoring or globalization, jobs going to China. Now jobs are going to the virtual economy and that's just like sending them to another country, and that means paychecks are going to that economy. They may be going to Amazon or Google, not to human beings.So there's a lot of unease, I think it's semiconscious, but on these, "How am I going to get by? How are my children going to get by?" We haven't had decades of wage growth like we used to have. We've had some wage growth but not reflecting economic growth. And so we're in a different ball game where this is not Kansas anymore. We're in a completely different game. Turns out that, in that game, economic efficiency is not important. We've tons of stuff to go around. So we will hear a lot less about sending jobs abroad or we'll hear a lot less about growing the economy and we're going to hear a lot more about jobs being created here and there, even if it's a trivial amount of jobs. We'll hear a lot less about trade deals, where it'll be efficient to make shoes in Mexico but not make them here. We're going to hear an awful lot more about why should we send jobs to Mexico when we can keep them here. And so questions of distribution are coming to the fore. That's already changed the game and politics, because all over the world there's a movement towards populism."I'll make sure you guys are okay. I'll make sure you're well supported. I make sure you have jobs if you just harken to what I'm saying. And I'll keep those awful foreigners out." And this is true in Hungary, it's true in Poland. It's the force, I believe, behind Brexit. We can't have all these farmers coming in. It's like what they used to say about the Irish in 1850. So we can't have all these people coming in. It's not racism, it's not prejudice, it's not even completely tribalism. It's more a semiconscious fear that we know there's enough to go around, but we're not quite sure we're going to elbow our way easily to get at this grand buffet that's possible. So the game has changed.Michael: That same kind of fear — to bring up a topic that that caused great amusement at the symposium this weekend. That same kind of fear's on display in like, "Okay boomer," versus, "Boomer pride." You know Jim Rutt's #boomerpride, hashtag?Brian: We're the guys who screwed it all up.Michael: I think that the racism, the populism, nationalism, does seem to come in at the point where fear starts to erode our ability to actually devote the necessary cognitive resources to understanding the complexity, the issue. And I really appreciate that in this article you talk about that the situation makes unbalanced free market philosophy increasingly indefensible, because what we're asking is really to view the economy as an organism or as an ecosystem. Then it does require an understanding of the trophic network. Ultimately, it seems like we're asking, “Are we human beings who have stumbled upon these…" I talked about this with Olivia Judson a few episodes ago, that she's looking at major evolutionary transitions as being catalyzed by the creation of new energy sources. And so the industrial revolution, in some sense, looks like we had all of the necessary pre-cancerous mutations just waiting for that blood sugar influx, that suddenly we can set things on fire and suddenly we've got internal combustion.But we're preloaded with all of our sugar obsession and this unilateral drive toward growth, but then what happens is, I feel like the question that we're wrestling with now as a species is, “Are we a tumor that is, the outer layer is alive, all of the billionaires are fine, but they're on a pile of skulls. You know? Or are we an organism where there is vasculature that gets into the core of the thing and it's not the growing edge, but you get into these Buckminster Fuller questions about whether job creation is even the right focus, or is the job specious?” And really what we're asking is just how do we provide for people. It's like a value shift.Brian: I like that way of looking at things. What I would say is that the issue is not jobs directly, it's really access to the economy. And jobs have been the primary means, but only for two or 300 years. In the middle ages we might be apprentice to some guild or you might be working for your family on a farm. There were quite a few jobs then, but now jobs are dominant. Maybe I'm the steel worker or maybe I've got a job interviewing people or whatever or figuring out what's going on with the economy. These are all jobs.What I would like to suggest, in fact what you just said, is that we should look at the problem not of jobs, but of access. I think it's almost inevitable that there will be a basic income, that had been suggested years ago by Milton Friedman, and it will start in Scandinavia or Germany, somewhat more progressive polities. The US doesn't like the whole notion of giving something away, but social security started here years ago, 70 or more years ago. I think there will be solutions like that. There may be solutions, there would be a lot of jobs, I think, created. Human beings doing something empathic with other human beings, advising or just sitting with older people or teaching kindergarten, maybe being part of a police force or whatever, where you have to really bring human skills.I'd say there'd be a lot more of such jobs and they can be compensated, but when there's enough to go around, being made by machines that are largely antonymous, that need a little bit of care and attention, but largely autonomous, that's not clear to me why we shouldn't have some sort of access to them.Let me put it this way. If there's a huge concert going on in Central Park in New York, whatever, Simon and Garfunkel, and it's repeating every day and it's there. Sure you can give out tickets and so on, but in the outer regions, why shouldn't people be able to take part in that or to listen to it? It doesn't cost very much to the rest of the people who are making money and having jobs. So, I think it's pretty well inevitable that we will have to redefine how distribution works in the economy. The good news is that a lot of the services that are being developed or produced, costs next to nothing. So you can have a mobile phone, a cell phone, and it costs very little and sending messages costs very little and emails cost next to nothing except a little bit of input of time and so on.So a large part of what we do in the economy, in the future, will have very low marginal costs. There might be an awful lot of public ownership or civic ownership of cars. A car shows up at your door and takes you to the airport and the marginal costs of that, because it’s operating all day and night, would be very low indeed. Et cetera. So I'm not hopeless, I don't think this is free loading. I think it's going to be a major regeneration of the economy and I think it's going to take somewhere between 20 to a hundred years, probably 30 to 50 years for us to work out some new system. That’s what it took in the Industrial Revolution from the 1850s to 1900s, to make work bearable. I think that's what it's taken in other systems, such as mass production comes along around 1900, 1910, but it's at least 1950, 1960 until it's taken for granted. You can own a car with very little effort and go wherever you please.So these things take decades. It's not a matter of Congress getting it. It's a matter of, really, experimentation and exploration and trying out different things and keeping an open mind. It's stupid to call this socialism. It's actually just, “How we're going to organize ourselves as human beings?” I think very good news is that all these technological changes we've had in the past, we've managed to adjust to their consequences, and I'm optimistic we will, by the way, with respect to climate change. This is just a conjecture, but I think that in the US we're getting close to a tipping point, among the public, from thinking climate change is not human-induced and not inevitable and not something you can do anything about, to thinking about that it probably is human-induced and it can be mitigated. The technologies are largely there already, and with the kind of will that went in The Second World War to defeating the Germans and defeating the Japanese, anything like that amount of will would certainly be very effective in the US or Europe or China as well.Michael: My last question for you involves this time horizon that you're talking about. Because these previous adjustments to major industrial changes, this happened in a world that was a much smaller population, a much less well-connected population than it is now. And the rate at which an idea can spread is, obviously, greatly accelerated from the way it was. But there are other effects; you get into increasing returns and lock-in and in your other work, how suboptimal solutions can dominate a network like this. And I'm wondering, because I don't want it to take 50 years, you know? I just had a kid, I'd like to make sure that she's not growing up in a world of the same anxieties that I'm growing up in. Do you see it as limited by people's ability to accept a new way of thinking? And if so, what do you consider are probably the most potent or empowering tools for spreading a new way of seeing that emphasizes the importance of the political dimension and the distribution of resources?Brian: Well, I tend to think that the limitation on all of these huge changes, say the realization of tobacco wasn't very good for our health, the century before that, the end of slavery and so on… I think that public attitudes are absolutely the key to making these large changes.Public attitudes are actually the key limitation. And with respect to climate, I think that's starting to change all over the world. Certainly from what I've seen in China and certainly from what I've seen in Sweden. I worked at the Swedish Academy of Sciences in their climates, the Beijer Institute.So the question really comes down to how could public opinion be changed? I don't know. I don't think government can do that much. Government tends to follow public opinion rather than lead it. I'm not trying to be cynical here. So I think what happens, in general in the world, is that some problem is perceived and then usually one or two events happen. So there's a problem perceived, say in the United States in 1936 that things are getting a bit out of control in Europe and that the Japanese Empire is expanding into the Pacific, maybe we should do something about it. But it's usually one or two triggering events, in that case Pearl Harbor. Immediately public opinion changed and immediately the government followed. The government didn't quite change public opinion, it was sort of both things instantaneously. And immediately then, within 18 months, the US economy had completely changed to take care of what was going to be a lengthy war and the resources were wheeled up.There's no amount of Al Gores or people showing up, Greta Thunbergs, these are all necessary people and I salute them, but it's actually slowly, slowly, slowly people realize we've had more hurricanes than we want. California, in the fall, seems to be perpetually on fire. Where I work, they give out gas masks and so on. Do we really need this? And finally there's, I think, a tipping point, but usually it takes one or two major incidents. And I don't wish climate horrors on anybody, but I think unfortunately that's the way it's going to be. There'll be some horrible stuff happens and suddenly public opinion will change.I was in this country a long time ago, in 1967, when the Vietnam War was raging. I was newly in the country and everybody I talked to supported the Vietnam War. One year later, hard to find anyone to support the Vietnam War. The Tet Offensive had happened. Robert McNamara and others had publicly come out against the war so intellectual leadership suddenly was against the war and the country flipped on a dime. After that, the war was still there, it had to be mopped up, but the will to fight it disappeared and the will to do something about it got very strong. So I have faith in America. I'm not commenting on whether this was good or bad for Vietnam or America. I'm just saying that once America decides it's had enough of something, more quickly than other countries, it flips.Similarly with the end of communism. I was in a hotel in the Irkutsk in 1989, and my roommate in the hotel was a mathematician from East Germany. And I said to him, this was in Soviet Union, I said, "I said Hungary and Czechoslovakia and Poland have all gone over to a different system, when do you think that will happen in East Germany? Will it happen?" He said, "Oh yeah, it will happen." He said. September 1989. ”That will happen," he said, "but not in my lifetime, but it will happen." And I think it was two or three months later the Berlin Wall came down.So these things appear to be impossible and somehow there's a complete flip. It's not because we're all sheep, it's really because it's not safe to express a different opinion. So I think one day, Mitch McConnell's... I'm an immigrant so I should shut up. One day, I think Mitch McConnell or somebody's going to come out and say, "Hey look, we need to clean up this mess," and completely unembarrassed by having had the other opinion, because suddenly it's safe to say so.Michael: So I guess when it comes to technological unemployment and basic income, the key is to just not be under the avalanche when the sand pile comes down, right? Maybe, looking forward just a few years, now's a good time to not be a truck driver. And then you might be able to…Brian: Yeah. I think that we're going to have to socially invent solutions. That's not generally done by governments. Sometimes they have a hand in it, but usually it's proposed by private citizens or politicians or doctors, in the case of 1850s suffragists and other people saying, "We need to treat shift workers much better. We need to look after their health. We need to mitigate the dangers in the workplace." These are proposed, make their way into the polity, and they're discussed. It doesn't usually come from government. It could start in some small place. Many experiments are done and then it appears totally obvious. And we've been doing that all along. In California we've done that for a hundred years. It may be true, but you know an idea has arrived when other people are claiming that they've done this for decades themselves.Michael: Yeah. I'm sure the Santa Fe Institute will be out there in the streets claiming priority when the day comes. Brian, it's been such a pleasure. This has been a fabulous conversation. I'm very grateful that I've had two whole hours to sit down with you.Brian: Great. Superb questions.Michael: Thank you so much.Brian: And I'm really glad it wasn't just that you understood what I was saying. I was trying to understand what you were saying in biology.Michael: Aw, thank you.
14,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Maria, it's a pleasure to be joining you amidst the complexity here.Maria: Thank you very much for having me, Michael. Thank you very much to SFI for inviting me here.Michael: Yeah. So, I'd like to... Before we dive into the details of your work, this is... I think you're the youngest person we've had on the show here, and this is a really great opportunity to ask you some questions, as a young scientist, about your early career work, and how you got into the field. I'd love to know what drew you into your study with Doyne Farmer, and into the discipline more generally.Maria: Yeah. So I did my bachelor's in physics, but I have to say, when I was in high school and I was deciding what to study, I considered physics or psychology. I went for physics, because people told me it would be easier to switch afterwards. But I think the psychologist and the curiosity for human behavior never stopped at me. I loved physics. But towards the end, and even at the beginning, I sometimes felt the world needed a bit more economic solutions, that it needed physics solutions. So, I wanted to do a PhD, and I literally Googled “physicist economists.” I like the UK, so I Googled there. I found Doyne Farmer, and I started reading about him, and thought, “This guy's amazing.” I read about... and I actually saw the documentary of him playing roulette.Michael: With the shoe computer?Maria: Yes. It was like, that's amazing. I'm the type of person that could never tie an electric circuit. But seeing that, I was like, “Oh!” I was inspired in some way. The way he says we can predict the economy or we can understand it, and we have to get our models, make them empirical, go to the data and show it works… For me, it showed how the future of economics should be, and I wanted to be part of that. Yes, I guess I just wanted to contribute to the world, and I felt the only way was if our models, which I mean scientific models, agent-based modeling in particular, were backed empirically. So I wrote Doyne an email. He replied, he said, “I'm going to Mexico.” I met with him, had a great conversation, end of story. I applied for the PhD.Michael: Right on. So you spoke at the annual symposium that we held this weekend on New Complexity Economics and made a very strong case, although to a very sympathetic audience, for the role of agent-based modeling in economics. I'd like to hear you unpack that a little bit for people that are not familiar, because the audience to this show. I know there're a lot of experts, but there's also a lot of people that are new to these ideas. Talk a little bit about the value of a data driven approach and agent based modeling in economics, and why it is that you've cleaved to these methodologies.Maria: Because I think it's intuitive. Because I think agent based models relates to how we see every life. Every person is independent and does decisions. The thing is, you'd like to see that in an experiment sort of way, like us in physics. But you can't do that. For example, Rob Axtell said, well once you have a policy simulator, you can run hundreds of scenarios. Standard economics, they start with some actions, rational agents for example. Those actions lead to an equilibrium where supply equals demand. The way they think is... Well, many economists think, and even some physicists doing economics, how do we deviate from this equilibrium? But it's focusing on the end rather than on the trajectory. That's the point I believe mostly in, that we should focus on how the economy's evolving and not where it should be, because the reasoning behind that is, well it should be an equilibrium because, if it wasn't, there will be this force, this invisible hand that will put it back in there.But, as many complex systems scientists say, if we're at equilibrium, we’re dad, and I think that's the one thing we know about society. We're not all dead. We're quite alive. That agent-based model is focusing on the dynamics, on the evolution, and it's the thing you see too in everyday life. Now, I think we're at the point where economics can start developing in a different way. Why? I believe the recent economics started with this action axioms and these theorems was because it was so hard to get data to experiment, to see that your ideas were true. Then, it might be a bit easier and even useful, when you can do it, to just lock yourself out and just think rationally, think logically. “If A and B happens, then do you get C?” And actually, math is beautiful. I love math. But then the thing with math is that, once you prove something, you know it's right, and that's beautiful, and that can be, in a way, addictive. You get addicted with playing the game of math, but you forget if your actions, if your assumptions, match the real world.But we couldn't do much because it wasn't easy to observe the economy. We could see how we shop, et cetera, but you wouldn't record all those transactions. But now I think now the world is changing, and now we can say, I believe the world behaves in this way. I do my agents, I put them some behavior, and I can calibrate their behavior with real data. For example, we can see now, in general, if you have one occupation, what's the likelihood you get unemployed? What's your average wage? Those things let us know how agents might be able to behave. Your wage might define your consumption patterns. So, now we can actually observe the world and we can test if our ideas, if our models are correct. I think that's the new way to view the economy, where we have to be very strong in our models, but we have to bring them through the data. If they fail, we know we're wrong, and then we try again until we get it. Because I think we owe it to the people. I think the economy is something important.One of the quotes I learned the IMF when I was at Christine Lagarde’s talk, and one of the things she said was, “people before numbers.” That stuck to me. That's the one thing I want to do when I do economics. I always doubt myself. I doubt my models, and I think, as a scientist, we should, and the only way to be a bit more sure about it is to bring it to the data.Michael: So I'd like to talk about two of the papers that you coauthored, and I think that they're very intimately related, but the one I'd like to get to first is about looking at the labor realm through a network map, a network model. This is a paper that you wrote with Penny Mealy and Doyne Farmer: “What you do at work matters: new lenses on labor.” So, I think most people have general intuition that the skills that you learn in one job sort of change the possibility space for you if you're going to move to another job. But this paper really looks at this in a very granular way, and in a way that, like you just said, would not have been possible in an earlier period of scarcer data. So, could you unpack this a little bit? How did you actually set up this model, and what did you find?Maria: Right. Yes. Great phrasing of it. I think the way it started is with the conversation with Penny. Penny was the driver of this paper. Penny's a great scientist, and she knows a bit about economic... Well, she's probably one of the people that knows most about economic complexity. She had this idea that you could see how similar two occupations were depending on what you do at work. So for example, a paramedic and a nurse might be similar because they do stitches, they care to wounds, in the same way that a taxi driver and a bus driver might be similar. Based on the idea of economic complexity, you can define a network of occupations where they are linked. These links are weighted by the similarity between them. We defined similarity as the amount of work activities they share, but some normalizing factor.So, when I was talking to Penny and she mentioned this to me, it seemed like a great idea. I knew a bit of networks, so we started working. Then it comes this thing that always comes out when you work with Doyne. You have this idea, and he thinks, “Yes, I think that's true, but let's test it.” So how do you test if it's true that two occupations are similar? What we thought it would be is, “Well, let's look at data on job transitions. If it's true that two occupations are similar, then maybe you can see if they're similar enough for one person to switch from one job to another.” That's what this paper focuses on, and we managed to show that there is some relation. There is actually more relation to other networks. So there's, for example, Own It has this career changer network where they suggest to you other occupations, and we actually managed to beat this in a way.So, we showed that this network is in some wa, predictive of how people can transition between occupations. When we saw that, we saw... I think that's when you know that, okay, the ideas of how you see the world actually have some sense in reality.Michael: So, there's two very interesting maps that we'll link to in the notes for this episode. One is the “job space network,” and then the other is the “work activity space network.” You already mentioned that a lot of this has to do with the energy, or time, or attention required in re-skilling the way that these cluster out. But, looking at this, it's beautiful how this sorts into... It seems so similar to the questions of evolutionary possibility based on the anatomy of the organism, and then whether a new niche that's opened up can actually be populated by the organisms in that ecosystem or not. I don't know. So I'd love if... Sorry, I have a way of branching into tangents here, but as part an effort to create bridging analogies and generalizations, what do you see as the sort of general insights of the job space and work activity space networks? At a very deep layer, what are we actually looking at here, energetically or informationally? What is governing these geometries?Maria: Oh, that's a lovely way to put it. I wish I had thought about it more that way. So I might... I'll speak from here hypothesizing. So, these are ideas I haven't tested or we haven't tested, but I think it's beautiful the way you put it, to look at it as an evolutionary perspective. The way you might see it is as if occupations were sort of different... Well, actually “species” is not the correct term, but there were organisms, let's say, with different phenotypes. So they're the same species, let's say, but they have different colors or different features. You're able to jump from one to the other between generations. Here, the analogy would be between re-training. Then the thing that would be amazing to study is how this changes, because the way you could see it is, occupations are in an ecology. The ecology is to remind the demand affirms what do they want. So for example, a lot of people right now are asking for things related to data and statistical analysis. So, in a way, the environment is changing and the organisms have to adapt. So you'll probably see organisms or occupations... Well, the organisms in the occupations, which you can say the population of one occupation moving towards, moving to adapt to this new landscape.When it comes to work activities, I see that more of the characteristics of the people, what things you can do, the skills. Then, if they're close together, it means... I would say it means it's like when you have one gene, you're more likely to have another gene. There's some correlation between genes. In the same way, maybe if you're good at painting, you're good at sculpture, while if you're good at solving math equations, you might be good at coding, things like that. So it's, let's say they're genes that might be correlated in this sort of ecosystem that I'm not even sure I defined the correct way, but I would venture and put it that way.Michael: So, one of the useful insights that emerges from this network analysis is the demographic distribution of labor. I'd love to hear you speak about that. The way that looking at this helps to explain certain persistent issues in the labor market with the availability of certain kinds of work to certain genders or education levels, or these kinds of things. So what do you think precipitates out of this? How is this generative of useful insights to policy makers or employers or educators? How can we use this to shed light on the ways that we are failing to provide opportunities for people, or what other insights spilled out of this for you in that regard?Maria: Yes, when you see the pictures, you see this network, and then upon this network of occupations, we plotted things like education, and you see they're clustered, differently. You see things like wage. We also plotted the gender, and it's also split, but it's split in different ways. So, in a way, you can see a clear cluster of, let's say, high wage and low wage. If you put a gender on top of it, you sort of split it in four, which would be high wage female, high wage male, low wage female, low wage male. So it tells us that... Well, first thing, wage is driven by many things, but one of them is demand and supply. So in a way, when you see this plot and you see low wage in one place and high wage in the other, if you wanted to make it more homogeneous, what you'd say is the people, the occupations with high wage means they're difficult to reach. It means it's difficult for people to have those skills. So, the policy there... and this might be over-simplistic, but what first comes to mind is teach the skills in those occupations, because you're saying it's scarce. That's what drives wage. People cannot do that as easily.Well, the little skills you'd say, well maybe I don't have to focus that much on it. When it comes to gender, for example, that's a bit more complicated, let's say, because is it good for people to split in genders that split occupations? I would say no, but economically I'm not sure if there's a reason behind it. I think that one is more interesting to understand what causes it, and it's one of the things that I'd like to build a model to explain this pattern. I think the big question is, is it genetics or is it cultural? My personal opinion is its cultural. I don't think women and men are born totally different and that determines if you want one occupation or the other. I think it's more cultural. But I think this is a way of thinking back and saying, well what makes her culture tell women to thrive in some occupations, in men in others. So I think those are the questions I might be interested in.Michael: What surprised you about this research?  Looking at these correlations, did anything pop out to you as counterintuitive?Maria: Yes. So I would say there wasn't anything too surprising from this work. Some of the things were intuitive. The fact that there's a clustering and there's high wages and low wages is intuitive to daily life. But there were some red alerts, and some of the red alerts include, for example, that occupations with high wage have low problem of being automated, and also do not tend to be very pollution intensive. Low wage tends to be automate-able and tends to be pollution intensive. So if you think, this ecosystem is evolving, and it's evolving towards adapting to climate change and will reduce the low polluting occupations, and will automate some occupations… This is a warning sign that says, well, if the jobs are going to remove our already low wage, that just gives a bit of a warning. I think that was still something that struck us, and when we saw out we were like, yeah, I think we need to go deeper.Michael: It should come as a surprise to no one that we're talking about the low wage jobs that have the highest exposure to the risk of automation are the majority of this map. So it gets into this question that comes up on the show a lot, which is, in situations where this seems like it might be the symptom of increasing returns in the network, positive feedback, at some point, the whole thing empties itself out. You get into these economic questions of, there's the anecdote of the labor union coordinator and the car manufacturer walking through the plant, and he's saying, “Look at all these great new robots. They don't sleep, they don't complain, they don't strike.” Then the union leader says, “Well yeah, but they don't buy cars.”So this tails into this other paper on which you're the lead author about automation and occupational mobility. So building on this understanding, looking at the network as a way to understand how people can transition through periods of change in the labor market. I'd like to hear, if you want to lay out a little bit about the thinking behind this piece and how you decided to dig into the data, and what data formats... How this piece methodologically differs from the piece that we just discussed.Maria: Yeah. So as you say, in a way, the previous paper led into this one with those red alerts. We need to dive into those. We need to understand it? When we started with Penny seeing these red alerts, we wanted to see if we could do something more. The thing is we thought... Well, we think agents adopt, and hey move. As you say, we're not static. So could we include that in the model? So, do you think... Well, we think labor is important because it has had an impact in history. So you can see from... If you go to the medieval cities or cities that have medieval backgrounds in Europe for example, in Brussels, underground plaza, you'll see guilds, and in the guilds it, there were these institutions where, if you wanted to be a fisherman, you had to be affiliated to the guild.Now, this was a way for the guild to keep track of how many fishermen they were and not assign too many. Because, if you have too many fishermen, you have a lot of supply of labor, and then wage goes down. By the way, this was also a way to control how many women or how much women could work. So it's funny how labor goes back all the way. You can think also of Jim Crow laws, when there was all of a sudden an extra supply of labor. People started to think, well let's make a law that will separate people. If you go to today's politics, the ideas of the president of the United States, the ideas behind Brexit, tend to be about securing the scarcity of jobs. So making our skills scares. If everyone can do what we do, we're not going to get a high wage. So when robots can do what we do, we might be into trouble. That's how this started leading here.Now, what we did is we basically took previous research on some predictions of which occupations would be automated. Then we thought, well, people are not going to say, “Oh yeah I got automated. That's it. I'm unemployed, and I'm going to remain unemployed.” Yeah, I think they would fight back. How do they fight back? Well, we have data on job transitions. We have data that tells us where people move. So we thought, “Okay, let's build a model.” And we constructed... So the first thing is, we saw we cannot solve this only with data. As much as we like these maps that overlap, it wasn't going to give us the answer. We had to do a model, and we had to do a model that was based on what we thought was reality. So we thought, “What are the things that drive this?” Well, first there's some spontaneous process. People leave their job and new vacancies get open. That just happens just random, let's say. But then there's a force driving the economy. There's this landscape change. This is how the economy evolves that says, “Well, I'm going to push a bit and I'm going to make less vacancies, job vacancies, for taxi drivers and make more job vacancies in the healthcare system.”So there's was this other force that would push it towards a new prediction of demand. The prediction of demand, we got it with the automated ability of occupations. I have to say here, there's a major assumption. We assume, in a way, that the labor and demand stays constant. Why do we do this? Well, historically, there’s the Industrial Revolution. Automation is not a new thing. If anything, it's the only thing human has always done. We've always been through technology, but what happens is it's not that we get massive unemployment. It's more like some jobs are destroyed and new are created. So our hypothesis was, let's take the predictions of the automated ability and say the ones with a low automation probability are going to increase their demand. The ones with high automation probability are going to decrease it. On average, we're going to stay constant. The model can be flexible and can assume different levels, but that was the starting point.I have to say here, a caveat of this work, when we talk about automation probabilities, when Frey and Osborne and Erik Brynjolfsson, and [Mitchell and Raague?] put their predictions out there, it's the probability that it can be automated. It's not a probability that it will be automated. The difference is we might be able to make a robot for a waiter, but it might be just cheaper to pay someone. So, in that way, it won't be automated. But anyway, that was an assumption in the model. So, sorry. Recapping is some random fluctuations. This force that drives the economy towards new jobs, and then the adaptation of workers, and they transitioning between occupations.That's how the model works. Three simple rules. That's it. We put the shock, we let it run, and what we observe is how much unemployment changes in each occupation, and how much longterm unemployment changes. Because, in a way, it's not very bad if you're unemployed. We could take a break. Just kidding. It sucks, but it's not as bad as if you're longterm unemployed. If you've been unemployed for a year, that's when it really, really starts getting bad. So, that's the other measurement we took into account.What we saw in this model was that, for example, we take the example of childcare workers and statistical assistance. I like to say, if your nephew asks you, “I either want to become a childcare worker or a statistical assistant,”  you look at these automation probabilities. Childcare worker, not likely to be automated. Statistical assistant, likely to be automated. You might think, “Well, of course you should be a childcare worker. Then you're not going to be automated.” Your job is not going to be automated.Our results tend to hint otherwise. Why? The thing is, people are not only their occupations, they're their skills and, with their skills, they can transition. They can transition in this network. The thing is the statistical assistance might be automated, but they have skills that allow them to transition to other occupations that are growing in demand. Well, childcare workers might not be automated, but they're easy to reach. In a way, childcare work is something intrinsic to humans. So other people that may be automated might go for that occupation. Again, talking about demand and supply, that's why. And this is something that network reveals. It's not straightforward to say automate-able occupations are bad, sorry, are going to suffer. Non automate-able occupations are going to grow. But it's somewhere in between. And to see that concretely, we have to go to a network.Michael: So, it strikes me that this might be a useful lens to look back, like you kind of suggested a moment ago, historically, and understand why childcare has been basically invisible to the economy this whole time, that there is an abundance of... There's just so much supply on that end of the labor market that it's driven the economic value in the very rudimentary, coarse way that we have historically been able to evaluate that to a very low point. But then there's also... And I guess there's two things that you could address here. There's also the issue of, again, this map. When you talk about a disturbance to the network, changing the relative incentives that exist for someone within a given set of skills. What we're talking about here in the real world is not a kind of random bump to the table. It's endogenously generated. We were talking about this with Brian Arthur just recently, about the way that technology propagates new niches.So the ways in which things are being disrupted are definitely slanted in a particular direction towards the new affordances that are created by these spaces. So I'm curious: the obvious question is, how do you see the changes that we're seeing in the technological landscape now? What is actually opening up in terms of the possibility  space, and why? How do you think that that's going to change the weights that we assign to various skillsets?Maria: Interesting. So there's many things in that question. One is this system is... There’re feedback loops in the system, and it actually goes back to what you said about the beginning, about the person with cars and the labor unionists, and the labor union is saying, “Well, robots don't buy.” The thing is the economy has feedback groups. So what people buy and what they demand feeds into the network of firms, and those firms hire the workers. What I'm saying is, it's not a straightforward question because automation itself is going to displace workers that might change the demand for goods that will change the demand for labor. So it's an ongoing process. This work didn't focus that much... Well, doesn't focus on that. But for example, Matthew Jackson has a good paper on how the input-output network, which is this network of firms buying between each other, how it rewires, how it might rewire because of automation. So that's one thing, considering there's feedback loops and it's not that straight forward.Maria: The other thing is... I think your question was, “Where are we headed?” So stopping the detour, where are we headed? This is just hypothesizing. I do think we're headed... There's going to be an increase in health, in the health sector. If there's one thing people care about, it's health for their family, for their friends, and living longer. The longer we live, the more we demand on health. So, that's one thing that I think is going to grow.The other thing is analytical skills, being able to interpret the world. That's one driver. I think that's the positive scenario. It's the positive scenario because, and that might be my opinion, but I think those are work that we tend to value highly, because what we do as intrinsic to our value, and it's important for people to have jobs they have dignity with and they are proud of. It's important for people to be proud of their work, because it's eight hours a day. Okay? So we need people to be proud of it.So I think that's the good scenario: where we educate people on everyone does interesting jobs, does health, does science, and understands the world, ultimately. The bad scenario is where it actually, we have so many unemployed people. Well, as I said, it's not going to hit massive levels, but we have a lot of people whose skills is not compatible with the health and science and all of that. Then we say, well, it costs energy to pay to have a robot, but there's people willing to do it. So let's just pay a low wage to those people. That is actually a bit dystopic, because that that means we're going to split people into the ones that can do high skill and the ones that can do low skill. This is actually a bit related to what Harari says. So Harari puts this dystopia, right, that maybe some people are the ones that are going to be able to buy goods that will amplify our capabilities. So we're going to expand their memory. And he, for example, talks about blood transfusions that might enable you to live longer. So there's people that are going to be able to afford it and the people that cannot. That's going to create two types of humans in a way, and that's scary.I really hope we don't go that way, and I hope the way to ensure that is through retraining, because I think everyone can do a high school jobs if they receive the right education and the right motivation. I think that's the core of what this work is about. It's about job transitions. It's about what retraining do we need to get into, let's say, the steady state we want, the attractor we want. Well, in a way, we’re in the same attractor, but into the fixed point, or around the fixed point we want instead of the other. We have a choice. Well, I think we have ... I'd like to think we have a choice. Where are we going to push this system? Is that the one where everyone can go to where every job, because we have education or... Well, not every job, but to a job with dignity that is important to them. Or is it the other? I think that's where we need to really push for the science.Michael: Yeah. It seems that, when I zoom out and I take this absurdly large macro-evolutionary view of the history of the planet, and that there's this ratcheting through major transitions toward agents that are capable of better, more adaptable models, broader perspectives, very generally speaking, that the kinds of intelligence required by someone living today, much more abstract than the kinds of intelligence required perhaps 500,000 years ago. To zoom in again, there's an enormous spike that I'm observing just online in conversations around sense-making, and that it seems like this is where your work connects to the work of people like Jessica Flack, looking at society as a collective computation and where it connects to the work of people like Andreas Wagner, looking at shocking bacterial cultures with intense selection pressure, and how that accelerates the mutational search algorithm that you see that culture going through. It sounds to me like where your work links to these other people is in suggesting that there's a sort of...Just as economists say, if you really want to put a meta-investment down on something that's going to provide a diverse array of dividends, it's on education, it's on helping people learn to explore and adapt to a rapidly-changing world that, in important ways, cannot be anticipated. And so there's... I think I would like to remain hopeful that sense-making and creativity, that these are the things that we're going to move into naturally as a species. But I don't know. What do you think about that?Maria: Well, I'd say I'd like to be optimistic too. I love how you talked about organisms and computing as a whole, because I think that's vital. We're in an age where it seems to be okay to divide people into us and them. And that's not how we're working. We're actually working as one organism. Maybe it's a “bacterium,” and there's some external shocks, and we have to deal with it, but we also have the advantage that we communicate. Well, bacteria communicate in one way, but I think our communication is a lot more complex, though some people might not use the whole complexity. But yes, I think we need to remain hopeful. I think we need to think about the big picture, think about how the whole landscape is changing, and think about how we're going to adapt. And planning different strategies. Seeing, “Do we want to go this way, the other way?” Maybe we can understand that with bacteria. Maybe we can do some micro simulations. Maybe we can understand it in coding. Just doing an agent-based model and seeing what incentives you need to give.In a way, this is like control theory. You have one policy, or several, and you can play around with it. We need to hope that we do it the right way. Honestly, there may be many right ways. We just have to get… And that's a one thing I'm optimistic about. I don't think it's an Avengers-type of thing where Doctor Strange says, “There’s so many multiverses and we're only successful in one.” I think we actually can be successful in many ways. There's a lot of proposals. There is universal basic income, there is... Many countries have free healthcare. Many countries have free education. One way or another, all of those might lead to it. Another thing I'd like to mention is, when I say we need to start thinking of an organism as a whole, I mean the whole world. When I mean we need to make our models valid with data, I also mean the whole world, which means we need to push to have data for developing countries.I know SFI is a driver of those. It has groups of archaeologists going to different countries and collecting data. I think we need to push for that, because this is something that happens a lot in research. We want to publish in top journals. To do so, we need top data quality. Which countries have top data qualities? They're developed countries. Ironically, I'm a Mexican studying the labor market for the US. I would actually like to do it for Mexico, for Latin America, for a lot of other countries, but it is true that the US has the best data, or one of the top data [sets]. So I also think, as scientists, we have a moral obligation to look for that data. It's not only moral. It gives us more about science because it gives us different environments. We're one organism in different environments. How do we develop? Overall, I think science will win with this.So yes, I think my big picture is, we need to start seeing how do we get to the state that we want. How do we get together on it? We cannot forget about one part of the world because we're in a globalized world, so there's no way that's going to happen. And I am optimistic. As I said, I think there's many paths that can lead to it. I think we have the right intuition, but we have to... Paul Romer said it at some point, we have to decide. That's the one thing, we sort of know which are the policies we need for climate change. It's not totally clear, but we need some retraining. Well, let's decide. I think this... I would cite Romer, and say, at some point we have to decide, and that's going to be it.Michael: So, to bring this back down to the human scale and wrap it here, I'm curious: you're young, you're talented and intelligent, and relatively well-positioned in your career, and yet you spend every day thinking about the turbulence and the change, and the disruption that is facing us and will be facing us for the foreseeable future. So what insights have you taken from this and into your own life and how you imagine your lifelong strategy for navigating this? You are the node. You're sitting on one of those little islands in the network. So what does this mean for you, Maria, and how is it shaping the way that you plan and prepare for the rest of your life?Maria: Wow, that's a big question. I have to say SFI has played an important role. Doyne Farmer, Francois Lafond, a lot of people have .. Penny, have played an important role in this. They're sort of my guidance. Someone once asked me, because I'm one of those people that has always been like, “Oh, I think academia is what I'm going to do if I can.” They asked me, “How can you be so sure? I kind of don't believe people can be sure.” I said, “I'm not sure at all, but I know the things I can't do.” It's more about, I just know there's some things I cannot do and then there's only one path. Yes, in a way, every day I'm like, okay, I see the news and I'm like, “Oh, this might be going down,” but then I can't just go and solve the world. Maybe I should, but I don't see it in my adjacent possible. There's all this framework. What's adjacent and what's possible. And the one thing I can do is keep on working on these models, trying to make them better, hoping that...I do think sciences is brought up in a collective. So I think I just want to contribute little by little. I enjoy it. I like it. It has ups and downs. I'm not going to lie, I'm not a person that wakes up every day and says, “Oh yay, I want to go to my computer and started this coding and start doing the math.” No, there's days I'm like, “Oh God, I wish I could stay in bed.” Or “Oh God, I wish I could just go for a longer run or stay and chill out with friends.” It happens, but it's not everyday that I want to do it. But I'd say maybe one in five days, I wake and I say, “Yes, today I'm going to write these equations, and I'm going to see if they work.”Sometimes they happen consecutively, sometimes it's weeks that I'm like, “I have to do this.” Sometimes there's weeks that I don't want to do it. I still go to the office. In a way, it's still work, but I do love it, and I don't see another path. That's my personal view. I think different people find inspiration different ways. For me, SFI has been one way, and I'm not sure where I'm headed. It might be academia, it might not be, but somehow I'm optimistic that it's going to work, because it has to. If I don't think that, then I don't know how I'm going to wake up every day. But so far, so far so good. I'm enjoying it.I don't know. To all the PhD students out there, I think we all struggle, and it's part of the path. We also have to learn to enjoy the little victories, because there's going to be a lot of defeats, but there's enough good in this world to just go for it.Michael: I remember my friend Mark Nelson, who was one of the eight people that was locked inside of Biosphere II for two years here in the American Southwest. He said that hope is a form of yoga, and he said it was about remaining humble to the possibility that your models are wrong. So I like this, that you keep bringing up optimism because, in a way, I would make a case, I think, that optimism is actually humility to the possibility that your despair is mistaken. Anyway, Maria, this has been a pleasure, and I'm glad that you're doing this work. I imagine it will be very illuminating and helpful to a great many people, and situate you well for the numerous disruptions to come.Maria: Well, thank you very much. I also hope it helps some people, and yeah, thank you. Thank you to SFI. It's a great journey to travel so far.
15,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Andy Dobson, it’s a pleasure to have you join us on Complexity Podcast. What are you doing at SFI this week? What's your visit?Andy: This week we are in a workshop that's part of the 'hour of time sequence'. And so specifically we're looking at immunity and aging. Trying to understand how your ability to fight diseases or fight cells in your body changes as you age and my own particular interest, that is how species of different body size handle that problem.Michael: Yeah. Actually your work on scale as a variable in the primate disease paper, I thought that was an interesting thing. We'll touch on that. But first before we start I'd like to ask how you got into the research that you're doing, how you became a scientist and how you ended up working with diseases.Andy: I think I was very lucky in that I was playing in a rock group in London. I was actually starting a Masters in Oceanography in Southampton and I was having to hitch lifts up and down in the classic British pouring rain. So I thought it would be better to find a job in London. And I was lucky enough to start working with a brilliant scientist called Roy Anderson at the beginning of his career. And he, together with that Bob May, who has a long association with SFI were developing theory, a better theory for understanding the population dynamics of infectious diseases. So in order to live in London, I started working as Roy's research assistant and I just realized that was going to be so much more interesting than working as a musician.Michael: Well, in spite of some of the comments that you make in this paper on the Yellowstone wolf population, there's probably more stable funding as a researcher than as a musician.Andy: Not certainly the case. Any form of funding is never stable. But I think long term there's more funding, particularly when you get a faculty job that funding, knowing that you've got finances to at least put food on the table helps.Michael: So given that obviously universality and thinking across disciplines is a key theme here at SFI and on this podcast in particular, I'd like to start with some statements that you made in this paper for PLOS on Yellowstone wolves and the forces that structure natural systems. You made a really interesting comment that comparing the kind of theoretical work that you do to the kind of theoretical work that's being done at CERN and other physics institutions seeking these general principles. And I'd love to hear you discuss that a little bit and how you see those things as related to one another.Andy: Well, I do have immense respect for the work that's done in CERN and work that's done by physicist. I feel that the urgent problems we have, I try to understand how natural biological systems work and how can we take tools, particularly mathematical tools from physics and apply them to natural ecosystems. And straight away when we start trying to do that, we realize that they fit perfectly into the SFI mandate and the natural systems such as Yellowstone or the Serengeti are naturally complex. They have many components that interact with each other at different nonlinear speeds. So we need to develop the type of mathematics and approach that's used at SFI to understand these systems.Michael: Yeah. I like that you compare the search for the Higgs boson to trophic network research and the idea that really the main thing differentiating these two forms of research are the scale of the phenomena that are being explored. Can you get in a little bit more about that.Andy: Yeah. The physicists are very much focused on doing things at heroic scales. The scale of the universe or tiny, tiny little scales. So I think ecologists are tended to be perceived as not doing things that are heroic because we doing them on physical sizes that are similar to ourselves. Yet the irony of that is that understanding how those systems work and having a deeper theoretical understanding so as we can manage them better is crucial. As people like Greta Thunberg will tell us we have about 10 years to solve those problems. Whereas the wait for Higgs boson can go on for a century. It can go on if we haven't solved those problems of how we manage the natural world properly.Michael: I don't know if you would find this a fair line to draw, but I'm sure you're familiar with some of the work that Jessica Flack has been doing lately and her provocative comments, that rather than complexity of being a sort of informational hierarchy of emergence that it may have more to do with us being at the center of this hourglass. That we're at an information bottleneck and that when our tools improve, we find as much complexity in the microscopic or the macroscopic as we do at the meso level.Andy: Yeah. I think that's a very important insight. And we see that and in particularly with the workshop this week, once we realized that there's this whole community of organisms living in humans or other animal and plant species, the microbiome, we realized there's as much biodiversity inside us as there is outside that we're trying to save.Michael: On that note, it seems like a good place to start exploring your research and discussing it in this paper that you co-authored for Science Magazine’s Research Reports on a general consumer resource population model.Andy: Right.Michael: And this is a really clear example of the idea that really what we're looking for as David Krakauer said in the first episode of the show is compact, elegant, encodings to describe what we observe in nature, as simple as possible but no simpler than adequate. And so what you and your co-authors have done here is put together a really interesting general model for how organisms independent of their... we tend to think in terms of like heterotrophic predator-prey relationships, the Lotka-Volterra model. And you make, I think, a really smart argument here that that's a profound oversimplification. That it's not general enough. So could you explore this for me?Andy: The goal for doing that very much goes back to work on food webs. Similar things to Jennifer Dunne has been doing here. That is the central core of work we need to understand how places like Yellowstone work, how places like the Serengeti work. We need models for food webs. They will always have two components. The geometry of the web and how different species are coupled together to give some geometric pattern and that geometry will tell you something about stability, but you also need a generalized mathematical function that tells you about the scaffolding poles if you like, the couple the different species together.And so what we were trying to say is, sometimes those relationships, the predator-prey relationships, sometimes they're virus and host relationships, sometimes they're elk eating grass. Could we have a general form for those equations? Because people have tended to use, starting with the Lokta-Volterra equations, different variants on those. Now is there an underlying set of equations which could collapse them to give you any of the other types of equations, but you could use them for any type of interaction? And hopefully the thing that would determine the way they collapse down would be the relative body size of the predator or prey or more generally the consumer and the resource that they're consuming. So it's an attempt to find a general set of functions that could be used to couple together the geometry of food webs.Michael: One of things I really enjoyed about this was how it brings to light how these types of relationships may change over the lifespan of an organism. That you get partitioning between different life stages of a single creature or you get even at a single phase in an organism's life, it may have different types of consumer-resource relationships, like the leech, right. Is this example where it's a predator sometimes and it's a micro predator at other times, so how are you seeing or how are you imagining this shedding new light on the way that we understand these trophic networks and how we can start to use this additional dimensionality to explain some of the complexity that we see in ecology.Andy: We hope that that approach will help in several ways. One, it even relates particularly to the working group we're looking at this week, the age and immunity. Because one of the classic things with consumer-resource, predator-prey relationships is that a predator only eats you once. You spend a lot of your life being scared and worried about the lion that might be out there or a crocodile, but that's a one-off interaction. You may only lose a limb. But in contrast to that, you are steadily accumulating a bunch of parasites and pathogens. You may only have a transient relationship with an influenza virus for a week but it changes your immune system in a way that modifies how it will react to another attack by a tiny little predator type thing, like the next flu virus to come along.If you get a worm, which is a not too tragic a thing to happen, but you've got that as a companion for the next five to 10 years, and that also modifies the way that A your immune system operates, and B the amount of food that's available to you, you sharing it effectively in the worm through that period of time. And people living in Africa and South America have a whole community of pets living in their guts that they're sharing their food with. So it's looking at how do we understand… from a food web perspective, how much energy is going into the parasitic species, of which there may be a huge diversity versus along the traditional herbivores eating plants, carnivores eating herbivores, lines of the food web. So it gives you a mechanism of looking at the dynamics of those things and understanding how they affect energy flow.Michael: This seems like it also might illuminate how different lineages have shifted in their strategy over time. Like where a predator or a micropredator may become a parasite over same period.Andy: Right. Yeah. Well, that does seem to be… One of the things we were able to do in that paper. Was to say, because we can show these general equations class down in different ways, there's effectively a phylogeny in the way that different consumer resource relationships are related. And that very much splits with this bifurcation of being eaten from the outside-in versus from the inside-out. We also find that the evolution of parasitism seems to be very much tied in with the species that were originally living on decomposing bodies.Most of the species that have evolved to be some form of pathogen are things that have ancestors that were feeding on decomposers and decided just to move into the thing that became their host while it was still alive, and then feed on it while it's still alive. And we're talking in evolutionary time here rather than in the course of the lifespan of an organism. And in the end, having a sort of interaction, a co-evolutionary interaction with it. Let’s keep it alive a bit longer because it'll keep feeding us if it's alive. Whereas if it's dead, we'll have to go and find another one to feed on.Michael: Right. Kind of similarly, you brought up Jennifer Dunne and the way that she and her colleagues have started including “use webs” into their trophic networks. Not just, “We're feeding on this thing,” but, “We might be harvesting living animals for resources,” shearing sheep and that kind of thing. So, I mean it's not a long jump from this kind of general model to economic evaluations and looking at different kinds of economic relationships, corporate mergers, the way that different human agencies depend on one another, the way different human communities depend on one another. Have you and your colleagues worked much on that?Andy: No. It's something we're starting to work on. I've started working with economists in France. We were beginning to look at, can we make models for decisions that people living in poverty make and that are affected by the economic services they get from the biodiversity around them? Whereas at the same time, some of the decisions they make will reduce that biodiversity. So can we begin to develop economic theory for people living on the economic margins very much embedded in natural ecological systems of people like in the Amazon or in the Serengeti and also including early farming like around the Mediterranean. One of the most curious conversations I had there — and I noticed you had the figure up — that one of the figures that consistently emerges from that work that appeared on that generalized consumer resource models is you always have some saturating function relating the abundance of resource to the amount that gets consumed.And I was talking to the economists about this and they said, "Well, what's that function? We rarely ever use something like that.” This concept of things saturating was very alien to that man. And I was like, "What?" That is central to all ecological models of the way that species interact together. Yet it doesn't seem to be a common way that the economists think about it. So even bringing that approaching would help. And then one of the things we're trying to do is bring together models that have aspects of ecological models with aspects of economic models and aspects of models for diseases, which is basically, I just think of it as a special case of a predator-prey relationship. But the disease people tend to think of them as a more pure thing. Do we get through the insights from bringing together three different disciplines to see and that's a huge amount of emergent complexity. But how does it change the way each of those disciplines thinks about their problems?Michael: Yeah. So that paper that you're just mentioning here, this “General ecological models for human subsistence, health, and poverty” in Nature Ecology & Evolution. Yeah. This one was kind of discouraging in some respect. This studying poverty traps and really what the realistic limits of our global sustainable development strategies are. So I'd love to hear a little bit more about how you are applying this kind of thinking to where we can set our expectations for the eradication of poverty and also the risk or the threat of poverty and even more well-to-do nations. Because it really looks like we're all perched on the edge of a precipice all the time.Andy: It does. I mean those models very much say that there’s a likelihood of going in two different directions and how do we avoid going in the worst possible direction of having lots of people living in poverty? One of our agendas there was we are now entering the period of the sustainable development goals which have set guidelines for what we'd like the world to look like by 2030. There's about 17 of those and we’ve been working, could we start developing a framework initially in those papers, and now they say with an overlapping group of colleagues that were more economists this time, to say, "How can we realistically find ways of taking models for biodiversity and its loss, how that affects people's food and the other things that affect their survival and health and integrate those into a common framework?”And how many of the sustainable development goals are compatible with each other? And once you start putting them on these frameworks, how many of them are incompatible and how are we going to deal with this, because of the UN goal and people have signed up to this development goals is to have all of those goals met. And it may be that there are incompatibilities or interactions that take you down the wrong trajectory.Michael: So yeah, one of the things that comes out of the models in this paper is that, “Globally stable poverty,” you write, “represents the largest portion of the perimeter space for all models explored.” And especially for the more complex models, it seems like…Andy: It's a deeply worrying result, but in fact we have two groups of people working on different aspects of those problems in parallel. And it consistently came up as avoiding that poverty trap is a nontrivial problem.Michael: And that has to do with reinforcing positive feedback.Andy: Definitely. And finding ways to focus both on people's health and on their nutrition and the food that's available to them and the fact that lots of that is coming from other species that we need to keep those other species going for those both to reduce disease risk and to enhance food availability.Michael: So this is linked to Ross Hammond's work on the Global Syndemic, right? That this notion that climate change and malnutrition and obesity are reinforcing one another. And so this seems like it makes pretty clear policy prescriptions about where the best place to put investments are if you really want to lift people out of poverty.Andy: Well, to a scientist it makes clear recommendations. To a politician, it's intensely inflammatory because it may not fit in with their perceptions of what needs to be done or their perceptions of what their philosophy says needs to be done. Again, one of the largest problems we have with all of the work we do that deals with the environment and health is how do you present the science in a way that it isn't inflammatory from a political perspective.Michael: That seems like it requires its own kind of complex systems thinking in terms of getting people to think across multiple different timescales rather than just within an election cycle.Andy: Yes. According to Greta Thunberg, we've probably got two election cycles to go before it'll all be irrelevant.Michael: So in that sense, that is oddly optimistic because what that means is that the political goal time horizon and the ecological goal or economic goal time horizon are actually getting closer.Andy: Yeah. What we'd see with things like the fires in Australia at the current time and how that's massively undermining the Australian prime minister's position. That tragically, I think we're going to have to have more environmental disasters like that to turn the political minds to say, "Actually, we really need to start listening to what the scientists are saying." But similarly, there is so much science being done that there's a need for more cogently sharp messages for the people who are protesting on the streets to say, "The scientists specifically say this. We want that to happen. The scientists are saying that. We need that to happen." Rather than just listen to the scientists, the scientists have to put a sharper message out there for the people on the streets to send back to the politicians.Michael: So that seems like it links nicely into this other piece…you’re the lead author for this piece of PLOS Medicine on sacred cows and sympathetic squirrels. And making a really interesting case looking at how the epidemiology links to the way that different cultures regard different animals. Could you talk a little bit about that?Andy: That came from a meeting we had at Penn State because there's this controversy within the world of wildlife disease, infectious disease people, about “How important is biodiversity either as a source of new pathogens or as a buffer for old pathogens?” And so we were discussing the various mechanisms by which perhaps for things like Lyme disease in the Eastern US having possums around… Possums are fabulous magnets for ticks. So the possums get covered in ticks but don't get Lyme disease but every tick that attaches to a possum, usually which it then goes on to eat, stops a human being infected if that tick happens to be affected. So there's a benefit to biodiversity there. For other diseases, the more hosts, the more other species are out there, then there's a higher risk that they'll have a pathogen that might come across.So could we delineate the mathematical structure of host communities that says, under which circumstances will having more diversity of host species increase the risk of humans getting disease or their livestock getting disease and under which circumstances will more host diversity reduce the risk of human disease? And the bottom line is, for things that are transmitted usually by factors, which we tend to think of frequency dependent transmission, having higher biodiversity is usually a good thing. Because it gives plenty of suboptimal hosts for the vectors to go and feed on and that reduces the risk to humans. We tend to live in directly transmitted things. Things like Ebola or SARS or this new SARS like-thing that's here. As long as there's lots of species out there, there's probably lots of diseases we haven't discovered yet that may pop over from them. And so we should be slightly more worried about directly transmitted diseases in terms of new things emerging than we should from better transmitted diseases.Michael: So yeah. So just as an example,  you make this supposition, which you acknowledge as a controversial supposition, that that's where the tradition of the sacred cow comes from, right?Andy: Right. Now well, it comes from work done in India with Mercedes Pasqual who's on the board of trustees here. But we noticed going around some of these towns in the very impoverished parts of India. That there would be a huge difference between one house would have a cow in the backyard, another couple of houses wouldn't have a cow. Now the kids in the house with the cow, were much much healthier. That could be the fact that if you had a better job and had more money to feed your kids then your kids would be healthier and you could buy a cow as well.But it looked as if everybody was financially challenged. But the difference was if you had a cow, the cow is wonderfully attractive to mosquitoes. And so instead of the mosquitoes biting your kids and giving them malaria, they go and bite the cow and the cow doesn't get malaria. Plus you have the advantage of the cows giving you milk, which you can make into cheese. So the kids are better fed and less risk of getting malaria. And indeed when we talked to people they said, "Oh yeah, all those people with cows, their kids haven't got as sick as ours do.”Michael: It seems like a similar effect too, but through a different mechanism to the work on... like the children that play in the dirt, children that have dogs and cats in the home, there's a number of different ways in which a more biodiverse home environment can be beneficial.Andy: Oh, yeah. Well, I mean we certainly see it around the Serengeti in East Africa where I work. There's a huge population of dogs which we've been working on with my colleagues there to vaccinate them, prevent those dogs having rabies because the last thing you want is your kid to get rabies. But the dogs do a fantastic job of keeping the kids cleaned up, keeping the area around the house cleaned up and that massively reduces the risk to the children from other diseases. People are thrilled to have a dog because one of the ways of keeping your relationships good with your neighbor is getting a litter of puppies and passing the puppies out to share.So although you could have quite an effect on reducing the risk to rabies by sterilizing the dogs, that's the last thing that the local people want. Because if you sterilize the dog, it's useless to them, it's not going to have puppies anymore. So they want both the benefit which may be subconscious to them of the dogs cleaning up the area around the house and preventing quite a lot of diseases for their kids plus a constant production of puppies to use to keep yourself in with your neighbors and other friends in the village.Michael: Yeah. One of the things that comes up again and again in these papers of yours though, is that it's not clean cut simple linear relationships. You mentioned that cattle create new environments for mosquitoes to breed.Andy: So we were looking at both Gujarat and Delhi. But if you go across from Gujarat into the desert regions of Pakistan, their having cattle may increase the risk of malaria, because there are pools of poop and everything, a great breeding ground of mosquitoes. So all these relationships and nonlinear, right back to the generalized predator-prey model. At the heart of that is that nonlinear relationship which the wonderful book on the Serengeti Rules goes right back to Michaelis-Menten saturating functions of what cause nonlinearities in food webs and many other processes.Michael: I'm glad that you're bringing up the Serengeti stuff because I meant to ask you…You’re not really discussing explicitly in any of the papers that I've read of yours, but you do mention on your website that you do this work with the Serengeti Biocomplexity Project and I'd love to hear more about that.Andy: Well, as I said, initially my interest there was to go and work on different diseases. Particularly diseases that were shared between wildlife and domestic livestock. Initially focusing on rinderpest, which is one of the two diseases that have ever been eradicated by vaccination. And then all the early work on that was done around the Serengeti and then up in Nairobi by a wonderful guy called the Walter Plowright. That then led to work looking at vaccination of domestic dogs because they have rabies, which can be transmitted to children. And we're getting 50 to 60 children a year dying from rabies, which is a horrible way to die. So if you could vaccinate the dogs against rabies at the same time, you could vaccinate them against another disease, canine distemper, which was spilling over from the dogs into wildlife and causing outbreaks in lions, leopards, hyenas, and another disease called canine parvovirus, which was causing declines in the in the wild dogs.So looking at those disease control projects also got me thinking, like, when we get these disease outbreaks in wildlife, it completely changes the structure of the natural food web. And once the disease is eradicated, we get an opportunity to see how the whole ecosystem responds to the removal of one particular pathogen. So one of the amazing things about the Serengeti is that it was completely different 100 years ago than it is today, because this rinderpest hugely reduced the abundance or wildebeest, buffalo almost disappeared. That meant there was less food for the predators, the lions and the hyenas. Once it was eradicated in the early 1960s, we get this huge increase, almost a factor of 10, in the abundance of the herbivores and that leads to an increase in the abundance of the carnivores. So again, this wildlife management perception that predators are controlling prey is completely turned on its head by that.It says actually diseases are controlling the abundance of these things. Once you remove the diseases, you get an increase in the herbivores and that leads to an increase in the predators, so they couldn't possibly have been controlling the prey. It was the abundance of food for the predators that was controlling their abundance. And then that got sketchy thinking, well, how are all those things coupled together in the food web and to understand it, do we need to have every single piece of the food web or can we just look at the main branches, that grass that the wildebeest eat, the wildebeest, the zebra and the buffalo, the commonest species, and then the commonest species of carnivores. And how much of an understanding do we get just by looking at that core 10 species rather than the 10,000 other species that are there?Michael: It seems akin to some of the counterintuitive results that you discuss in this PLOS One piece you coauthored on social structure, demography and transmissions, the interactions between these things determining disease persistence in primates. Can you talk a little bit about how you put these models together and how they yielded surprising results?Andy: Yes. That was a project I was doing within an undergraduate at Princeton, Sadie Ryan, who's now a tenured faculty member at the University of Florida, Gainesville. We were interested in, what is the relationship between social systems and disease? I played around with some theoretical models for that and then decided it would be interesting if we could focus in on one group of species. And I should step back and say that interest in social systems and disease really started emerging when HIV appeared.Because up until then people hardly talked about sexually transmitted diseases. And there was very little information on social systems. We knew a little about the social system of like, the British Royal family, but we had no other data on, not particularly good data on human social interactions, because people were quite quiet about it. So we thought it'd be interesting to look across primates because of fantastic field studies of primates where individuals have been followed through time, and there's a variety of different social systems that are also very good databases on the different types of parasites and pathogens that go through different primates.So we wanted know, as social systems become more complex, does that allow more pathogens to establish in them? And what type of pathogens appear in different social systems? And of course one of the instant ironies that emerge is that the ultimate social system that many people would like us to live in is this sort of monogamous territorial system that will be characterized by some sort of top carnivore in a system. If you have a system like that, the only diseases you're going to get are sexually transmitted diseases, because the only time you have any interaction with another member of your species is when a male and female meet to mate. And that's the only opportunity for disease transmission. The rest of the time there's no contact, so there can't be any disease transmission. Now you will pick up things, if you're a carnivore, from your food, but you then translate that in some ways back to your food.It's only when you have these more complex social systems like the chimpanzees and gorillas and the baboons where you have promiscuous systems, but you've actually got the abundance of interactions that allows non-sexually transmitted diseases to establish. So we wanted to look across primate social systems and see how much of those patterns emerge. And it was quite a strong signature that as you go from the smaller primate species, which tend to be monogamous and territorial, they mainly only have STDs. Once you go up to the larger primate species that live in large groups, there's a much larger diversity of diseases.Michael: So this seems like you would find very distinct patterns in disease ecosystems between like the chimps and the bonobos, right?Andy: Well, the chimps and bonobos do seem to have fairly similar pathogens because the other thing with diseases, you have the diseases you come down through evolution with quite a lot of the time. And these chimps and the bonobos probably only split like four to five million years ago, maybe even later, more recently than that. So they have subtly different social systems, but they're still living in groups with lots of interactions between them. And body size is roughly the same thing and they're living in similar habitats. But the difference then between, say the chimps and the baboons that are out in the Savannah is much more dramatic, but the split between them is much deeper.Michael: So one of the things that you mentioned in this is that this has a lot to do with whether the organisms in question develop an immunity or not, right. So like exposure may actually be beneficial if you're developing an immunity?Andy: Yeah.Michael: And so I wonder, surely there have been thoughts to what this means in terms of how economic changes affect the kind of decisions that… Like, a lot of people in my generation now are doing co-housing, the way that the suburbs are populated is changing with like multiple families living in a single home and so on. What do you see as emergent concerns given the shifts in lifestyle and demographic and that kind of thing among human beings?Andy: Well, that raises a fascinating bunch of questions. If we look over, just human history and when different types of diseases have emerged. Most new diseases don't appear at random, they usually arise because the opportunities for transmission change as human social organization changes. So if you think of all the biblical plagues, those all arose when people started living in cities and they were bigger aggregations of people living together, providing enough people for chains of transmission not to be broken so as things like measles, whooping cough could establish in those situations. Changes in agricultural practices allow other diseases to come in and like the sacred cows begin to start creating taboos in societies that live in certain ways to prevent exposure to certain types of diseases. We don't know what people living in the suburbs is going to do to different types of diseases.It may be a mix, plainly, we have much stronger tools for dealing with disease now. But with good tools for dealing with many of the diseases and pathogens we're familiar with, if something new appears, we have to ramp up quite quickly to know how to deal with it. But we're also getting better at that. I mean the new SARS-like thing that's appeared in China. And then there was a case in Japan yesterday and I think a case in Thailand, it's killed two people. But there's a group of people who really understand those diseases on it to try and work out what do we do next? Is this a big threat or is it something we can deal with in a similar way that we dealt with SARS?Michael: Relatedly, there is this when Lauren Ancel Myers gave her community lecture here a while back, one of the things that it makes sense would be preoccupying epidemiologists now is the just explosion of Intercontinental air travel. But one of the things that comes out of the models that you're making for this paper are that there's a suggestion that there's a threshold of within group infection before the disease can disperse to another group. And so I think this reminds me of a few years ago, Spotify bought the musical big data company, Echo Nest, and one of the things that they were looking at is where the viral pop hits come from.Andy: Right.Michael: And it seemed like the incubators for innovative new music were island nations like the UK, like Iceland, Australia, places where... and this makes sense with island biogeography.Andy: It needs people talk with each other to take off, yeah.Michael: Right. These tightly connected local networks. And this is related to work that the military has done on engineering viral media. So the question to me is it seems like while we have reason to be concerned about the increased rate of international travel, that it may be that the flattening of the world in this way is actually inhibiting the local saturation and incubation required for certain forms of disease transmission.Andy: Well, again, those initial models on the primates were instructive. We were using a static framework there. We assume the social systems were relatively static and then compared what type of pathogens could be sustained by hosts with different social systems. More recently, with work in Yellowstone, we managed to develop a more dynamic framework that allows the abundance and the group size of the host to be dynamic and then what happens when you put pathogens into those? And there again you get this thing which is called a social trapping.Whereas depending on the relative rates of within group transmission and between group transmission, you can have pathogens that get into a social group, affect everybody in that group. But there's not enough between group contact for them to get out of it. So they die out quite quickly in the handful of groups that get infected. Other types of things are like the air travel. Everybody's coupled together and these things can spread quite quickly. In terms of emerging diseases, those would be the things I'd be worried about.Michael: So to zoom out a little bit from this point, you observe in this work that there is a a broader problem with the way that we're thinking about conservation biology, in terms of the fragmentation of populations and habitats and that we tend to look just at the gross numbers of remaining species rather than the way that the these smaller populations and a fragmented environment lead to this kind of nonlinear relationship.Andy: Well again, it’s a double edge sword. If you have populations that are divided into social groups or into habitat fragments, if those habitat fragments are well-connected, then a disease that gets in can move from habitat to habitat and social group to social group if it's something that species hasn't seen before, then they can cause you big problems. Although we are desperately worried about fragmenting up nature, if those fragments are not coupled together too strongly, then you can get a disease outbreak in one fragment and it will spread to the others.So you might lose all the individuals in that fragment, but you may then well, be able to repopulate it from some of the ones where the disease outbreak didn't occur. So again, it's a double-edged sword, and it's interesting from an evolutionary perspective of how the pathogens establish in the host species with different social systems. And then the practical thing is, how is it best to focus on the infected group or is it best just to reduce the rate at which the thing moves between groups.Michael: This seems like it may have some actionable insights with respect to the growing conversation over the last few years in terms of decentralizing our social architecture.Andy: Yeah.Michael: In one sense it seems kind of discouraging that this idea of a global internet for example, is starting to balkanize. But in other respects that seems like it may actually be useful to us in terms of allowing different island networks to devise different strategies for social organization.Andy: Well, again, it would be interesting. I know they have this wonderful experiment that the SFI Postdocs, when they locked in the house for [72] hours and they have to come up with a publishable paper but they'd came up with, “How would a beneficial pathogen spread?” I think it was one of the first time they did that. But it'd be interesting to take the model they did for that and then put it into one of these social system models and say actually, how do beneficial ideas spread from group to group? Because one of the artifacts we get with this wolf disease model is that the biggest risk for a wolf is another wolf. The wolf groups kill each other all the time. So 75% of the wolves in Yellowstone get killed by other wolves.But if you have a disease that reduces the abundance of wolves or reduces the number of wolf groups, then the size of wolf groups goes up because there's less groups to have negative interactions with each other. Now will that turn itself inside out if you had beneficial interactions with the group? Will the groups get bigger, and ultimately the group that was benefiting most kill all the other groups? So what's the upside and the downside of these beneficial and detrimental things that may be detrimental or beneficial to a group. What's their effect once the groups are coupled together? Again, that will give you hopes of insights into social networks and how information spreads through those.Michael: Yeah, there's so many places to look in the modern news that remind me of the 30 years war and just like, the insane religious mess that Europe was after the protestant reformation.Andy: Absolutely.Michael: So do you get that question regarding a particularly successful religious paradigm as a beneficial mutation, and how that ends up shifting the political landscape across the Western world over the last few hundred years.Andy: Well, McNeill, in Plagues and Peoples, makes this case that the original spread of Christianity through the Roman empire was massively held by measles. That there was measles spreading through the Roman empire at the same time. If you saw someone with measles and gave them a drink of water out of sympathy as the way a good Christian would, the survival rate of those people came up and they thanked God for all that help. But if they hadn't have had the measles to be killing them in the first place, Christianity may well have spread at a much slower rate. And so McNeill talks about that way back in the 60s in Plagues and Peoples.Michael: To loop back to, we were talking about biodiverse human communities with cows and dogs and so on. I'm reminded of a comment my friend David Titterington made once about the holy water. Like the holy water is the dirtiest thing in the whole church and everybody's putting their hands in it.Andy: Helps you rehydrate when you're really dehydrated. There's a cost benefit that it may lean towards the benefits.Michael: So you mentioned being here for the working group on aging and adaptation, all that. Now, what else are you working on at Princeton or?Andy: Well, as I said, I've been doing lots of work on these social groups and how that affects disease transmission. With a wonderful postdoc I had, we've been doing work on scaling. Very much inspired by the work that Geoffrey West, Brian Enquist, and Jim Brown did here. And then seeing, can we use that in models to look at how does the immune system scale? So as you have hosts of different size and the immune system we have in humans evolved from the immune system that was certainly there in the earliest mammals and simply before that, lizards and then right back to sea anenomes and sponges. So how did the different components of that, the T cells and the B cells, have much smaller variation in size than the hosts they're living in. The T cells and the B cells in an elephant, aren’t three orders of magnitude bigger than the ones in me or in a mouse. They're roughly the same size.One of the most important functions is keeping a memory of what diseases and what pathogens have you seen before. But if the life expectancy of those cells is a function of their size and their size doesn't change too much, how do they do this business of keeping memory in a finite population of cells that have a finite life expectancy? And so can we look at ways of trying to understand how the immune system kept up with the body size evolution of the mammals and the birds, and can we make simplified models of the immune system that we could use to compare how it functions in a mouse compared with how it functions in a cow or a human or sheep, right up to an elephant.With the interesting sideline, the birds have much lower mass than mammals because they have to fly. So their immune systems are very similar but subtly different. And then bats have to fly. So how do their immune systems work compared to mammals that don't fly? Because if you have hollow bones, where do you get the bone marrow to make the B cells that are a part of your immune system? And so do these species have immune systems that operate in subtly different ways and how many insights can we get to that from looking at this two levels of scaling, how does the component parts of the immune system scale with their physical size? And how does that operate in different ways in this pool of the host of different sizes?Michael: So this seems really intimately related to questions about human cultural memory and how human society has scaled and the amount of information that civilization is trying to track. At any given time we've had to come up with new outboard forms, that are written language, or even prior, David Krakauer’s work in the late 90s with Martin Nowak at Princeton on the evolution of syntax emerging as a response to the risk of an error catastrophe.Andy: Right.Michael: So what do you imagine we're going to see in terms of how an elephant immune system is operating with similarly sized components across this much larger context?Andy: Well, part of the things that we’ve been getting glimmers of over this week is that as the host body size gets larger, big parts of the immune system slow down. So they're essentially working at a rate similar to basal metabolic rate. So larger mammals have slower metabolic rates than smaller ones. So having the rate at which your immune cells replicate, slowing down, maybe giving you enough time to have your memory cells last as long as you do. That's the result, we haven't fully tied up yet. That will begin to get to that. We also have something we realized only comparatively recently in humans that some of the diseases, particularly things like rinderpest that we mentioned earlier in the Serengeti or the distemper in dogs or measles in humans, one of the things it does is it causes a disease in you, which itself is really nasty.But the other thing it does is it completely wipes out your immune memory. So it's like having to restart again at whatever age you have to get measles. And so, often prior to vaccination, people who got measles would get sick over the next two years from all the things they'd had before they had measles because they had to regenerate their immune system. So we're finding these things, that measles and rinderpest and distemper do similar things in other host species of eradicating your immune memory, which means you've got to get sick to everything again to build that memory up again.And that's a bit like going in and tearing up the library to get rid of all those books and then having to collect them again because that's what that virus has done to you. Which is, I can't think of stronger reason to vaccinate your kids against measles because they're going to get really sick from a whole bunch of other things again. So the older you get those things, pathologically, it's worse to have measles as you get older, but similarly it's eradicating much more memory because you've been around more longer to accumulate that memory.Michael: So the first part of that, talking about lowering the base metabolic rate of the immune system. I was interviewing Melanie Moses, the same…Andy: Oh yes, fabulous person.Michael: Yeah, the same seats and she was talking about this with respect to anthills and how like, as the ant hill gets larger and larger, fewer and fewer of the ants are active at any given time. And we're saying, this looks like, when I was talking, again, with W. Brian Arthur and he was talking about this in terms as production gets, as just our economy scales. Then we put less emphasis on production. Production gets easier with scale and more emphasis on the distribution of resources and how this starts to suggest a universal basic income, the question of maybe at 10 billion people, most people are just watching TV at any given time.Michael: But then the question in the second part of what you're talking about here, which is that to try and draw an analogy to human civilization from the immune system. That there are ways that we might view the accelerating pace of our technological surround as a measles equivalent type of thing to the extent that the more that we're focused on the Twitter time horizon, the quarterly financial reports, the more imperiled we are by threats that we, at earlier moments in history, have already faced.Andy: Right.Michael: Yeah. So I don't know, that's just sort of broad. Well, I think there's multiple analogies to make here. I think one of the things that causes these social networking programs to collapse, if you think of the earlier ones is, the thing that finances them is the advertising. So when you first join in, you've got a handful of friends and you have good interactions with those. As it gets bigger and bigger, it becomes a bit like the dilution effect in these disease things. You're getting more and more advertising, that means it's very hard to find the messages from your friends. And it's got this thing for maybe they'll only send you a message if you talked with that friend in the last couple of weeks, but you're still busy filtering your way through the advertising and all the other fire hose of nonsenses in there.Andy: Then eventually that particular social network's useless because of the dilution effect of everybody else's information means you can't find what you're looking for in it. And so a new one will arise. So I think now every four or five years the kids in the schools get a new one and then their parents slowly adopt it to see what their kids are doing and then the advertisers pick up on that and it's something nobody wants to use it anymore because there's dilution effect of too much information that's useless to you. That you're spending too much of your time filtering your way through. Kills that whole network. And so I do see in this dilution effect and disease. The real signal you're looking for gets lost in this massive noise.Michael: And yet this is probably something we're not going to design our way out of, right?Andy: No. Because it's what pays for it.Michael: Like there's the whole issue of increasing returns and preferential attachment, right?Andy: Right.Michael: So I remember, I think it was, review the future of podcasts, that had Kevin Kelly on. And they were asking him about, the internet seems to reward monopoly. It seems to create these enormous monopolies faster and faster. And they were like, "Well, are you worried about this?" And he was like, "Well, no. Not really. Because it overturns the monopolies faster than it used to." So I don't knowAndy: Yeah. This is interesting. It is amazing how quickly it's developed, but also how rapidly some of the things that were dominating early on have disappeared. Some before they even had time to become monopolies. But it's also massively overturned many of the older monopolies as well. The high streets are a completely different place now than they were even five, 10 years ago.Michael: So given that almost everything that we've touched on in this conversation is a double edge sword. What provides up your optimism? Where do you feel good about the direction that this planet is heading right now?Andy: Well, there's two parts onto that. To me as a scientist, these places like Santa Fe Institute, coming here, spending time, talking with intelligent people, working on hard problems will always be stimulating. And the rest of the world disappears I think when I'm here, which is part of your problem, but fabulous for me. And then the thing that's given me huge optimism is actually Greta Thunberg and all these children, young people out on the street saying, "We have to do something about this. Stop messing around with them."The political discussion that's going on at the moment is so distant from reality and the problems we have to face in the next decade, that actually, for the first time in 25 years, I feel optimistic because these people saying, "Listen to the scientists." And that's why I think the scientists need to sharpen their message for people to say, "This is what we need to have on." And having people, not in the political arena, but outside the political arena, demanding the politicians to see that these are the problems we have to deal with rather than the message they're getting themselves into.Michael: So basically, like we mentioned earlier, in a weird way, the urgency is its own...Andy: The urgency is now being felt and hopefully we have enough time to solve the scientific or find solutions to those scientific and health problems in the very little time we have available.Michael: Wonderful. Well, Andy, thank you so much. Yeah. This has been a real…Andy: We've covered quite a lot of ground.Michael: ...a real barnstormer. Yeah. Awesome. Thanks a lot.Andy: They’ll have confirmed that I have gone mad.  [Laughs.]
16,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Well, Chris Kempes, it's a pleasure to have you actually back on Complexity Podcast.Chris: Yeah, thanks. Good to be here.Michael: Yeah, you were on episode two, which we recorded at #IPFest on Origins of Life, but it's nice to give your own episode and to go and do your research with a lot more granularity. Before we dig into your papers, I think the place to start is to talk a little bit about how you got into your work, how you became a scientist or ... And whatever way you understand that. And then how you ended up at SFI?Chris: Yeah, that's a great question. I mean many people point to childhood as a place where they develop certain types of interests and that's definitely true for me. As a kid I was fascinated by both astronomy and paleontology. I had this dual interest in the stars and in fossils and both are pretty strong. I don't know, there's always this sense in society that people are picking something to do or they have like one very specific thing that they want to do someday. When people would ask me, what's the thing you wanted to do? I had this conflict of like, "Well, how do I take these two things I really love?" Then eventually I'd say, "I want to be an astronomer and a paleontologist." Most people really laughed at that. Amazingly enough, that's what I've done over my scientific career is to combine biology and thinking about the history of life with questions of physics and astrobiology.If you take paleontology plus astronomy, I think you get life in space and the history of life and how physics guides all of that. I think those early interests very much have stayed with me over the years.Michael: And so now you're here and you're working with an excellent team on scaling laws and so on. Yeah. What drew you to SFI, or like, how did SFI select you?Chris: Yeah, that's another interesting question. In undergrad as I was still wrestling with this physics or biology question, I had done a lot of research in ecology while also majoring in physics. I was looking for places where those two combined and an early mentor pointed me towards a bunch of papers in scaling theory and how physics was influencing biology. I was hooked. I actually came to Santa Fe Institute as an undergrad researcher a couple of times during my undergrad career. I spent a summer here. I did a month long independent study as part of my curriculum at a different time. Then that really started to inform the types of research I did thereafter. My PhD was in physical biology which is a program that we created at MIT focusing on how you could start to bring physics into different biological processes beyond simple things like protein folding but really trying to get it at the macroscopic laws of biology.Things like scaling laws combining that with evolutionary theory and then the rest is history after that. Yeah.Michael: Excellent. Well, okay so it seems like the place to start today is with a 2012 PNAS paper that you lead authored on “Growth, Metabolic Partitioning, and the Size of Microorganisms.” You did this with Stephanie Dutkiewicz. Am I saying that right? And Michael Follows and this is a piece comparing the way that various energetic processes in a cell are allocated to growth and maintenance and how that differs between prokaryotic organisms and you eukaryotic organisms. I'd like to have you start with a little bit about the background in the thinking that motivated this research, why you decided to go here and then why this is a particular area of surprising and counterintuitive results. Then we can kind of dive into the details of this particular study.Chris: Yeah, that sounds great. Some of the classic work done in scaling theory is really trying to understand how architecture relates to various types of functions. Primarily how it relates to metabolic functions and then how you can drive a bunch of other features from those metabolic functions. There's this strong architectural connection there. Then if you think about it, you could say, "Well, as you go down the scale of size in life you start to cross all these different architectural boundaries." So as you go to unicellular eukaryotes, obviously you're transitioning from a multicellular organism that may or may not have a vascular system to unicellular organism. Which definitely isn't part of a larger network of cells and the avascular system is living as a free living cell and an environment, but still has some internal structure to it, the mitochondria, the nucleus, various other internal membranes.Then as you go smaller you crossover into bacteria which lose a lot of the internal structure that you see in the unicellular eukaryotes. Now I've told that story is the size-based way backwards but that's actually the opposite of the evolutionary direction, which went from these simple bacterial cells to increasing complexity and architecture. Anyways, so we see these shifts in architecture. We know that architecture is fundamentally related to metabolic processes and deriving scaling laws. Then we should expect to start seeing shifts in these relationships as you make these major transitions over architecture. There is some empirical work. Just before we did this paper showing that to be the case and putting forward a few hypotheses about what's shifting in the architecture.Then we said, "Well, what happens if we take that and start to build detailed energetic theories of single cell organisms in the same way that's been done for multicellular organisms, to start trying to understand physiology and growth in connection to these shifts in scaling relationships driven by shifts in architecture?”Michael: Starting with the per-unit cost thing about biosynthesis and maintenance being conserved in linear across all these different groups, right? What is the one thing go into a little bit of detail about this piece but the one thing that all of these different organisms have in common and then how you were able to use that to start to investigate the differences and the basis for those differences? That seems like a great place to start.Chris: Yeah, I mean I think one of the really amazing things that we saw was how much energy it takes to maintain or repair an existing unit of material in an organism. It appears to be roughly constant across all of life. I mean there's a huge amount of variation in that but there aren't systematic trends with size, for example. This says that to keep a unit of bacterial mass alive in terms of repairing it and maintaining its existence is roughly the same as keeping a unit of mass in a mammal alive. We thought that was really interesting that there isn't an architectural shift there. Then a lot of the biosynthetic terms, so how much energy it takes to manufacture a new unit of mass also appear to be roughly constant across all these different classes of organisms.Again, that's a slight simplification of some significant variation that's there. We take these two things together then once you have these differences in how metabolic rate changes with size. Those constants and this changing metabolic rate with size lead to these really different behaviors in the growth rates. Because that overall metabolism has to be broken down or partitioned into the energy you need to repair and keep existing biomass alive and the energy you can use then to synthesize new biomass. And so as you get bigger you get more metabolic power per unit mass. Then you can grow faster and faster as you get larger, and that's what you see in bacteria. If as you get bigger you have less metabolism per unit mass like in mammals then eventually your growth rate has to slow down and you stop growing in size.Contrasting bacteria to mammals, bacteria have this ever-increasing accelerating growth rate over their lifespan. Mammals have this decelerating growth rate that eventually leads to a fixed adult size like most humans have for example.Michael: This is butting up against the episode that we did with Melanie Moses on scaling. In the question of why is it that you see this upper bound on the size of bacteria? Like there's a point at which the metabolic rate required to grow that thing just becomes unsustainable, right? That's the transitions that like Lynn Margulis and other people are talking about in endosymbiotic transition. How does the architecture of a nucleated complex cell enable this and why does that lead to an inversion of this power law in the way that like metabolism and maintenance are allocated in a cell?Chris: Yeah, great question. We had exactly that same puzzle after finishing this first paper that we were just talking about. As bacteria get bigger, they have more and more metabolic power per unit mass. They have faster and faster growth rates. All of that's what you want. If you can grow faster than other organisms you can out-compete them. These all seem like good things to have. Our question was, well, why don't the bacteria continue to get bigger forever, right? Their architecture seems to favor this ever accelerating growth rate that in certain environments is really advantageous. You can out-compete slower growing things if there's enough resources around. We hypothesized in this paper that it must be something about some piece of the physiology not being able to keep up with those increasing metabolic rates.So it's actually not a metabolic problem that the largest bacteria run into it. It's likely some physiological problem where some basic biochemical rate or process simply can't keep up with the energy-harvesting capacity of these organisms. And so in a follow-up paper, looking at the composition of bacteria in terms of the main physiological features they have … So,  how much protein do they have? How many ribosomes do they have, or these machines that basically translate the stored information about what a cell is in the genome to the actual functional proteins of the cell, how many of those do they have? And we were able to write down some simple theories that show that as this growth rate increases eventually you get to a point where to keep up with that rate, you would need to put more stuff in the cell then the cell has space for.Basically the largest bacteria run out of physical space to pack in all the things they would need to keep up with this ever-increasing rate. I mean it's like if you had this huge power source, how many components would you need to use that power efficiently? Eventually that exceeds the space at which those can be packed into. That's what we think happens to bacteria is that they grow too quickly. They run out of the fundamental space for all the components they need to keep up with that fast growth rate and then there's something about the eukaryotic architecture that helps fix that. That's an unsolved problem in my opinion that has not been fully worked out, so how it is that eukaryotes then start having a slower metabolic rate with increasing size and why that then drives them to grow more slowly?I think there's a fundamental question about why that's true and it may all be tuned to the speed limit. We think that there might be a universal speed limit in the growth rate and forced by these internal space constraints that are reached by the bacteria and then saturate for the unicellular eukaryotes and then start to do really weird things in the multicellulars which is a whole other story that that gets even harder.Michael: Right, right. I'm realizing now that I totally jumped ahead into the next paper with that question, but before we go there and dig into that a little bit more. There are a couple of interesting points in this paper that I felt were worth unpacking a bit. One of them is about the reproductive strategies in eukaryotes and specifically you look at the budding yeast C. albicans, which rather than just standard fission is doing this budding thing and its growth rates are then reallocated at different points between the growth of the mother cell and the budding cells. You make an interesting point in here that the growth of the buds can be predicted by assuming that the bud is using all of the growth energy of the entire complex and the buds grow more rapidly because of the assistance of the entire complex rather than if these are growing in isolation.This is again a spot where you're starting to get into questions of the incentives for multicellularity. It just reminded me of as a personal link to this "It takes a village to raise a child" saying. And like we were talking about around the kitchen this morning about this issue of the economics of parenting — and this is a huge leap, but I'm curious how you feel this fits into the biophysics about as our nuclear family becomes a more dominant form and individual family groups are more self-reliant and more spread out. It seems as though that may be somewhat to do with the decline in child birth rates like industrial western countries like the United States over the last few decades. The increased self-reliance assumed or required by the family and how that seems to be inversely related to the productivity of a given family.Chris: I think there's an interesting analogy to draw there. Economists, several times different economists have told me that in developed nations understand decreased birth rates and how much longer people are waiting to have children in terms of integrating when you think you have enough resources to provide a child with the same level of lifestyle that you have. As the world gets more complicated that number may be harder to achieve. Now I haven't looked at any of those papers. I haven't seen what those calculations are but that at least seems to be the word on the street from certain economists that that may be what's going on.What's interesting here is that thinking about the whole process of giving birth to young from mammals all the way up to then communities raising children, I think what's happening with these yeasts that's really interesting is it's almost a primitive gestation. What's cool about that is that when you have this big complex then devoting most of its metabolic energy to grow in a small thing. It can make that thing look like it is growing like it's a much bigger thing growing in terms of its growth rate because there's all of this energy being distributed from many cells into one small cell. If you fit just that small cell without considering the whole complex, you'd say, "This thing has unbelievable energetic efficiency or it's somehow managing to get a huge amount of metabolic rate per that little mass." Really what it is, is an optimization of the complex, choosing not to grow the larger cells but been said meet that metabolic energy to growing small cells at a really high rate.And so this gestational strategy can help you produce lots of little offspring quickly. I mean, so it's an interesting community way to do that. Now where that starts to maybe potentially relate to groups of things collectively raising offspring, I think would be mostly about where are the efficiencies of energy harvesting amongst a group. Then deployed to a set of collective children or how much risk are you incurring when it's a larger group sharing resources composed to a very small group, those would have very different risk dynamics. You can imagine in certain, say,  hunter gatherer societies that these risks would be very different. Whether it's a small group, one nuclear family or a larger group collectively sharing things and that certainly would relate to offspring and how many individuals are in effect responsible for a particular offspring.Michael: There are plenty of other questions that come out of this particular piece, but I think that they relate just as well to the next article that you already touched on which is “Evolutionary tradeoffs and cellular composition across diverse bacteria.” This is just looking within bacteria. This is a 2016 paper you did with Wang, Amend, Doyle and Hoehler. This piece like you said this is about the way that different pieces of bacterial architecture scale as the whole thing gets bigger. I think it's worth actually starting at the end with this puzzle that you're left with, which is that even though like you said a moment ago, the growth rate scales superlinearly with the size of the bacterium, all of these components are scaling sublinearly. All of these components are scaling slower. And so something funny is going on here that leads to this emergent thing happening here.I'm curious, this is maybe like leading the horse with the cart, but what is this, why is this happening? It's not really a question you answer in this paper, but I mean, you've had plenty of time to think about it.Chris: Well and the answer is we still don't know. There's some follow-up work that we're doing now. We're trying to do certain types of global optimizations of the physiology to understand how all of these different components are related to each other.One thing we can say really nicely from this paper is if you take ... So, the ribosome which again is this little machine that basically takes these little tapes, little transcripts from the DNA and turns those into functional proteins. Its job is to read these tapes and produce proteins. Some of those proteins make itself up, so it’s also self-replicating itself. If you say, "We know how fast a cell is growing and we know how many proteins it has to replicate in order to divide,” then we have a really nice theory for how many ribosomes the cell needs. We take our theory for growth rate and we combine it with observations of how the number of proteins changes across cell size and then we can predict how many of these little ribosomal machines you actually need in a cell.That then does a very good job of predicting observed data. It says that for most cell sizes, most of the range of cell size is you have this sublinear scaling and the number of ribosomes. As the cell’s getting bigger, the ribosomes are diluting out — until you start to get towards really large cell sizes where the growth rates continue to go up. And then you get this rapid curvature and eventually this asymptotic behavior where the number of ribosomes that you would need to put in the cell goes off to or towards infinity. What you start to run up against there is the cell division time starts to look like the time it takes for a ribosome to replicate itself. You have these little machines that are doing replication inside the cell. The cell doesn't notice that replication timescale until it's trying to divide or replicate in the same time that one of these little machines are, and then it starts to run into all of these problems.That is this speed limit, is this ribosome replication rate, when the cell rate start to approach that, that's one of several ultimate speed limits on life. We understand that why that eventually becomes all of cell volume just these ribosomes. How all the other parts of the physiology are changing? Lots of interesting scaling relationships, they're all with really different exponents, all with hard to interpret exponent at first glance. We are building a more detailed theory to try and get at those but fundamentally we don't know yet.Michael: You just explained in detail what you call in the paper, the ribosome catastrophe. This is larger class of the error catastrophe. I learned about in college and actually is what got me into complexity thinking in the first place was this paper co-authored by Martin Nowak and now-SFI President David Krakauer on the evolution of syntax and language. There's a really interesting generalization that I think can be made from this math that gets into ... I want to see if you feel like I'm making the analogy correctly: that the DNA of a given bacterium is like the memory of an individual person and then the ribosomal volume is like the amount of words required to communicate that are like evolutionarily relevant in a given language.I mean, again, that's a little messy because it's not exactly intercellular signaling but there is the sense, which as Nowak and Krakauer mentioned in their work, that you reach a point where the burden on memory to remember every word you need to in order to get along in the world is just  unfeasible. You start getting copying errors and you fail to communicate. That seems to be the point at which you start getting syntax and language the way that you're getting the complexity of the eukaryotic cell that there's a new syntactic architecture emerges to cope with the informational requirements of this. I mean that's again, that's a little rough, but…Chris: No, I think there's some really interesting interconnections there. On this end of the ribosome using this language analogy, I think what you would say is that there's a storage system of the words that you could speak and then spoken words have utility and then there's this process in between that allows you to go from the words that you could speak to actually be actually vocalizing those words. Right. There's some computational effort there that's required. You have to in this case transcribe and translate the copied word to the spoken word, and there's a little device, this ribosome, that does that. If you think about the organism's pressure is all at speaking words, right. Having the spoken words out in the world where they actually have utility. Then yeah, one of the constraints for cells is how fast this internal machine can actually speak, right?How fast it can transcribe and then translate as a system. And eventually the rate at which you would need utility from words exceeds that speaking capacity. I think that is another limit. Yeah, I mean I think in this space there are lots of really interesting biological limits. The error catastrophe certainly is one, this ribosomal catastrophe is one. And I think as part of a larger research program it's really useful to go through lots of different ways of looking at life and think about where these ultimate limits are, and then think about how to start to abstract them so that we can get beyond the particular evolutionary history that we've seen on this planet and think about biological function in general from either an alternate origins of life perspective or an astrobiological perspective.That's actually something that David Krakauer and I've been thinking about and writing about a lot recently. I think, yeah there's really interesting intersections between these different types of limits and between these different types of abstracted processes in biology.Michael: Yeah, to verge on the astrobiological question, one of the things that you mentioned earlier is that there is this cup shape and the fraction of the drive volume of the cell that's taken up by ribosomal material. You end up with, what is in the middle zone, what is taking up the volume of the cell, if not drive volume? You talk like in a lot of cases its water, right? So as a right-brained artist type, I was like, "Oh that's funny because the graph looks as though it's like holding, like a vessel for this thing."Chris: If only we thought to say that in the paper!Michael: You start to speculate here on the evolutionary benefits of less of the cell being taken up by stuff and more of it being available for fluids. I'm curious to hear about this and then how this links to why you're going to find cells of different sizes occupying different niches and in different environments — and then how that might yield some predictions about where you're going to find very small cells, where you're going to find very large cells, and so on.Chris: Yeah. I think that's fascinating. One of the things we've been thinking very hard about is, is this water a requirement, right? Part of what having increasing amount of water to all these different molecules does for you is change the effective diffusivity these. How fast something can diffuse in the cell depends a lot on what the concentration of things in water are because that will adjust how likely you are to bump into another molecule or have a short-timescale weak bonding event with another molecule. We think actually we might be able to predict how much water you need thinking about these diffusive constraints.That's part of this upcoming work that we've been going through is getting at that. Now to your question about different niches and where these different organisms might live. We in this paper were slightly wrong about a pretty strong prediction we made, which was saying, "Okay, what will all the smallest cells look like?" Another way, thinking about that as, "What does a cell have to do to get very small," right? Well, it needs to have less proteins expressed inside the cell. It needs to have a smaller genome, all of these sorts of things. How do you start to reduce a genome? How do you start to get rid of genes and the need for certain expressed proteins? Well a lot of genes are kept around for dealing with lots of different types of environments, having lots of different metabolic options available to you and so forth.And so we looked at a lot of the smallest cells at the time, and saw that most of these are mammalian parasites. What does being a parasite inside of mammal do for you? Well, you have incredibly constant temperature. You have incredibly constant pH relative to other environments. You have this soup of amino acids around that you can use. These organisms in some cases don't even need to synthesize their own amino acids, right? They can just suck them up from the environment. You get these incredibly small slow-growing mammalian parasites that have tiny genomes and almost no stuff inside because they can rely on this incredibly rich and stable environment from a host. Cool, so I at the time would have said, "I expect all of the smallest cells in the future to be parasitic organisms that you see."A few years later, Jill Banfield's group discovered the new world record holding smallest bacteria, or set of bacteria. They're all groundwater microbes. They discovered them in this groundwater system. Not in another organism, not parasitic, not stable. What's interesting is that a lot of the work ... While those bacteria agree with us in terms of how big they are, they didn't agree in terms of the types of environments where we expected to find them. What's interesting is that a lot of her recent work out of the Banfield group is showing that it may be the case that many of those smallest bacteria are living in close association with larger bacteria. They may either be syntrophic meaning that there's some mutualistic co-metabolism where the small ones and the big ones are helping each other in some way, or they could be parasitic. We don't know.That's an interesting thing to follow up is what have they done to get such small genomes. At an abstract level it's consistent with this idea of a parasite in terms of, if you want to get a small genome you have to start living in a more complicated community. That community could be you as a completely negative parasite on some host or it could be you as either a beneficial or negative symbiotic living with some other community of bacteria so a lot more really interesting things to follow up there.Michael: To abstract that even further. I think a lot about the modern human brain case is smaller than that Neanderthal brain case or I've heard also like even the Cro Magnon brain case. That seems to be related to the issue of outboard memory again and the way that we are externally storing the necessary information required for human groups selection and collective computation. That there was like a transitional point where the emphases like left the individual and moved to groups of people.Now we're at this point where I remember David Krakauer gave an ACtioN Network talk in New York a while back, at UBS talking about technology and the vestigial human brain and comparing our evolutionary future to, like, tunicates, which at some point like loose, they decephalize. It's no longer required because they're just filter feeding which ties into this related thing that I've been thinking about which is how group life in some cases, yields a clam, where you're just positioning yourself in a flow of nutrients. And in other cases yields schools of fish, yields a smarter collective. To bring this back into economics a little more, this gets into questions about the emergence of the city and the emergence of the nation state, and how these kinds of concerns that you're addressing in this paper start to get into, like with the ribosomes, there are functional limits to the length of a sustainable supply chain, and like a minimum size for a nation and a maximum size for a nation. So here we are in 2020 and it's starting to look like a certain first-level analysis of global economic activity is woefully inadequate, and that certain economic processes are better at a global scale and others are worse.I'm curious, if you're willing to go out on a limb here, do you think … I know in his novel Bluebeard, Kurt Vonnegut said, "Any country larger than Denmark as a damned fools mistake." So I wonder if you think any kind of meaningful analogies can be drawn here that suggest that point us in a direction that yields fruitful shifts in economic policy. Or maybe, to take on a humbler goal, gives us concrete realistic predictions for what it's going to mean to be a human being in the years to come. I don't know, there’s absurd breadth there, but yeah.Chris: Yeah, I mean I would say yeah there's that interconnects with a lot of classic ideas and evolution and ecology. I'd say one of the simplest evolutionary ideas that we might think about from say bacterial ecology would be ... Okay so if I maintain a huge genome with lots of different metabolic possibilities and all different genes for responding to particular environments and so forth, that's great right? I as a single species have this capacity to be resilient and respond to a huge range of stresses from the environment. But I also have the cost of maintaining all of those genes, right? Every gene comes with some amount of overhead. If I want to replicate that gene into the next generation, I spend energy on replicating it. If I want to make sure that that gene isn't getting damaged, I spend energy repairing it.If it accidentally gets turned into a protein that I don't want, I have to respond to that and get rid of that protein, right? There's all of these different challenges to having larger genomes. There's some really nice recent work on thinking about the cost of maintaining genes amongst a small community of people. We've talked about it a little bit. Michael Lynch at ASU has talked about it. Nick Lane and Bill Martin have talked about it some. I think there is this really nice growing field of ways of thinking about those costs and how they relate to evolutionary dynamics. That's one end of the spectrum. But I have to be able to maintain the cost of this huge genome and any time that that cost is greater than the benefit I get out of it, there's an evolutionary pressure for me to get rid of these genes.Great. Other end of the spectrum is I have a tiny genome and I rely on ecology to help me do all the things I need to do or survive. Right. That's great because now each individual organism has this amazing efficiency because they have small genomes. They're just doing what they need to do. They rely on other organisms for different types of exchanges. Great. That may be more efficient, but it's also a fairly susceptible to perturbations, right. For that to work, I need to be able to rely on seeing those same partners of organisms in the future, right? One easy way to do that is to create such close associations that every time we divide in our transporter, we go somewhere else together as like a clonal organism and we've worked some on that, but you need to guarantee that you're going to see the same partners in the future.You sacrifice resiliency for efficiency and then the problem becomes likelihood of interaction and exchange in the future. Now how those ideas get scaled up to the global economy, and certain questions about size and efficiency, what happens in groups of people in cities? I think there's a huge richness in that biological thinking that can be translated into those spaces. It's not something I already know a huge amount about.Michael: It seems like one concrete example would be the way that you have entire cities in China devoted to manufacturing a particular good then how dependent those cities are on a thriving global economy. It's related to that issue of, when I was in a school for paleontology, the takeaway about how to survive a mass extinction was you don't specialize. That if you want to survive that you become a generalist. That's where you get into the survivalist thinking of people that move out of food deserts and start growing their own food and learning these strategies, and so on. Again, like you just said that that doesn't seem as like the amount of time it takes to learn those life skills is just absurd if you're going to participate in the modern economy.And so this work all points to a generalized balance between at what scale are you going to operate … Like obviously a Mennonite community is more resilient to global economic shutdown, but less capable of producing something that is of value to that economy, and then less capable of individually specializing, in the sense of like Maslow self-actualization. I mean I’ve got to be careful here but it does seem like that we are empowered to pursue hyper-specialization by the same biophysical constraints that make this planet more and more susceptible to perturbations. Like we talked about that with Matt Jackson in terms of hyper-connected bank networks and like cascading failures and so on.Chris: Yeah. I think a lot of this touches on these really classic economic ideas of specialization and efficiency. I think it's interesting that even in just the evolution of particular genomes and bacteria, you see the same thing.Michael: This seems like a great point – we're already here basically – in the last paper I want to touch on with you, which is the paper you wrote with M.A.R. Koehl and Geoffrey West on ... This is in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution on “The scales that limit: the physical boundaries of evolution.” This is really cool because this is where we zoom out from microbial life and unicellular stuff to trying to articulate a more general theory of evolution, and to bring the biophysical constraints into the picture. Like I asked you the first one, I think it's important to understand how the approach that you authors are working towards in this paper differs from the legacy thinking about evolutionary dynamics that we've inherited up to this point. Why is it important to bring these new considerations into the picture here?Chris: Yeah. I think a lot of classic thinking in evolutionary history especially thinking about comparative life history and so forth has very much seen the amazing complexity of individual species as the product of very detailed evolutionary histories, with a lot of contingency and path dependency and happenstance. All of which is true. That leads to a very specialized species living in a particular niche that can only really be understood in terms of this complicated history. And that’s all valid. A lot of that has been documented, how much of that is just random processes, how much you get locked into things, how much contingency is there? What we wanted to try and say is well all of that is happening in a physical world. That physical world has known constraints and those constraints could either be really close to a physical law, something like diffusion or they could be physical laws that have downstream effects in terms of forming some particular environment.What we wanted to say is really how much of evolution can be explained by thinking about those physical constraints first. When do those physical constraints matter more than all these other processes? And how do we just start to think about all of that? So we wrote down a framework really for interpreting when evolution should see a physical constraint, when these other processes are more important and how you're looking at the right physical constraint for understanding a particular organism. Scaling laws are a great example. Why do you see a scaling law across all organisms have vastly different size?A lot of the work coming out of the scaling world is really saying, and what we really try and argue in this paper is, that you see those scaling laws when there's a dominant physical constraint that applies to organisms of vastly different size. And that constraint matters enough compared to other processes that it shows up in evolution. Or that constraint is independent enough of all the other processes that it shows up in evolution. Some of the simplest early thinking about predicting scaling laws is saying, "Well if you imagine a spherical cell and if that spherical cell is just passively living in a bit of fluid, then it's going to have some resource supply rate that is just diffusing to it." From the laws of diffusion you can derive the limitations of resource supply to that cell and get a maximum metabolic rate. That gives rise to a really nice scaling law.Now that's all fine unless some of those features have many constraints they interact with, or if there's some internal contingent limitation based on other parts of the physiology. So for example, you might want to optimize some part of a mammal to dealing with say mechanical stress given its size and the gravitation of a planet. But you can't quite achieve the optimal because there's some historical part of the physiology that you would need to change to do that and it's just too hard to change that, or every small step, it was taken that change space comes with such a big cost that you can't escape this thing and so you can't actually optimize some part of the physiology. Then that's just a really then easy way to ask whether you think something's going to be completely driven by physical constraints or whether the optimization that evolution is doing through this random search process is best understood from the existing set of things you have and how they interact.We argue it's mostly comes down to how big an effect does the physical constraint have. So if you change a trait a little bit under some physical law, how much does that change your growth rate? If that's big enough, evolution will see it and you'll be able to start optimizing that physical constraint. And how independent is that optimization from all of the other traits of an organism. We argue since you see lots of scaling laws that can be interpreted in terms of a few physical constraints. It seems like lots of evolution has parts of physiology, parts of the organism's traits that are independent enough, or that the physical constraint is dominant enough, that it shows up in evolution. We think that's really exciting.Michael: It seems like for those who want to anchor this in the existing argument, it seems like this is a way of resolving the classic Stephen Jay Gould, Simon Conway Morris argument. Like you were saying, it's contingency versus convergence, and path dependency matters given the degree to which the constraints are actually in operation on an organism. You end up with a way to rigorously and quantitatively answer questions like, why is it that the golden age of mammals around 50 million years ago looks so very much like the golden age of dinosaurs, with all of these similar niches occupied and comparable temperature and oxygen levels in the atmosphere and so on? The substantial differences are due again to that contingent evolutionary history that each of these groups has to proceed from, right?You give some really cool examples in this paper. One of them is on the biomechanical constraints of an insect leg and the size of insects, and why we're not going to get THEM – like, giant ant stuff. We discussed this with Melanie Moses around the issue of vascularization and nutrient delivery in insects. But you take a different approach and you look at structural strengths and like the architecture of insect exoskeletons and of their musculature. I'd love to hear you unpack that a little bit because this is a really cool consideration when you're looking at like something like the size of a Hercules beetle and you're like, "Damn, that's a big thing." It's not going to get any bigger. And why?Chris: Yeah. Mimi Koehl did a lot of this work, almost all of this work for this paper in terms of thinking about these biophysical constraints in insects. From a very top level, what I would say is ... and we had a lot of conversations about this as a group internally, is that part of this is where the contingency does come into play, right? Once you're committed to a particular body plan or a particular set of structures or physiological traits, biomechanical traits, then the optimizations occur. The evolutionary optimizations again, random process over time, that's how the optimization is happening. Those occur contingents on having a particular structure or body plan. And so the constraints that are going to be optimized for an exoskeleton and the types of things you have to put into your evolutionary optimization problem there is very different than an endoskeleton, right?If you have an internal skeleton like mammals, you're going to face different optimization challenges then if you have an exoskeleton. I think that's a lot of what we wanted to think through. That's actually where some of the contingency comes through is that you have to condition on knowing a particular structure of an organism.Michael: The one example that I really appreciated was that molting seems to limit the size of arthropods because everything has to reattach. There's a vulnerable phase there.Chris: Yeah. I thought that was one of the most interesting examples, right? That's because of this need to molt to get larger, you enter a phase of extreme predation risk relative to pre-molt. That then starts to interface with a bunch of niche considerations, behavioral strategies, right? Do you hide just after you've molted, how do you deal with some of those challenges? I think on one end of the spectrum, this is where we have this purely biophysical perspective. On the other hand, you have to think about the richness of interacting features. That's really what we're trying to get after in this paper is how do you do both, right? How do you start to separate out the purely biophysical optimizations you do for an organism and then all of these other rich considerations about behavior and niche and evolutionary history and so forth? I think the molting is a nice example of that.Michael: Just to get into like speculative biology here, some of these constraints lead to the transition point at which you start to see sociality in insects. Then similarly, different constraints seem to lead to sociality in endoskeletal vertebrate organisms and you get a breakdown where it goes from a “solid brain” as a computational entity to a “liquid brain.” I'm curious what constraints would have to be lifted mechanically in order to offer a much, much larger individual organism than anything that we see on the planet today? And then in terms of design, bioengineering, new forms of life, for other worlds. I mean obviously gravity is a constraint, available free energy as a constraint, but what within the organism itself do you see as something that can be changed on Earth's surface to yield a Godzilla type creature? Something that's vastly larger than anything we see in the fossil record or alive today.Chris: Yeah, so many answers to that. I mean changing gravity's the cop-out. It's true but that's easy one. Choosing to put everything in a liquid medium is another thing you could do to make really large organisms and we do see, yes that would be one possibility. But I think from this more general question of, okay if you wanted something with a particular function of endlessly-increasing size or as big as covering a planet or something like that, what are the challenges? If you wanted some sort of brain spanning an entire planet, what are the challenges there? I mean, I think a lot of the principles that start to come out and thinking about that are questions of transport, right? Just exchange. If you have lots of individual components doing simple computations, how do you wire all those together?Melanie Moses has done a lot of work on that and thinking about chip architecture and certain scaling laws there. That certainly becomes a challenge in terms of how do you wire all these things together? How do you get information from A to B and at what timescales? Then there's a rate question for the overall system and then there's an energy flux question. So I think there are calculable questions about what would be the maximum number of bits you could … What’s the maximum computation rate of a planetary surface given solar flux, right? I think that's a calculable thing if you make some assumptions about different types of architecture and then start to work through the exchange problems and so forth.Now maybe not, in terms of how complicated the algorithms would need to be or there might be a whole algorithms-combined-with-architecture optimization there that I don't know if there's an answer to. But I think yeah, in terms of the things that you want to relax, you also want to relax competition because a lot of the things that you would do optimally, you can't if there are other species competing against you. Having a small mobile brain inside a skull that can easily run is a nice way to protect that brain from predators. But if you don't have any predators then you can start to do all things with your morphology wouldn't have to otherwise. We talked about that a little bit with the insect case, right? That certain things that you decide to do are all about predator evasion, right? They're not most efficient for slow speed locomotion. They're all set so that I don't get eaten when a predator comes, right? I'll sacrifice a little bit of day-to-day efficiency as long as I can evade a predator. Those are part of the constraints are actually the ecological contingencies.Michael: This seems to tie into ... I hate to say this but it seems to lend some credence to predictions made by people like Nick Bostrom that the future of the biosphere is a singleton. It's just like one giant creature that is in competition with nothing. I mean that's been a prognostication of various troubled legacies of evolutionary thinkers like Teilhard de Chardin for decades. But it  sounds like you think that may hold some water.Chris: I don't know. I mean a few counterpoints to that one would be I think it's a possible evolutionary end point. I would say the challenge of exterminating all bacteria is daunting, right? I mean the number of environments you find bacteria living in, how deep in the subsurface active bacteria are found, how long that seems to have been going from lots of recent cores people have done of finding all different fossils, microbial fossils. I would say that they're likely to always be around the task of getting rid of all bacteria to me almost seems impossible. Whether that's bacteria and a singleton that to me seems like a more likely endpoint than just a singleton.Also getting to a singleton, I just don't know how stable certain trajectories towards that actually are, right? I don't know how stable a species like ours is right, in terms of all the hurdles that would need to be overcome to go that direction. All of the various ethical and aesthetic considerations we might make in the future about what kind of ecology we want. That may not necessarily be the end point. And also, yeah you have to always think about anytime you have a singleton, what's the likelihood of something invading? If a singleton goes for a long time without competitors, it may start to optimize itself for efficiency in ways that make it very susceptible to invaders. Then the question is just, is there an invader, is there another species around that can start to invade in that niche and that is likely to be true especially if there's a huge seed population of bacteria around. So yeah, I don't know how either likely or stable a singleton is. I see lots of problems for it.Michael: To wrap that back around to the earlier pieces of this conversation, it seems as though really like a s  ingleton would presuppose or evoke the same kind of challenges that you get into with these limits to cell size and that it may be that what we're talking about is not some hypothetical future, but actually again the viability of a global economy — and why it seems like we're under such pressure now, simultaneously, to try and integrate all of these different local economies at the same time that we are casting our glance to other worlds, to invoke again the InterPlanetary Festival thing. Maybe the answer is multicellularity and it's not that really this kind of thing isn't feasible. That like you said, it's too complicated. It's too vulnerable without the competition. Yeah. Anyway.Chris: Yeah, I think the other thing to point out there too that's really interesting is that many of the evolutionary transitions that we've seen haven't eliminated the life that they evolved from. Bacteria and Archaea become, unicellular eukaryotes, they aren’t then outcompeted by unicellular eukaryotes. Right, in the same size ranges because they do have some overlap in size. They can live in the same environments. There's coexistence of these, these very diverse things. Multicellulars don't out-compete the unicellulars. You get coexistence. And so I think that's a really interesting thing that even with these radical shifts in architecture and huge transitions in evolution, they don't then exclude everything that came before. In some cases.Michael: So we are the microbiome of civilization, roughly speaking? Well, okay. Thanks for indulging all that. What's next for you? Like where is this research taking you now and what are you working on?Chris: Yeah I mean, I'd say it's a few main directions. One is as we start to understand these different physical constraints and what they mean for organisms and scaling laws, how much can we start to then generalize or abstract that to think about life that's not  like the one we already have? Can we generalize some of those ideas so that we get away from exactly the physiology of all known organisms that we have and start to think about life in general — which I'm interested in both for astrobiological questions and also origins of life questions.I think that's one program. Another program is really thinking about continuing to connect biophysics and evolution together. There's lots of people now starting to work on this in lots of interesting ways. There's a really interesting classic literature on all of this.I think that's another really interesting direction to go is to say, “We have this huge body of evolutionary theory. We're now starting to see where the physical constraints come in. How do we start to put all that together to get a more predictive power, more universal theories of biology?”Michael: Wonderful. Chris. It's a pleasure. Actually it's always a pleasure to talk to you.Chris: Yeah, thanks.Michael: Where would you tell people to follow up if they're interested in this kind of stuff?Chris: I don't have a great answer for that.Michael: I mean, obviously they can go to the SFI website.Chris: Yeah. We'll look into the SFI website, follow the SFI Twitter. That's all I have. David Krakauer and I have a paper that hopefully will be coming out soon and so there's lots of interesting, more on this generalizing life question. Yeah, lots of things coming soon.Michael: Wonderful. Thanks.
17,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Kirell Benzi, it's a pleasure to have you on Complexity Podcast.Kirell: Thank you very much for hosting me.Michael: Yeah. So, this is a little bit more off-the-cuff than I'm used to with this show. You just came and gave a very interesting presentation on your work here at the Santa Fe Institute, but I haven't had weeks to steep myself in your thesis and publications and prior work like I normally do. So, I hope that our listeners enjoy something a little bit more informal and free-wheeling.But let's start with your history, your background. You talk a little bit about this on the site, but I'd be curious to know what inspired you to get into data art in the first place, in your childhood and in your PhD program, and so on. What brought you to the point that you are today?Kirell: Okay. So, I started doing digital art when I was really young, I would say, but I was always fascinated by computers. I quickly oriented myself towards a career in software engineering first, and then I decided to do a PhD in Data Science.But I was missing this part of myself that I used to like, which was about passion and art. What I said in the talk is that people have been asking me, "So, what are you doing?" And I was not really sure the best way of explaining them what I was actually doing. They were asking me this just out of courtesy, they were not really interested in what I was doing.So, I realized, "Okay, maybe I should start to visualize stuff and get interested in the field of data visualization." Then I realized, "Okay, but what I do could maybe be turned into something more aesthetic, artistic."And in fact, it all started with the publication I did on Star Wars, my favorite universe. And at the time, there was a lot of coverage, actually, all over the world. People were saying in the comments, "Oh, look at this amazing, beautiful data visualization."To me, when I look at it, it's like, "It's not beautiful. It's something that we do here every day in network visualization." And so, "Okay, maybe if there's an interest here, I should investigate that and see if I can reconcile both my early passion and what I do right now."And this is how I really started  to think of new ways to basically do science communication, using art. And this is where I am today, trying to blend both worlds, basically.Michael: So, actually, I would love for you to get into a little more detail about the Star Wars project, because just the methodology of it. This is dipping into a broader question, and I think this would be a good example of this broader question, which is: as you mentioned in your talk today, often, data visualization and data art are about selecting the relevant data.I used to work as a scientific illustrator, and the reason that I was still getting jobs in an era of photography and high-resolution mechanical imaging was because these photographs have too much information. So, it seems like a huge piece of what you're doing is actually coarse-graining and down-sampling and deciding what information counts and what doesn't, and how that works in telling a story.So, let's dive into that through this particular project, and why you selected the data points you did, and so on.Kirell: Okay. So, the Star Wars project, just to recap, the idea was to create a network of characters, of all the Star Wars characters. So, just a quick precedent here. You know that Star Wars, now, has been bought by Disney, right? And what I did was in the Star Wars Expanded Universe, which is not canon anymore.So, just for the fans here, I'm just [laughs] … Okay, so the expanded universe includes the movies, of course, but the books, the video games, anything, everything related to Star Wars.So, the idea was to go on this website, Wookieepedia. It's a Wikipedia, but only for Star Wars. If you go on there now, you would find that it's more than 150,000 pages being created by people, referencing the characters, of course, but the planets, the factions, everything about Star Wars.And being a huge fan, to me, was the perfect opportunity to get some of the data, because it's free, basically, and create this network of characters. The idea is that first, you have to index all the characters in this universe. It was not that easy to do. So, I had to write a small Python program, a robot to basically crawl and get all the pages.Then, on each biography, the idea is to look for other names. Because now you have this index of all the characters, so you can look whether or not one of the characters is cited in the biography. So, it means that probably they interacted in some way. But we have to be careful in the Star Wars universe that, you know, there's ghosts, so phantoms can appear 3000 years later.So, it's not the same as with our own real history, just for the fact that Star Wars spans over 37,000 years of history. So, it's very big.The idea here was that as a scientist, this was really all so interesting, because now, if you start to develop new tools and algorithms to explore this fictional universe, you could apply exactly the same tools for our own real universe.But because it's very difficult to get sometimes ... like, imagine in the Middle Ages, if you’re in Europe, and you have to get all the different languages, they are basically gone. No one speaks them anymore.So, just to get the data and digitize them, and be able to explain stuff, it's very difficult, and it's not exactly my core study. So, I said, "Okay, let's focus on developing new tools and methods to get on this easy, I would say fictional universe, because it's in English. It's accessible, you get it on the web.”And then, try to find ... I know it's interesting, clusters, points, something that would actually make sense. When I started doing this project, it was really about giving an idea of how big the universe was. And it's actually very big. It's more than 20,000 characters. This is why it got a lot of coverage at that time, it was because it was the first time we could have an idea of how big the Star Wars Expanded Universe was. So, this is how it started.And then, people have been making comments that, "Oh, this is beautiful." It was not artistic at that time, and then I started to improve on the visualization techniques to make it more emotional. And this is basically how I started to work and to do data art.Michael: So, what were those improvements? What did you tweak in order to make the work more emotionally compelling?Kirell: Okay, so first … okay, this is my personal preferences, right? But first, use a black background to make it more dramatic, I would say. But it's not only that.So, here, if you look it up, the shape of the network is really ... It's difficult to describe, but all the principal characters at the center of the piece, and as you would go around, so the less and less popular characters are spread out in a way that it reminds you of, like in a galaxy, I would say, but not as a starry night. It's something more ... I don't know, that draws the audience into the piece.Then, to create this effect, I basically had to tweak the network visualization techniques, because if you use them in a standard scientific way, you will always get more or less the same shapes. Part of my job now is to take some algorithms that we use in science, but basically tweak them, break them, and change them to create emotional pieces, which cannot really be created just out of the box with the standard techniques, because in these techniques, you want to highlight particular clusters or artifacts, or things that are interesting for scientists to see in the data.But here, because it goes to create more emotions, you want to maybe even focus more on the shapes overall. What is the effect the piece has when you look at it from afar, from up close? And it's not necessarily the best way to represent it as scientific data, but maybe it's another way, an interesting way, to get the audience attracted to the whole idea of data art itself, and at the end, on the scientific part, like techniques that we use to create the piece.Michael: So, one of the things that I'm curious about, but I don't remember you mentioning in the talk, was the edge lengths in this. Is that based on the number of co-occurrences, or was that an artistic decision?Kirell: That's a very good question. In network vis, the problem is that because the network is an ND, n-dimensional space, the number of nodes, you have to make an embedding into 2D or 3D. So, you have to make compromises.If the graph is not really planar, there's no way you can embed it and keep all the distances perfectly correct. So, you have to make compromises, and what the algorithm will try to do is minimize the edge length to have something centered. Even most pieces will actually be centered around that circle shape.So, you have to break that, but in this particular case, no. The edge length doesn't mean ... it's a way to embed it into the plane. And the cool thing about this is, because it doesn't really represent the similarity, or just distance, is that you can put the nodes a bit where you want, so you can create more dramatic effect by using this particular property of the graph.So, no. In this particular case, no. Some other cases, because they are planner, you can do this.Michael: So, two things came up for me, watching you speak about this particular project, one of which was, recently we had Matthew Jackson of Stanford on. You know he does network economic research. In his book, The Human Network, there's a chapter where he's explaining the different kinds of network centrality, and how those different kinds of centrality quantify different kinds of social influence that a person has, and how those different kinds of influence relate to one another.He gives a really profound example of the de Medici family, and he shows how de Medici was not powerful on certain measures, didn't have the most wealth, wasn't, in one sense, the most important character to everyone else in Florence at the time. But if you look at the network map, then you actually see that he and his family, through intermarriages, stood at the very center of that map.It's akin to, especially the way that you said you wrote this bot that scraped Wookieepedia, it's scraped by taking hot links between names of the different characters, and this reminded me of the text modeling work done by another one of our external professors, Simon DeDeo, and how he's used text modeling in this way, through historical documents, like the parliamentary papers during the French Revolution to model who held the most influence at any given time.So, I'm just curious how much that ... other than simply revealing a beautiful image, how much the narrative component of it and the revelations of creating a map like this figure into the way that you think about this? And if you've been working with researchers like Simon and Matt, what kind of stuff has come out of that? What kind of insights?Kirell: It's interesting because you were talking about centrality, and it's something that I use all the time, in all of my networks, basically as a prior to layout the piece. So, that's very important information to be able to decipher, because it's very big, right? Who are the main protagonists, modern characters?So, in the Star Wars piece, of course you would expect this to be the Emperor, and Darth Vader, because they are the most connected. They have actually the highest score. You have different measure of centrality, but in this particular case, they were the highest, for both of these characters.So, this is a very important measure, and we use it all the time. I have another example of this, a funny one.When I was doing my PhD, you know, every four years there's a new president at EPFL. I had to make a piece, actually, on EPFL staff. So, I used the same techniques to try to understand who was the most central character, and it turns out that this character became president of EPFL.Michael: After?Kirell: After, and didn't know about this. But it's very interesting, because you say, that's surreal. So, he had the most connection with everyone in the school, and at the same time, he had one of the highest numbers of citations. You could say, "For once, we can use these network measures to understand and to vote for a new president." Of course, it was not the case, but I think it was an interesting fact that, basically, it was pure merit in this case, according to this network, a centrality measure.To create this network, what we did was to extract all the papers from all the scientists over the ... EPFL is actually a pretty young university. Last year was its 50th anniversary. But we took all the papers, and found out ... so, connected them by co-citations on all the actors at the EPFL, and we found out more of the core professors were very connected and they were competing for the presidency at some point!So, it was funny. And also, this now-president-of-EPFL, has also the highest number of patents. So I made another piece, which he has in his office, and the funny thing is, it's a nice way to highlight, "You're here, and you are the most connected, because you have one of the top three number of patents."And so, this kind of measure there, they really mean something in the real world. It's not just something that we use as a scientific tool. But as you can see here, it represents a real reality that we can chase, basically, what's happening.So, I'm not sure if that answers your question, but it's something that I use all the time, because it's something that, when we interact as humans, basically, if you have connections, if you have influence, if you have followers, anything, it means something. It is a way of characterizing this influence.Michael: It does seem like the question of whether it is or is not an ethical tool, to select people who might be eligible for a promotion, I think, there is always that…Kirell: It is catchy, okay. But it's interesting. It's a measure. Then we decide collectively whether or not we want to use it, whether or not it's ethical or not, but it exists, and it represents a part of reality.Michael: Right next to this is the work that you did for the Montreux Jazz Festival, which I thought was just extraordinary, because it's taking a similar approach and then using it to draw this map of influence and collaboration of all of these amazing musicians that people will recognize. I would love to hear you talk a little bit more about your relationship with Montreux and with how you built this thing, and then the dome installation. This is a very, very cool project.Kirell: Okay, so the collaboration is between the Montreux Jazz and the EPFL, which is in charge of digitizing all the archives. So basically the story of the Montreux Jazz is, it's a very famous music festival. It's been on for 43 years now, I think.The creator of the festival had all the archives in his chalet in Montreux, which is next to Lausanne in Switzerland. The thing is, what happens if there's a fire? We lose something that is invaluable, right? So, the idea was, okay, maybe we should involve another university, because it's nonprofit, right? to be able to digitize and let people create new research projects out of this data, and also let people explore and be able to listen to the concert, watch them, and things like this.So, this collaboration, we started a long time ago. Basically, seven years ago. I did part of my PhD, also, on this data set that was really interesting. I created some databases about the location of all the artists and the connection, in terms of musical similarity. So, here for this, we had to extract the notes, the rhythm, using the machine learning to match artists if they sound the same.Michael: And this is sort of similar to Pandora's recommendation algorithm?Kirell: Yes, or Spotify, exactly. And actually, back in the day, we made a startup about doing music recommendations, which actually was really cool. Didn't really succeed in the end, but we had some cool ideas. And if I might say, they are not still there yet.So, I'm just going to give you, because I'm teasing you, I'm going to give you one idea that we had, and maybe if some guy from Spotify listens to this, okay, man, you can take it. But the idea was this: you could select any artist or any song that you liked, and it would give you the best transition between all of them.So, it means you could start with metal and jazz, and say, "Give me a playlist that is smooth to the ear," and it would gradually go from one song to the other. I don't think this exists here yet.Michael: I think the world has already been super-saturated with human DJs, so we might as well put at least a few of them out of work, yeah. [laughs]Kirell: Yeah. It wasn't the idea, but … and the thing is, you could add three, four key points. Now, I want to start the party at 8:00, when guests come in, there's some smooth jazz music, but at 10:00, I want to dance, and I don't want to be around my iPhone trying to play and switch. So, let it do automatically all the work.So, it was a cool idea, and it was a research project. This started from the Montreux Jazz because it's a live concert. It's not exactly the same version that you would have found in studio albums, so we needed a way to be able to explore this data set, and for that, we needed to be able to recommend it to people.So, what we did is we created this app, and at the Montreux Jazz Festival, people could listen and create these kinds of playlists between all the music from the concert. Just to give you an idea, there's more than 40,000 songs already in the Montreux Jazz, and exclusive. You cannot listen to them anywhere else. It's really cool, you know, like a Sting version of something, then you would go to Queen.So, I had access to all these songs, but of course, I could not keep them. That would've been great.So, this was the idea. And so, for the dome installation, it's a collaboration, I would have to say, with Professor Sarah Kenderdine, which is actually in charge of the ArtLab Museum at EPFL. It's a museum dedicated to the collaboration between projects between art and science, and we did this with the company that I'm currently working with, ekino.We created this installation with them, basically. We have this big network of all the artists that played in the jazz, and you connect them if they're being played together on stage in one particular concert. But because the artists come, each year, Friends and the BB King came 13 times in the Montreux Jazz, each time when he came, he brought a new set maybe, of one different drummer, and different bassist, different guitarist.So, when you connect them all together, you would find that they create this very high concentrated community around very key, central artists, and would connect every artist in the Montreux Jazz, because they all know each other at some point. If you go look at the core of the network, like the most connected person, if you look at the music genre, you would find that it's mostly jazz or blues, because the music itself calls for collaboration. You want to do a jam, you want to invite people going on stage and playing. "Let's do this song, this classic."This is why, over time, over 50 years of data, you connect and you have a very large connected network of artists. So, this installation is interactive. It means that you can play it. It's like a small planetarium, I would say. It's a full dome installation, and you basically look up. We have this spherical controller that we built, and then when you move it around, you have this fish-eye effect. So you can zoom on part of the network, and when you click, of course you would go to the artist, and then all these concerts. Then you can basically play each concert, or each song of each concert.Michael: One of the things that I like about this is, like you said, a lot of people were swapping band members and bringing in new people. We all know BB King, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Santana, but I love that this allows you to be like, "Oh my God, that bassist is really good. I'm going to follow that bassist over a decade and see all of the gigs that they played with everyone else."Kirell: Exactly.Michael: That is something that the typical ways that we tell history tend to ... you know, the human compression algorithm, or whatever, the way that we have to reduce things into narrative makes it so that history is told by the winners. But then here's an opportunity to tell the story in a hundred different ways that are not about the star players, that are about these people that are largely in the background.And so, in a way, this kind of research seems really hopeful to me for not  just identifying who has the greatest influence, but identifying who has been standing behind those people.Kirell: Exactly.Michael: And then, of course, dome installations are just awesome.Kirell: Yes. They're actually very hard to create. It's also expensive to move them around, of course, as you would expect. It's difficult because you have to be able to look at the piece in every angle. You can have a 360 view of the whole piece, and so, in terms of interaction, for instance, like when you play a video, how do you make sure that people can see it in the correct angle all over the dome?So, what we did was to put them into circles and have different circles rotated so that wherever you stand in the dome, you can still see correctly, the whole concert.So, it was a bit challenging in terms of the organization, instead of just having a screen that everyone knows about.Michael: So, I want to jump here, because another part of your presentation was about faces, and using GANs to create artwork. This was really different than the network architecture diagrams. I'd love to hear you talk more about using artificial intelligence to make data art, and how you see this as an extension, because it seems to me like it involves a good deal more artistic discretion, and it's a lot less of a strict adherence to data visualization. And so, I'd love to hear how you got into this, and how you've been working in that space, as well.Kirell: Okay. You are absolutely right. It's different, because if you look at the result of a GAN, it doesn't tell you anything about the data underlying. It might be …Michael: Maybe the best thing to do is assume no knowledge on the part of the listener, and talk a little bit about this particular technology.Kirell: Okay. The idea here is you have two networks, so it's artificial intelligence, this machine learning algorithm that allows you to basically synthesize new faces, images, sounds, anything, basically.First you have to train it. You give him a lot of images. In this particular example, there's actually a thousand different objects that you give it, give as an input. The idea is that you train it to be able to understand what an image is, as you would do with your own eyes, right? So, I don't know, decipher the color, the shape, the pattern, the textures.And once the network knows about this, there's another one just behind it, that actually tries to mimic and to generate fake data. This is the first one, sorry. And the second one tries to identify whether or not the image that you generate is true or fake.So, at the beginning, it's generating noise. So, of course the other network that's a discriminator would say, "No, it's fake. It's not a real dog," for instance.But as the algorithm improves, because both are training next to each other, they converge to something. At the end, when you do the training right, the images that you generate are so close to the real images that the discriminator cannot say whether or not this is fake or real. And this is how you can synthesize deep fakes, for instance.Now, with the technology that we have right now, the images that we create are so realistic that most people will not ... you have to really look very closely to see if something is wrong, but otherwise, if you just look at it like this, you would say, "Yeah, it's a picture."So, this is the idea of GANs, but you can use GANs to synthesize new sound, for instance. People have been doing this with classical music, and being able to generate Bach-like ... it's like, and it's not the real deal. But it's, I would say, for people who are not really trained into classical music, it would sound like what Bach would do, right?So, it's an interesting technology. And here, the idea is, "How can we leverage this technology to talk about artificial intelligence in general, and get people interested into learning more about it, and not being scared by the headlines that we hear all the time?”Right? ”I'm going to be replaced by a robot," and then you have The Terminator as an image. It's always like this. [laughs] No?And then also, you have people like our digital influencers that talk about it, but they are not really qualified to talk about it. And then, because they have 300,000 followers, what they say carries some weight.So, the idea here is, "Okay, maybe it's better for you to get your opinion from yourself, so get interested into knowing it, because we're going to use AI a lot more in the future. It's going to be everywhere. So, better know it now and not be scared, because we're always scared of something we don't understand."And the idea to get people interested into learning more about it is to, "Okay, maybe can we create artistic shapes, based on the same technology, and see that it's not that scary after all?" So, this is how I started to ...It's based on data art, because you need data to train the whole neural network, and you also need data to generate new images, faces or abstract images. But as you said, it's not actual depictions of the underlying data that you have. It's more creative, I would say, representation.Michael: I'm reminded, I forget who the team was that actually did this, but a couple years ago, somebody fed hundreds of thousands or millions of training images into an algorithm that was supposed to spit out what the internet looks like, and it was a cat. It had made its own cat image. [laughs]And that's a little bit of a ridiculous example, but it got a lot of traction in the press. In that sense, there does seem to be a really obvious link. Like your biography says, that the purpose of data art is to render a hidden mass visible. And so, in that sense,  again, it's about reducing the number of dimensions so that it's actually something that a human can comprehend, that there's something about trying to imagine the internet as like what Rice University philosopher Timothy Morton would call a hyperobject, something that is so fast and so extensive in time, and so many-dimensional that it's impossible for us to conceive.And so, how you do that in an honest way is a really interesting question. You've done some really interesting work on GANs, like the GAN that you trained on plastic trash, and then gave an image of, was it Dubai?Kirell: Yes, yes. But you cannot say it. I'm not sure if we can. I don't want to offend the people over there, but … [laughs]Michael: Well, we're all full of microplastics at this point, but Dubai is not unique in that regard.But at any rate, I'm curious how else you've applied this particular technique in order to make a statement that is still beholden to scientific standards? This is an area where, like I said, I think you have a lot more room to play artistically. But I'm curious what kind of scientific messages you're trying to communicate with this specifically? Other than just, "You should be more interested in AI."Where else do you think this is viable?Kirell: Do you mean for a specific piece, for instance, like in this Dubai and trash thing. This technique was not actually, again, it was like a style transferred. So, the idea is you ... well, it's still artificial neural networks, but the idea is you have this original image that you like. You also have an image of an artist or a texture, basically any other images, and the network will try to combine both so they keep their original, say, topologies, like structure of the photo that you input.But at the same time, replacing the texture and the pattern with the other artistic images. And so, what I did for this Dubai thing was to take a picture of basically plastic bottle and trash, and it would stylize the buildings in Dubai, in having this very disgusting plastic effect. But which was the idea, right?And the idea was, of course, to talk about global warming, what we do with plastic, pollution, ocean pollution, anything like this. And I would say in this regard, the message here is more artistic in a way, that it's a way to communicate a message about, "Okay, maybe I should not trash, put my plastic bottle in the sea. Maybe I should put it in the garbage bin."But I'm not sure if that answers your question, or ...Michael: Well, I'm reminded of a friend of mine, who came up to SFI from San Francisco last spring, and took the massive NVIDIA face set of all the fake faces that had been generated, and then was able to use, let's say, someone and their romantic partner, and then was able to search that database and pull the faces that were most like their intersection, so you actually get some clue as to what your child might look like as an adult.Kirell: Yes, we did those kind of experiments, yes. It's very interesting, especially with the beautiful celebrities, which, "Oh, yeah, I should definitely marry, alright, because our children would look so beautiful."Michael: Right, better than consulting the astrologer.Kirell: Yes, if we meet, we have to go in L.A. in secret. No.But yeah. So, we did those kind of experiments, and what we can do now is if you can even upload the picture of yourself and see how the network will actually re-synthesize it. So, it's not perfect, but it's also interesting, because you can age yourself, or get younger, and some old kind of experiment.And I think there was this FaceApp now, that you can download. It was a bit of a controversy, because you're not really sure ... basically, you have to put your phone number, I think, or your email, and you're not really sure where the images of your face go. So, there was the big backlash over …Michael: Yeah, that one and Zao, right? There's the question of whether the Russians and Chinese are using this to train their own networks to accomplish some other unrelated …Kirell: Probably, right?Michael: Yeah. But I guess what I'm getting at is a little bit more of a speculative question, which is, how do you imagine that this kind of thing, like virtual breeding, not just of people, but of ideas, of data sets, and so on, might be used to help people make better predictions in the future, or to achieve other … Like, it is a little bit more artsy, but it does seem like it could be wielded in a really interesting way toward pointing people toward a productive avenue of research. I'm just curious. Yeah, just off the cuff.Kirell: Yeah, it's a difficult question. I think part of data art is about this, about getting people interested, and giving a message. But at the same time, it's very difficult to speculate about what the future may be, right? And at the same time, because you introduce bias, because if you put in a certain direction, people will ask you ... and actually, I've had this question last week. People have been asking me, “But are you manipulating people by selecting just part of the data, some of the subset, and showing …?”And I was like, "Yeah, but it's in a good way, because I'm legit, right? I'm a scientist, so it's ... " And of course, it's not a very good answer. But the thing is, there's always a bias. If you do any kind of visualization, you actually take a stand. There's no true objectivity anywhere.When you read a newspaper, it's far from being objective. So, there's always our own bias that comes into play. So, I think it could be used, but I think the main thing here is that we could appreciate anything, but you be wary of, "Okay, there have been some trade-offs here.” And this is why it's better to get interested in the field, so you can make sure that you make the right assumptions, and you're not being manipulated too much," because otherwise you will always have this question of, "Who is this guy? Is it really legit, or is it trying to manipulate me into doing something?”Maybe it's stealing my data, right? I have this question all the time. "Oh, but you're stealing data!" No, I'm not. But it's difficult, especially for the general public and audience, that they don't really understand necessarily all these questions. If you have a headline, "Facebook lost 150 million passwords," then it's very hard to come in and say, "Yeah, but I do art with big data." You see the point, right?So, I don't know, we need more of this, but it's not really objective.Michael: Yeah. So, this seems to touch in on a question I asked the SFI Facebook group, if they had any questions for you, right before we got onto this. And one of them came from one of our volunteer moderators, Tim Clancy.So, he says, "We often over-focus on techniques in the sciences, but sometimes the best advice comes from approaches that are technique-generic, how to define a problem, how to understand audiences, identify boundaries, et cetera." And he wanted to know, do you have advice on improving communication with data art, things to consider? And noodle, before diving in with a specific technique or presentation style.I mean, obviously, the question of, "Am I creating an emotionally manipulative movie trailer that's going to make you cry no matter who you are?" And, "Who am I serving with this?" You just addressed that, but zooming out a little furth er, I think what he might be asking is in part, are there consistencies in the heuristics that you use to determine what data you leave in, what you exclude, how you decide to represent these things?Kirell: It's very difficult. I found ... how would I say that? So, obviously, there are some dimensions that are interesting to explore because they have more variability, for instance. This is good. You know that if there's a big change, it's going to be interesting visually. If it's average, and everything is very similar to each other, then it's going to be very cluttered, and it's not going to be very interesting.So, I would say that you try to look for dimensions that are interesting to visualize, and have more variability.But other than that, yeah, as you said, it's about who is the target audience, and what are their backgrounds? So, it's a bit difficult if you make an art piece, because you cannot really choose the audience. But when you give presentations, this is why I give presentations, because I think it's easier to understand the whole data art thing if you have the guy explaining to you, not necessarily what it means, but how it was made, actually. So, to get interested in the science. We go back to this.I'm not sure if I have anymore techniques in sort of regular database principles. So, the audience, the storytelling part, who is it for? Then, "Okay, what dimensions could be interesting to visualize?" And how they relate to the original storytelling and message that I wanted to make.This is what we do all the time in data vis. If you do data journalism, for instance, on The New York Times, before trying to do anything, they have ID, and they have to validate whether or not it works in the data. But I would say it's a bit different than what we do in scientific visualization. Here we explore data, and then we find new patterns, and then we investigate. But in most articles that you see online, they already have a headline, so they know what they are looking for.It doesn't mean that you cheat. It doesn't mean that you select part of the data. It just means that you always have an opinion. You cannot make something out of being completely objective.So, I don't necessarily have a technique. I would say it's tentative, I don't know, techniques that we have, but not something specific. I don't know.Michael: Leading with the opinion, versus finding results in the data, is that the only difference, or are there other significant differences between communicating to a scientific audience, versus communicating to the general public?Kirell: If you talk to a scientific audience, it's going to be tougher, as we saw today in the talk. [laughs] Because they know me. And it's a legitimate question they want to ask. "Okay, but is it really useful? Do we have a market for these kinds of work?" And of course, the answer is yes.But as you can see, for instance, a lot of exhibition, even trade shows, see as they add some artistic data visualizations. So, there's a market, of course.But when you talk to the general public, think about it. If you go to a museum, how often do you read the description? Right? Not that much.So, how can you make sure that your piece stands out? You need to have something, a good impact, a strong impact visually, to make sure that people, at least they go towards the room because they see it from afar.Then, you have to make sure that they read the description, which is very difficult to do. Sometimes I go undercover, and I look at people, and I see that they don't read the description, and I'm pissed off, because I'm like, "Read it. It's better." Half of the work is in the description, because you understand that it's real.This is why I switched to a different approach, and try to talk and to explain the pieces, because then you cannot skip me, basically. You have to listen to what I say.It's not the same approach. You have one message. If you want to make it in front of a general audience, you have to be very clear about the message that you want to ... and people, basically they take what they want from the piece. Sometimes they only like the aesthetics. I've been running a study and asking people whether or not the message was important, and people said yes. But of course, some of them said, "No. Just if it's beautiful, I like it." It's cool, but it's not exactly the point.But for a scientific audience here, they have this analytic mind, and it's good, right? So, they have to know whether or not it's efficient, whether or not people will like it, and this is why I started this data art study. I have more or less a scientific study, on whether or not people find value in data art, and what is this value?For instance, people have been saying, "Okay," the question was, "Is it different from other visual arts? And does it add something from other visual arts?" And people have been saying yes at 75%. So, it's a very small number of participants, 200, I'm sorry. But it's growing.I find it interesting. This is why I try to approach, also, data art as a scientific practice, and people have been actually publishing papers in the datavis community about this. So, people are interested in the effect, the perception that we have, and I'm trying to be in both worlds.So, when I talk to scientists, I have to show data, facts. When I talk to the general audience, I just have to show emotions and have something compelling, so people will actually go and read the whole thing.Michael: So, it seems like in both cases, and I think we've been kind of dancing around this the whole time: in both cases, it has to do with how much information a person can take in at any given time, and how the way that you represent that information is able to exploit people's attentional biases.It's common. In journalism, they say, "You don't ask more than three questions in a row." I forget who it was, but it was an interesting project that I circulated in-house, here at SFI, where this team had redesigned the poster presentation at scientific conferences so that it was just very bold and colorful, and actually very low information content, and then it pointed people to all of this stuff on some website that you could go to if you really wanted to know more. It became more of an advertisement for the research than an attempt to cram everything onto a poster, at which point you're just lost in the noise at these conferences.All of that information just becomes like television static.Kirell: Exactly. And you know when you go to conferences, there's a best poster award. And usually, the winners are the ones who have less text, more visuals, and link to the actual papers, and a QR code, or something like this.So, I think there's a nice blend between ... it would be good to have designers also help scientists to make more impactful communication, because otherwise it's a lot of text, as you said. Do you want to go close, read? It's font 8, and you have to read all the ... it's not very fun, until you talk to the guy. But it's very noisy.So, it's not very efficient. No, it's true, right? So, here we tried the opposite approach. We give something very visual, and we let people, if they're really interested in it, look it up online.Michael: So, this seems to be how you would articulate this argument, that you pointed to at the end of your talk, where you said, "It's becoming more and more important for people to take seriously the science that suggests this as an improvement on communication techniques."And specifically, when it comes to the people that are reviewing hundreds and hundreds of research grant applications, for example, how do you get your project to the top of that stack? How do you get people to actually pay attention to you?To me, as someone with a background in both  the arts and sciences, it seems obvious. But I just want to hear more from you about how this seems like you're on the winning side of history here, insofar as, the design is now a part of the way that we have to even request for the kind of support that it requires to do this research, and that there's an arms race going on here in an attention-starved global system that, in a weird way, is bringing art and science back under the same roof as necessary facets of each other's work.Because frankly, as an artist and designer, if you don't include the scientific, it also is not as strong. I know a lot of fine artists whose work I love, but at the same time, I don't think their work has the broad appeal, the stickiness, the depth that it could if it were touching into this other stuff as well.So, you said you've got friends that are researching this right now? What are their findings?Kirell: Yeah. So, two things. Just in Europe, for instance, if you want to ask for a grant to conduct research, they ask you specifically, "What are you going to do to make sure that you communicate about this research?" And you have to justify it, otherwise you don't get the funding.So, this is something that, it's not made up. It's actually part of the papers ... things that you have to write to make sure that people will ... because it's tax payers money, right? So you have to make sure that they get something back.So, being able to do data art is actually most of my work, and clients are actually scientific institutions, and they use it to promote their papers.I had this professor asking me to create a piece, because he wanted to publish in Nature. And so, he'd say, "If I have a good, strong visual that makes sense because it's based on real data, I have a stronger chance of getting accepted, because it's always cool to have a nice visual to illustrate."So, data art, first of all, there's a market, but there's also a real appeal, and people understand this. Another facet is also social media, which is weird, if you think about it. But we are humans, right? We are scientists, but we still have Twitter.And something that I wanted to connect to is research, so it's something that is just starting, is how much social media changes the way you are cited, basically. So, people will scream, I think, when hearing this. It's like, "Yeah, but the real research is about the peer review, then real science." Yeah, of course, but I'm sure that if you have a guide making sure that you have good social communication, you would get cited more, just because you have more exposure. So, maybe the work is a bit less good than the others, but if they are better at communicating, you lose.Michael: Yeah, actually, I think there was ... James Evans, another one of our external professors, was on a team that published kind of related findings, looking at citation networks. You're looking at how people who publish at a prestigious institution might be publishing the same findings, more or less, as someone who's not. But then, again, it is an unpleasant fact of the world that these things matter.Kirell: Exactly. And also, not only in your name, because most things are double blind, but it's not really true. You know who the guy is. And so, depending on the institution, whether or not you're friends with the guy, it also has a big impact on the publication.Every scientist will know that sometimes you publish exactly the same paper, and you can get rejected for nothing. There was a study on NeurIPS acceptance rate, and they did a study where basically, they put the paper in two different sets of reviewers to see whether or not the paper was accepted. I think the result was actually weird. Half of the time, it would get rejected, and half of the time, it would get accepted. But for exactly the same paper, for the same conference. So, showing the randomness of acceptance.So you need other factors to also have your research shown to others. Now, it's cool. You have arxiv. You can put pre-prints online and let people decide whether or not it's worth it.But basically, the whole thing ties to how we now do science, because before, you had prestigious journals. It was very expensive. It's still very expensive to publish there.But now people are asking for more open access, open science, open data. So, I think this is shifting. In this world of, “anyone can publish,” you need also ways to stand out and strong visuals to make that people will actually read your paper. Because if you have 100,000 papers to read, you're human. You will find one that has a good title and nice images, and then you will start to read and see whether or not it's a good paper.So, I think as you said, now, we put art and science under the same roof, just to have our research discovered, I would say.Michael: So, Karen Rhodes was at your talk today, and she wanted me to ask you, when I pulled for follow up questions, she wanted me to ask you if you are aware of publications or data of some form that visualization actually helps people grasp and remember the information they're being presented with?Kirell: Yes. There is a nice paper, and I forget the name. It's called “Chart Junk, The Effect of Visual Embellishment,” so you can look it up online. I'm not sure. The idea was exactly this. It was not about data art, it was about datavis itself.Michael: "Useful Junk." Yeah, we'll link to this in the show notes.Kirell: And the idea was, so they took some illustration from journals, and they asked people, "So, there was a study," and whether or not the fact that it was embellished.So, there was like, if you look at the paper, you would see that one is a monster, because it's about monstrous costs, and the other one is just the same information as a simple, plain bar chart.And they asked people whether or not they remember, five minutes after, the information. People would say, "Okay, it's the same." But then they asked two or three weeks later whether or not they would remember what this was about, and as you would expect, the charts with the visual, the illustration or the funny things, it would help people remember the data and the subject much better.And this was also one paper that I used to motivate the data art study, basically. But there's a downside.So, it's good for impact and for engagement, but of course, if you now publish a new study on cancer research, and you put some meme with the data, it's not going to look serious. So, this is where you have to draw the line between being very serious and being able to communicate to a general audience, and I think we can find a common ground.So, basically helping scientists to learn more about datavis so they have better, effective charts, and keep the more ... I would say, funky, more beautiful visualizations for when you do mass communication. I'm not sure if that makes sense.Michael: Yeah. So, I think about this, to turn it inward on the scientific process, also, and not just about communicating results. There are Chernoff faces, which is this whole thing of, the fact that the human attentional system is tuned to face data.In particular, I gave David Krakauer here a copy of one of my favorite science fiction novels, Blindsight, by Peter Watts, in which one of the characters is a vampire, and his data visualization cockpit is tormented human faces. So, rather than graphs or various network diagrams, the best way for him ... and it's a dark joke on what is actually, probably, I would imagine, going to be a growing trend.And I'm curious what you think, because some of your stuff, your GANs, involved simulating human faces that, in theory, you could then use as templates for a much richer and higher-dimensional set of data than you might with some other forms of data visualization.And so, I'm curious, there's the sort of dark side of thispersondoesnotexist.com, is that you're going to start getting phone calls from people that don't exist, and so on. But the bright side is that we can really hijack the human bias for faces in a way that helps us learn, by representing data in the form of a face. And I'm just curious what you …Kirell: It's very meta, yeah, but it's cool. So, first, yeah, the deepfakes. It's going to be a real issue, we agree. The people, of course, are finding this. At the same time, people are generating faces, most are scientists, and at the same time, developing new techniques to check whether or not the image is fake or not.But yes, the biggest downside of this is that maybe video evidence would be gone, basically, because you can also, "No, it's fake. It's not me. It wasn't me." The song, right?Michael: Right, yeah.Kirell: So, this is a big issue. But of course, it's going to be cat and mouse. You play, and you have techniques that check whether or not this is fake or true.But it's always going to be like cyber security. You have a new uncrackable software. A week later, it's cracked. It’s going to be like this.And going back to your question, yes, we're very good at discerning if something is wrong with the face. And this is why, even with the most top movies in the Star Wars, for instance, there's some weird artifacts that we see, for instance, when they tried to make Carrie Fisher younger. It looks real, but there's something wrong. And I think it's the micro-expressions that are wrong. But as we develop the technology, we're going to be able to do something completely perfect.But I'm not sure if it's really ethical to play with faces. The cool thing is, because we're going to be able to create new faces, yeah, it will mean less bias for diversity. It's going to be helpful to be able to play with that. But I'm not really sure if we should.Michael: Yeah. You're right that it does get back to this issue of how much are we exploiting the viewer? But at the same time, there are so many issues now, involving radiation spills, or other forms of ecological catastrophe, or natural disasters, or whatever, that, because of the scale, or because of the abstraction of the issue, they don't register with people.So, I just think about what it's going to take to motivate people to act when ... I mean, I'm Luke Skywalker-ing here, on the edge of the dark side. But if you could make a face that is the Gulf of Mexico, and then …Kirell: No, I’m going to tell you, because what you're saying is exactly what the product that we had in mind for …So, we work with the committee that creates the paper for the COP25, that recommendation that we should keep under 1.5 degrees, and things like this. So, it's a committee, and they go to Europe, and they ask them, basically, to write the report. It's impossible, it's like 400 pages, and no one reads it, of course. There's no images, and there's very scientific plots that no one understands.And they say, "Okay." I've been contacted with one of those guys to create, "Let's see if we can make data art, to make the message be simpler."I had this idea of actually taking the face that you are looking at right now on Instagram, and having half of it completely ... because we have GAN, so we can get people older, younger, and transform them into monsters, and have somebody have a monstrous face that will grow according to the temperature rising, because we don't actually do much to reduce the pollution.So, I wanted to use that. I don't know. I didn't do it, but maybe you're right. It depends on what you want to do, because I want to get close to the scientific world, but in this case, maybe we just need to strike a big hit on the whole thing, and say, "We should use faces. People recognize faces. We should deform them and look ugly.” Like special effect makeup, when they create these horrible faces. And then, you have this tension, you don't like it, but at the same time, it's fascinating. And maybe this will help people act. But I don't know, maybe I should try it and see the reaction, right?Michael: Yeah. Well, I'm thinking of ... was it Japan? I forget who did it, where they took the speed limit signs and then, rather than it just flashing you and warning you when you're going over the speed limit, it had a smiley face that turned into a frowning face. It was just like a little cartoon, but they found that the social reinforcement of having even a cartoon smile at you when you're doing the responsible thing, or frowning at you when you're putting other people at risk, dramatic improvement over just threatening people with punishment.Kirell: The social pressure, because you recognize the face, right?Michael: Right. So, the thought of like, your virtual assistant, that most of us already have.Kirell: It's judging you.Michael: Yeah, but your virtual assistant is going to judge you. People opt in to this, that it becomes a gamified thing, like your diet. You would FaceApp, you would see yourself with acne, or with another 50 pounds, or whatever.I don't know. We're completely off-center from where this podcast normally goes, but I think that you work at such a juicy, interesting intersection of techniques and possibilities. So, thanks for indulging this.Kirell: Well, thank you very much.Michael: Yeah. What are you working on now? What's on the horizon for you?Kirell: So, two things. I'm still working with GANs. The thing is, for now, the GANs that we have are very low-res. The maximum resolution that we get is basically 1024 pixels square. So, it's not much. So, I've been investigating using other AI techniques to do super resolution, basically, so we have very high resolution onto a smaller model.And of course, creating more and more, I would say, artistic results from GANs, so it's something that you wouldn't necessarily recognize when you look at it. It could look beautiful, but you have no idea the different ingredients that composed this image, so you have to, once again, click and look it up. And it's, "Ah, it's funny. There's like 14% of jellyfish in this image.” And we see it, but, "Okay, maybe now that you tell me that there are some jellyfish in here, okay, I see it."So this is one part, and the other part that I'm really focusing on is going back to fractals, or math, because, as I said in the talk, it was popular in the late '80s, beginning of the '90s, and nothing happened afterwards. And now, the software that we have to create fractals is awesome. It's really, the possibilities are endless.What I try to do, because, okay, fractals are mathematical functions, but I work with data. So, I try to blend both fractals and data, so fractal data art. Wow, it's a fancy keyword. This is what I did with one piece: the image was generated by just fractals, but the animation itself was parameterized with data. So, if you look it up, the animation, one piece is about sea level increase, because the glaciers are melting, because it's global warming, as you know.So, the idea here is that the animation, you would see that something looks like a coral shape, more or less, and it would grow according to the increase of the sea level, basically. So, I tried to combine both data, and what I like about fractals is that the image, it's infinite resolution, basically. It's just, you need to have a very big computer.So, it's very aesthetic. People love fractals, but not the usual Mandelbrot things. There's something more ... you have to look it up, to see what people are doing. It's beautiful. So, people like it because it's beautiful, but at the same time, we give back meaning to this. You talk about math, you talk about data, and you have this animation. You have everything that you need. Something that moves, something that is beautiful, and that has meaning.So, this is something that I really want to investigate some more, because I find it really interesting.Michael: Yeah, that piece in particular actually reminded me of, if you know Scott Draves, Electric Sheep? So, back in 2005, he started doing this screensaver that … everyone running this screensaver was contributing to the computation of the next few seconds of the animation.And so, then people would vote up and down, and it evolves over time. It's gone through this extraordinary nonlinear trajectory, where it would gain complexity, and then it would collapse and be very simple, over the last 15 years.But you've got the sort of high resolution and narrative version, rather than just this sort of random walk through design space that is represented in his stuff.Anyway, just in case people know Electric Sheep, then that's kind of what this looked like. But it was also sort of ominous, as the thing grows, and you realize it's rising sea levels, and it's like an oncoming train. [laughs]Well, gosh, anyway, Kirell, it's been such a pleasure to talk to you. Where do you want to send people, and do you want to leave them with any parting thoughts?Kirell: First, thank you for having me. It was really a great ... I mean, even the campus here, it's awesome. It's the best research center I've ever seen. So, people, if you don't know here, it's beautiful. The scenery, everything is great. The people here are great. Everyone is great.And so, if you guys are interested in learning more about what I do, I strongly suggest that you visit my website. It's KirellBenzi.com.And also, if you have ideas and collaborations, this is something that I really look for. Like scientists here, anyone that is interested in having this research, and investigate together, if we can make some new art pieces with this, because I'm a scientist, but I don't do much science now. What I do is, I'm the bridge between scientists and the general public here. So, I need also scientists to collaborate with me, to give me part of their research, so we can make new pieces. So, if you guys are interested, I'm all in.Michael: Awesome, thank you so much.Kirell: Thank you very much. Bye bye.
18,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: David Kinney, it's a pleasure to have you on Complexity Podcast.David: It's absolutely great to be here.Michael: This is a very different conversation, or I'm expecting it to be, from the kind of discussions that we've had on the show so far, because you're a philosopher of science.David: Right, yeah.Michael: So this is going to be, I think, for a lot of people, a lot more of a meta-level look at the way that we can start to think about the kind of research that's being done here and the kind philosophical considerations that have to be made in steering research at SFI. It's really cool that you're in the mix here.Let's start with your own personal background and how you got into doing this work, and then how you came to work here. That's two stories, really.David: Great. Yeah. I was born in New York City, Queens, moved up to the suburbs of New York when I was about nine or 10. In undergrad, I was pretty wayward. I took a lot of different classes in the American liberal arts style, where you don't have to settle on a major right away. But I eventually got into philosophy, and specifically philosophy of science, largely as the result of two really good professors, Christine Thomas and Sam Levey. They steered me towards writing this undergrad thesis on the philosophy of probability. When I read it now, it's a little cringe. I think for most people when they read their undergrad work, it can be a bit cringe, but I was super keen. I was super into it.But I wasn't sure if I wanted to have an academic career or anything like that at the time. So I ended up working as a paralegal for two years and then got a scholarship to go do a master's at the London School of Economics. It was there that I really started to get into decision theory and thinking about probability in a less metaphysical way than I had been as an undergrad, and in a more rigorous way, although in my master's it still wasn't very rigorous. Then after one more year out in the private sector, they pulled me back in for good, and I started the PhD there in 2015. That was also at London School of Economics.LSE, listeners might not know, the philosophy department was founded by Karl Popper, obviously, super famous philosopher of science. So it had always been on my radar. And it's a very specialized place where we only really do philosophy that's connected to the rest of the world, whether that's more ethics and political philosophy or decision theory, game theory, formal epistemology, which is more of what I do, which involves sort of the mathematical representation of belief and knowledge and maybe some other epistemic attitudes if there are such attitudes.And then of course philosophy of science. And I ended up writing this thesis about causation and that's sort of more or less my graduate career where SFI comes in is, I was reading actually some computer science papers by a guy called Christof Halupka who's written some really good stuff about coarse-graining and causation. And he's a coauthor with a philosopher named Fredrick Eberhard whose work I also really like.And they cited some stuff by Shalizi and Crutchfield, Cosma Shalizi and James Crutchfield. I went to read that and I saw, where people put their little address under their names and academic articles, Santa Fe Institute. And I kind of heard of the Santa Fe Institute before, but it didn't really have a sense of what it was. And I thought, "Hey, I wonder if they have postdocs?"I saw that they did and I applied because readers, not readers, listeners might not know, but the philosophy job market's really tough. And I applied to about 80 jobs last year.And this was one of two that interviewed me and the one that I got. In that sense, I'm a little different from some people who come here who are sort of steeped in complexity science maybe since their undergrads and have sort of always wanted to come here. For me it was little more accidental, but it was really cool. I got to meet Cosma at an event here recently. Cosma Shalizi. And tell him that, his papers sort of very serendipitously ended up with me coming here. And I've got to say, it's a really great job. So I'm very lucky to be here.Michael: Right on. It sounds like we can just dive directly into the deep end here.David: Okay, great.Michael: And talk about how you understand causality and probability, and how that shapes the kind of work that you're doing, and what kind work you've done in this space. People can go to the show notes and find a link to your website and the links to the papers, at least the published papers we'll be talking about.David: Yeah.Michael: There's one in particular about “Explanatory depth and the pragmatic value of coarse-grained probabilistic causal explanations.” Maybe that's a great place to start. I'll leave that up to you.David: Yeah, that title could have been better, but I don't know how to do it, the title of the paper that is. So in terms of thinking about causality, I'm deeply influenced by an approach to thinking about causation that started in the 80s and has always been a collaborative project between computer scientists, statisticians, people working in the various sciences, and then also philosophers.This is the causal modeling program that really, I mean if you want to look for some names that are really associated with this, Judea Pearl is probably the number one name that listeners might be familiar with. Also very big within the entire Carnegie Mellon philosophy department famously Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines have their whole sort of book, Causation, Prediction, and Search.Without going into too much into the details, it uses a mathematical formalism developed, again by some of these same people. But also in other contexts as well that uses elements from graph theory and probability theory to represent causality. So you basically draw these graphs between random variables, these sort of arrow and blob kind of diagrams, where the blobs are these variables and the arrows are indicating causal relations between those variables. And then you define, a probability distribution over all the ways that these variables in the graph could be, basically saying here's the probability of each possible setting of this system. And your causal graph is only going to be sort of adequate if that probability distribution satisfies certain properties, the most famous of which is the Causal Markov Condition.So what this does is takes this idea causality that had been really sort of bound up in metaphysics and makes it testable. You can look at the data and if your data doesn't fit to a probability distribution that satisfies that Causal Markov Condition, then your graph is going to be inadequate.You mentioned how I'm thinking about what probability is. I mean, to me probability is really a mathematical concept. It has a very standardized mathematical definition, at least classical probability going back to the Russian mathematician, Kolmogorov. and I don't really get into a lot of philosophers spent a lot of time thinking about, objective versus subjective probabilities. That's not something I've really ever published on ever. And for me I'm content with the mathematical definition of what a probability is.Michael: I feel like my job in this conversation is to ask me very naive questions. And the first question, I think you might've actually just answered, and it also touches on your work with Chris Kempes on astrobiology that there's this question that you chew on in there about: probable according to what? And that's I think what you were saying, you kind of don't care about these sort of subjective versus objective probability. Because I've always had this thing about, specifically when we're talking about the likelihood of life, trying to solve the Drake Equation or whatever, that you don't know the denominator. So how are you actually dealing with, maybe not in that particular case, but in understanding, in trying to distill causal relationships, how does profitability in a mathematical formalization get around that kind of issue?David: All right. Well, let me, to be diplomatic to some of my metaphysician friends, I wouldn't say I don't care about what probability is and I don't care about sort of what causality is in this sort of ontological sense. Ontological meaning this sort of the study of being, like what there really is. It's not that I don't care. I mean, I think you'd be crazy not to care in some way. It's just that I haven't worked on it. And I wouldn't be comfortable saying anything really intelligent about those kinds of distinctions. Not that I'd be comfortable with the idea that I'd say anything intelligent about anything, but in my approach, I tend to think about these things more in terms of claims made in probabilistic language or in this sort of language of causal graphs as being conditional to some sort of modeling assumptions, right?So, in probability you usually have a probability space where you have a set of possible outcomes and then a set of subsets of those outcomes that has to satisfy certain conditions and then a probability function that's going to tell you the probability of all those outcomes. That function has to satisfy certain conditions. And then you can say, "Okay, given this mathematical setup, what can we derive? What can we say that's sort of well-supported and logically valid?"And then you can ask questions about, "Okay, well how empirically valid is the setup?" And to me this is a lot of what science does, right? You build a model. And then the model might entail some interesting results. But if that model is a model of nothing, it's only going to be so interesting. But then the models might seem at first glance to be plausible models of some systems.So you mentioned the astrobiology paper, that's not published yet and it might change. But in there we're thinking about some approaches to the ways in which people thought about formalizing inferences about whether planets are hosts of life, exosolar planets. And we note that some of these approaches, specifically what are called Bayesian approaches, make specific assumptions that then can lead to some mathematically kind of funky results that you might want to avoid.And that's the kind of thing too where you can say, "Okay, look, here's what looks like a compelling model." Maybe it's a probabilistic model, maybe it's a graphical model, maybe it's something else that I don't know anything about. But then notice that it entails some weird mathematical consequences. And then maybe that forces you to go back and revise your model even though it seemed empirically adequate or it seemed theoretically well-motivated as Bayesian models in astrobiology can seem. I mean Bayesianism is in a sense a really compelling inductive logic. But it has its limitations. That's sort of what we're pointing out in that work. But that work is still ongoing. I should sort of caveat, it may change and we may find that all of miser mathematical musings are just not worth anything. But we'll figure that out hopefully.Michael: Okay. So, I wanted to go back to, you mentioned the Causal Markov Condition.David: Right.Michael: And this is a really interesting way to formalize thinking on … for me for years, I was thinking about this. And I talked about this a little bit with David Krakauer in the first episode about the difference between complex systems thinking and science driven by machine learning. And how in that space, it's not maybe strictly true, but it's interesting that there is controversy about the theory-less-ness of machine learning results and how these massively dimensional number crunching correlations are not giving us this same kind of truth claims as certain other scientific methodologies. And so I would love for you to discuss a little bit more, like go to a little bit more detail about the Causal Markov Condition.Because I was sitting there listening to your talk about this and I was having trouble deciding whether or not this laid to rest or not my concerns that you never actually know all of the possible hidden variables in a system. And again, it sounds like what you're actually saying is, "Well, we never do. And so the work is always provisional. The model is constantly subject to expansion." But if that's true, then how is this particular setup that you're describing with reasonable degrees of confidence about an acyclic directional graph useful to us in sort of accepting the idea that science can say with any reasonable certainty that something can cause another thing.David: Right.Michael: So that's a mouthful, but…David: Yeah. So just to start off, I mean, in a very sort of non mathematical informal way, what the Causal Markov Condition says is really two things. One, is what's called a screening-off condition. And that means that if A causes B and B causes C and there's nothing else going on, there's just a causal chain, then B is going to give you all the information that you need to know about C. And once you've accounted for B, A doesn't tell you anything else. So it's basically saying, if I cut off a causal chain and say okay I've got all the information at this point, going further back in that chain and looking at the causes of those causes isn't going to give you any new information.The second really contentful thing the Causal Markov Condition says is that where two variables are correlated, they must either be causally related in one direction or another or have a common cause.So, if people with yellow fingers tend to have lung cancer, that's a correlation. Now you think either there's a direct causal relationship there or there's a common cause. In that case it's smoking. Going back to screening off, to stay on these sort of epidemiological examples, if stress causes smoking, and smoking causes lung cancer, really all you need to know about is the smoking. Once you know that, you don't need to go back and say, "Okay, was this person stressed?" when you're trying to sign a probability that they'll get lung cancer.So that's the Causal Markov Condition. In terms of whether we've ever accounted for all the hidden variables, no. There's nothing about assuming the Causal Markov Condition that is going to give you that. And in fact, when Pearl sort of derives the Causal Markov Condition from assumptions, he specifically assumes that there are no sort of unmeasured common causes of two or more variables when he says that any sort of system, any model that ought to be called a causal model has to satisfy this condition.Going to the point about machine learning, I don't know too much about machine learning. And so I'd be hesitant to sort of speak for them. I do know that Pearl is often very critical of the deep learning community basically alleging that they're essentially playing this correlation game and what they're discovering are correlations and not causal structure. There is a very sort of active program within machine learning at doing causal inference from data. And their algorithms explicitly assume the causal Markov condition when building models. I'm thinking in particular sort of pioneering work by people like Heckerman at Microsoft Research and things like that.Michael: Right on. So actually, I feel there're two places we can go from here.David: Yep.Michael: And I'll let you decide which you think is the lowest entropy move conversationally. One is that you brought up the smoking example, and this feels like a good spot that we could get into a little bit more about core screening and explanatory depth and information pricing and how we can start to actually look at different explanations through a lens of their thermodynamic costs.I think that one connects to a lot of the other work that's going on here at SFI about the evolution of cognition in different systems and how evolution and adaptation is actually functioning in conditions of uncertainty. The other one is a little bit more specifically about how you choose the assumptions that you're making. And in your astrobiology, work you make this distinction between Socratic modes of inquiry and Euclidean modes. And I think both of those are really interesting places to jump off. But I'll let you decide where you want to go first.David: Let's do the first paper first. And then maybe we can come back to the Socratic Euclidean stuff. So that paper, which I should say while we're talking, it was my first chapter of my dissertation that I wrote and the one that I spent a ton of time on. And I got a ton of help on it, both in the initial formulation of the ideas and in writing it up and going through the revision process from all of my advisors, but especially my advisor, Katie Steel. Also another advisor is Luke Bovens and Jonathan Birch as well. But definitely Katie from the beginning really had a lot to do with that project. The basic idea there is, I've been talking about these causal models and saying, "Oh, they involve variables," right? Well, variable is just a random variable, is informally just an exhaustive categorization of the different ways that the world could be, right? So classically you think the world could either be such that, Jones is a smoker or Jones is not a smoker, right? Or Jones has lung cancer, Jones doesn't have lung cancer. I threw the ball or I didn't throw the ball, the window shattered or it didn't shatter.Obviously, these kinds of possibilities are what we think about when we think about causation and counterfactuals. Now what that entails is that all of these causal models, are all going to be sensitive to and essentially require us to first specify what these variables actually look like. This is where granularity comes in. The set of values that a variable can take can be more fine grained or coarse-grained, right? So you can say John's a smoker. John is not a smoker. Or you can say John smokes Marlboros, John smokes Camels or he's not a smoker. So on down the list you could list how many cigarettes John has ever smoked, all kinds of things like that.Michael: So just to pop in here, I think this comes up in our conversation in the Facebook group with some regularity. Because one of the things that I feel people try to avoid or just completely rethink is this historical dispute between the scientists that assert that a study of history is a necessary precondition for understanding economics, for example, and the scientists that are willing to look at crowd dynamics through a fluid socio-physics model.And then this is one of these issues where, how much detail, how much contingency you consider relevant. Are you willing to look at somebody as a particle in a fluid in motion or do you need to know why the person made the decision to attend the protest that day?David: Right.Michael: And that these are... If I'm to understand you correctly, these questions have concrete implications for the way that we practice science because it's how much energy do we have, how much time do we have to allocate to a particular line of inquiry? And then also how different allocations ends up giving us, potentially… The interesting thing in this paper for me, among many was that there's an assumption that abstraction and explanatory depth are the same. And you're saying that's not necessarily the case.David: Right. I mean that's... So, as is often the case with academic papers, you have to sort of situate it in this context of sort of debate and things like that. Especially, in philosophy you often have to do this and I think it's mostly to the good. But yeah, so there've been people that said, "Look..." So just to take a step back for a second. The question I'm trying to answer is, there's been a lot of hand-wringing among philosophers that think a lot about these causal models given that they do require you to first set the values of your variables before you can investigate what the causal relations are. There's been a lot of hand wringing about what the right level of granularity is for a given causal model of a given phenomenon. There's been some really... Jim Woodward has a really nice paper in which he sort of goes through all the different sort of possibilities and has a slightly pessimistic conclusion that he can't really think of a good sort of objective reason why any given causal model has to use a particular sort of set of variables or variables with a particular set of values.Some really good work on this by people like Michael Strevens, Laura Franklin Hall, Brad Westlake, all of whom sort of try their hands at one answer or another. Brad Westlake in particular has this answer that you want as coarse-grained as possible, a description of the system that preserves all the causal relationships and preserves all the information between all the variables.But what I show is that in some cases, especially depending on how you're defining information flow that can lead you to some counterintuitive results. What I bring in, in that paper, which is really something that Katie Steele helped me out a lot with, but it was also I guess new within this discussion is a sort of pragmatic bent… I basically say, "Okay, we can actually set up as a decision theory problem, what variable will give us all the information we need and none of the information that we don't for a given decision problem." And then I say, "Look, if you specify some decision problem that you're trying to solve with your causal model, then and the decision problem is going to have a utility function over possible outcomes and a probability distribution between interventions on some causal variable and the values of some variable of interest… You can sort of mathematically say, if you assume certain things about your utility function and how expected utility works, exactly how coarse of a variable can you get away with. And if you assume that coarse graining is good at some level because it reduces the sort of computational complexity or complexity in some other sense of your causal model, then you ought to coarse-grain as much as possible while preserving all of that pragmatic information.So that allows you to coarse-grain up more than you would if you were trying to preserve all the information between variables. But it also gives you a sort of very precisely defined limit. Again, in a given context for how of coarse-grain do you have to go. I think this is coming back to a theme which is that, throughout my work I often find myself saying like philosophers, especially philosophers of science, maybe not, especially philosophers of science. Philosophers in general are often very unsatisfied with answers that require too much context.In this debate for instance, philosophers want to know what is it about the world or what is it about causality in general that can tell you the right level of granularity for your different causal variables. Laura Franklin Hall calls this “the holy grail of philosophy of science” in some settings. What I'm kind of saying is I don't think there is a holy grail in this instance. I think you have to specify the context. In some sense, I think these questions only make sense once you've specified a context, often that's going to be some pragmatic context. You're going to have some problem that you need to solve with these scientific models. So you're going to answer these questions about what's the right level of granularity based on that context.Michael: Yeah. So, this is where thinking about evolutionary dynamics seems to play in where you're actually saying something about the evolution of our own cognitive biases. You give this example about a court hearing. The need for a jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt how fuzzy that is, how a reasonable doubt changes from case to case based on the severity of the crime and the severity of the punishment. So it leads to over n iterations in some evolutionary game, it leads to situations like the one in which human beings are likely to assign agency to a whispering in the grass, as a classic example.Where it's the cost-benefit of getting it wrong and they're not being a tiger in the grass is such that we're actually skewed in the way that we think of banks and it has to do with cost and risk and so on.David: Yeah.Michael: So there's this question of how... I mean, I don't know where you want to take that, but it does sort of raise the question for me of how these biases find their way through this kind of evolutionary game into what we believe is going on in scientific theory.David: Yeah. I mean, I'm not an expert in evolutionary theory and so I'd be cautious about saying anything too definitive on that. I will say that there is a flavor to my work, and I wouldn't characterize it this way in print, but there is a flavor to what I'm doing in that paper in which I'm kind of doing what sometimes is done in moral philosophy in which what's thought to be sort of a kind of deep moral principle is argued to in fact be an artifact of evolution. I don't want to say anything about how successful or unsuccessful those kinds of arguments are in moral philosophy.I will say that some of my work about levels of description has a similar feel, in that I'm saying, sort of, what makes sense for some agent who might be subject to selection pressure. Although I would not have the expertise to formalize what it would mean for that agent to be subject to selection pressures, but given that that agent is going to be subject to some selection pressures, what's the sort of core system model or most sort of adaptively rational model for them to have of the world?And I think in some sense because science is done by agents and group agents and all kinds of agents, all of that's going to matter in terms of how we build our scientific models. I think in some sense that's deeply pragmatist, but I'm happy to sort of own that. I will say David Danks has a sort of much more wide reaching research program and has some really great papers with a student of his, Sarah Wellen, I believe is her name. In which they sort of in a much more broad way than I do, think about the rationality of science and the very enterprise of science from a standpoint of adaptive rationality. So evolutionary rationality, more or less. If anyone's sort of intrigued by these kind of half-formed things I'm saying, now you can go read that and get the fully formed things. [Laughs.] So yeah.Michael: Well, done. This seems we can always double back to the Euclidean and Socratic stuff. I’d love to. But it seems this is a natural place to segue into another unpublished paper, that you're doing with Liam Kofi Bright. On risk aversion and elite group ignorance. You're critiquing the idea that someone in an elite group who is willfully ignorant of the conditions of people outside of that group is irrational. You're making an argument from the perspective of a rational risk aversion. That this is not the case. This really seemed... I don't know. This is just a really interesting piece. So I'd love for you to expose on it a little bit.David: Oh, thanks. Yeah, I should give a big shout out to my co-author Liam there. Liam started as a professor at LSC the final year of my PhD program and we've had a lot of really great talks about this project. I actually introduced him to falafel for the first time over this project. He'd never had a falafel before. We sat in a cafe not far from the London School of Economics and ate falafels and really talked through the details of this paper.But yeah, so our starting point here is a really great paper that I would recommend everyone read by Charles Mills called “White Ignorance” in which he basically takes to task a lot of really great social epistemology being done by people like Hillary Kornblith and people like that. Alvin Goldman. Basically saying that this project of trying to think about belief and knowledge, not as sort of just properties of some one individual, but as attitudes that individuals have in virtue of their participation in society, of their participation in groups and the groups may even have in themselves.Mills is sort of taking all of that to task and saying that it is ignoring this massive role that ignorance plays in the social world, especially ignorance around inequalities in race, in gender, in social class. Mills focuses on race. But he's clear in that paper that he hopes his analysis could be extended to all kinds of social inequalities and the role that all of these inequalities play in our epistemic lives. Right?So this is very much in keeping with what's sometimes called standpoint epistemology, critical race theory, things like that. One thing he says in his paper is that he considers the kinds of ignorance in which, bluntly, white people are ignorant of racism, historical racism, the effects of racism on their lives today. He considers that a form of irrationality. What we do in that paper is acknowledge that Mills is entirely correct if one adopts the standard economic notion of rationality, namely expected utility theory. Mills is entirely correct that any kind of ignorance on the part of any agent would be irrational.But then we show that if you adapt a different way of thinking about decision theory, one built by a philosopher named Lara Buchak who is just moving now actually from Berkeley to Princeton, as far as I'm aware… You can get a result in which it is actually rational to remain ignorant of some information. We set up situations that speak directly to this kind of ignorance of one's privileged status.Just to give you a sort of a flare of how that works, the idea is something like this: Look, if I'm going to borrow my friend's train pass to take the train, let's say that's illegal, right? I'm debating whether or not to do it. I could either just buy a train ticket or take the pass. If I take my friends pass and I'm caught, I'll get a fine. If I don't take their pass I'll obviously have to pay for a ticket. So there's a sort of a built in cost function there and a built in utility function. Because I'd like to not pay any money to take the train.But I'm a little risk averse. So looking at from my risk averse position, I think, “You know what, I could probably get away with taking the pass. Maybe it's 50/50 but it's not worth it. I'm just going to buy a train ticket. Now someone comes in, they can sell me some information. They can tell me whether I'm a member of a group — in this case, white people — that actually have a very low probability of having their train passes subject to any kind of scrutiny. The conductor's just going to walk by, go, “Yeah, train pass. Good. Go right ahead.”Now what we show is that under certain conditions I'll actually pay to avoid being told whether the group that I'm part of is in fact subject to these privileges. The reason why is because it would license all kinds of risk-taking that by my own lights right now I actually want to avoid. I don't want to become this risk-taker in the future.Now this is controversial, right? Whether that's a rational attitude, right? Buchak thinks it is. I think it can be in at least some cases. I think it's fair to say... It's fair to sort of challenge us on that question, is that really rational to say, “Don't give me this information because it'll make me a risk-taker. And from where I'm standing now, I don't want to be risk-taker.”Another example, just to sort of drive the message home a little bit, one that's not related to these sort of socially loaded contexts would be someone who, maybe they're an extreme skier and they've looked at the avalanche report and they think, “Okay, there's maybe a 5% chance of an avalanche. I'm not going to go. I'm not going to go out today. Too risky.” And then someone comes along and says, “Well actually I can tell you whether it's a 10% chance of an avalanche or a 1% chance of an avalanche.” And then the skier says, "Don't tell me, because if you tell me 1% I'm going to go. But from where I'm standing now, I don't want to get involved in an avalanche."So that's the less ethically loaded case. But one that sort of should pump the same intuition. And then we use that in that paper to sort of talk about this broader way of thinking about these issues. Thinking about ways of trying to alleviate these kinds of social hierarchies, right? If we think that these social hierarchies between races, between genders are in themselves sort of deeply problematic features of society, then we say, “Look, it's not going to be enough simply to try and educate people, right? Because here's a model in which people will rationally avoid this information that you're trying to get them.”So you really need to sort of work on these hierarchies more directly. I should say this is very much a how possibly model as in this standard economics tradition of saying, “Look, here's some math that kind of shows you how things could go.” We acknowledge in that paper that there needs to be a lot more work in cognitive science before this could go from a how-possibly model to a how-actually model.But this is work in progress. It might change. It's sort of running the gauntlet of the journals right now. But one thing I'm really proud of in that paper is the way in which we sort of bring mathematical philosophy to bear on questions that it is traditionally avoided. Right? There's sort of... I think it's partly sociological, anthropological, but there's been a divide until very recently between philosophers that use a lot of math in their work and philosophers that think deeply about social inequalities and other real world issues.I think that's to the detriment of both of those kinds of philosophers to some extent. I don't want to say everyone has to do mathematical philosophy or everyone has to do politically loaded philosophy because they don't. But I'm quite proud that I have something that hopefully will someday see the light of day in which we're bridging that divide a little bit.Michael: For me, one of the most interesting things about this paper, you squeeze in right at the very end, where you're talking about what precipitates out of this in terms of there being a prima fascie plausible line of argument that the correct thing to do is just to devote our efforts to trying to inform people who are risk-averse and rationally avoiding information to make an effort. And I hate to even bring this up, but I see a lot of people throwing themselves against the wall in sort of #okboomer-style conversations where people in a group that feels that they are economically disadvantaged is trying to make the case that things are actually worse out there than you realize. What you're saying is that this suggests that, at least under a certain set of constraints on this situation, you may encounter so much resistance that the energy could be better spent on direct interventions with the disadvantaged than on trying to appeal to the privileged group.David: Yeah. Direct interventions on society, right? Making society such that there is not a deep material disadvantage associated with being a particular race or a particular gender as a result of deeply unfair and historically ingrained practices. Yeah, the kind of “Education is not enough” idea. I think this is something that's treated much more interestingly in the Mills paper itself. This is the Charles Mills paper, “White Ignorance.” Because in that paper he goes through all of these historical examples to illustrate the extent to which privileged people, a group in which I entirely count myself, privileged people are really motivated not to have to acknowledge their own privilege.There are all kinds of reasons why you wouldn't want to do it, which is why it's interesting in a way that the sort of thing we critique Mills for calling this a kind of irrationality. He calls it motivated irrationalities, as there's deep motivation to be ignorant of these things, that the ignorance is inherently irrational, but there's still a motivation behind it. We come in and say, no, let's try and fit this to a model of rationality. But Mills is very right to point out the lengths people will go to to avoid information that is uncomfortable to them. And to act upon that information would require them to make changes in their life that would make the world more fair but might make their lives a little bit less comfortable in a number of ways.Yeah, I think this is really going against a traditional notion in both epistemology and in economics that people will always seek information, right? Because that would be the rational thing to do on some model. But we show that if you have a broader definition of rationality that includes other ways of mathematizing what one counts as a choice or the action, you can see that in fact it is entirely in keeping with rationality for people to maintain a kind of ignorance that we might nevertheless find morally, deeply objectionable.Michael: So to again draw a totally slipshod and potentially faulty analogy here to evolutionary thinking, this seems like what we're saying is that in our pursuit of the quote unquote truth that we reached these local optima, and that there may be a higher peak over here, but to get there from here requires you cross the valley, which rationally nobody is going to do, right? I mean that's keeping with Kuhnian idea of scientific paradigm shifts that you elsewhere critique.David: I guess I would say in the context of the particular paper we've just been talking about, I think we would not want to claim there were at any kind of local or global social optimum, and we're basically showing, well, one way not to get to something closer to a social optimum is just through education because t here are these rational impulses towards avoiding information, at least from the self interested rationality of individual agents.More to the point, I think that things would just be, at least in the short term... But maybe this is where your point comes in. I see what you're saying now. Yeah. There might be a long-term benefit to receiving information that you, by your own risk averse lights, judged to be information that you ought to avoid. And this gets into really good work on dynamic choice including in a risk averse context. People like Johana Toma and Jonathan Weisberg working on dynamic choice under risk averse cases, where you're not just looking at one decision problem but potentially hundreds or thousands of decision problems, and how risk aversion factors into that kind thing. And there, I do think there's a case we made that information that might be harmful to you in the short term is nevertheless beneficial to you in the longterm. Getting people to make those kinds of decisions with a longer time horizon could in itself be a very worthwhile project.Michael: Well, you're not going to have to fight me to agree on that.David: Okay. Good.Michael: In fact, that section reminds me of the work that SFI external professor Ole Peters is doing on ergodicity economics, and disabusing ourselves of the notion that people actually make decisions across the space of possible outcomes. They're actually looking at a situation iterated over a given time horizon, like you said.David: Yeah. Without knowing too much about Ole's work, there is a direct relevance here in that both of us are looking at the consequences in a broad way of jettisoning this one picture of rationality that involves expected utility theory where expectations are a weighted linear average over possibilities. He's jettisoning that in his own way. We're doing it a slightly different way here. But both of us are sort of exploring notions of a broader context of rationality. Yeah.Michael: I want to make sure you get out reasonably close to your fair time. But before we go, I feel like I've already promised this so many times: I just want to hairpin here and double back on this interesting distinction that you make in the astrobiological work on Socratic versus Euclidean modes of inquiry. How that kind of thinking constrains the kinds of questions that we feel fair to ask in science.David: Yep. Good. Basically, this comes out of a book review in which Clark Glymour, really famous philosopher of science, someone whose work has been influential on mine in a number of ways, including my work on the problem of old evidence. He came up with the problem of old evidence. I'm glad we haven't talked about the problem of old evidence today because it's very boring, but that's another area that I work on where he's been influential. But he, in this review of a really great book by Jim Woodward, as well as just in some interviews that he's done, has made this distinction between Socratic and Euclidean modes of inquiry.And the way that Socratic mode of inquiry does is you try and define all your concepts, give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the thing that you're trying to study, right? So the Socratic approach to morality would be to say, okay, what is the necessary and sufficient conditions for an action to be good, right? The Socratic approach to epistemology — this has generated a ton of ink — is the question of what are the necessary and sufficient conditions to know something, right? These Socratic analyses of concepts. Most philosophy has gone this way, right?And then there's this Euclidean mode, in which you don't try and do that. Rather what you do is you state some axioms that you take to be warranted, right? And this is where you get back to people like Wittgenstein and Reichenbach in terms of this idea that assumptions can be warranted even if they're not known or even if you don't have reasons to believe them necessarily, or sorry, you might have reasons to believe them, but they might not be empirically grounded reasons or things like that. But you put forward these assumptions, then you investigate the consequences of those assumptions. And given that the assumptions are meant to encode something about how you think the world is, you can get results out of that that constitutes new knowledge. You can have a fruitful inquiry, right?And it's called Euclidean because the idea goes, Euclid has this whole geometry in which he has a set of axioms. And from there he's able to derive all these incredibly rich geometric concepts. But he never defines some of the primitive terms in these axioms. The example Glymour gives is the point, right? Euclid doesn't spend any time talking about what it is necessary and sufficient for, for something to be a point. He just uses this notion of a point in these axioms, and it's in investigating those axioms that you start to really get a sense of what a point is because you understand the role it plays in some system.I think if you look at the history of Socratic projects, they're usually carried out in philosophy. Philosophy is a discipline where there's an active debate over whether it makes progress. I think philosophy does make progress in a lot of ways, but certainly the sciences which tend to take a more Euclidean approach, I think there could be no doubt the sciences have made progress. Although Kuhn would disagree with me there. But I certainly think there could be no doubt that the sciences have made progress. This does speak to this Euclidean way of doing things. I mean, you can just spend all your life trying to find out the necessary sufficient conditions of one thing, or you can just make an assumption and see if it leads to fruitful further consequences.And just to tie things full circle, this is exactly what the causal modeling approach based on the Causal Markov Condition does with this notion of cause. At no point in this literature do you ever get something that says, “ X causes Y, if and only if,” and some long list of things. The closest that you come really is Jim Woodward's book on causal explanation in which he uses this causal modeling formalism to try and derive conditions like that. But cause in this framework plays the same role that point does in Euclidean geometry. And then just by setting up these axioms you get this really fruitful, rich understanding of what a cause is. You could derive all sorts of theorems and ask all kinds of interesting questions as I'm trying in my own feeble way to do in a lot of my work. Ask all these kinds of interesting questions about how causality works using these axioms. It's there that you're able to make progress, I think.As far as my meta-philosophy goes, I'm a big fan of Euclidean approaches in philosophy. I think there are coming to be more and more of them. And I think working with scientists like I do at SFI is a good way of continuing that project because scientists, to me anyway, seem to be in the business of launching Euclidean projects. And so yeah, just seeing, watching people do that all the time really gives me inspiration and really helps direct my inquiry throughout all my work.Michael: Just to tie a hypothetical bow on this, it sounds to me what you're saying, or what I see rather, through all of your work, is an appreciation for submission to the humility that what we know is within a given time horizon, given the available energy, based on the level of aversion to risk that we have inherited. Within a particular margin of error, given reasonably defined bounds of profitability. I think a lot of people think about not just philosophy but also science as seeking much more grandiose and final statements about the world. And it seems as though really the message elaborated on in your work so much is, again like you said earlier, much more about the conditional and the contextual in all of this thinking.David: I think that's really well put. I think I maybe paradoxically take it as a great compliment if you think there's a sense of humility that comes through in my work. You mentioned how people think about philosophy and how people think about science, and I think it is part of a PR problem that both of those fields... Maybe not a PR problem, maybe it's just a PR reality. If you go to the website of a philosophy department in the anglophone world, certainly you'll be told to take philosophy classes because it'll help you understand the big questions.Similarly, the sciences sell themselves on this idea that if you study the sciences you will gain more understanding. And in a sense, both of those things are true, but I think there's a tipping point at which in both the sciences and philosophy, you realize exactly, as you said, how much of our knowledge is scaffolded, just how much of our knowledge is context dependent. And yeah, I think that's one of the really profound things you get out about this. I don't know if there's a way to sell that to people. I don't know if you could say study biology so you can know how little we know about life. Study philosophy so you can know how little we know about everything.Michael: There are rational reasons to remain ignorant.David: There might be rational reasons to be remaining ignorant there, at least if you're trying to get anyone to take your classes. And just one more point on that. I've mentioned a lot of names of mostly contemporarily working academic philosophers. It's not to give an impression of being well-networked because I'm not really. I don't know most of these people that I'm mentioning. And it's also not to give a sense of how well read I am because I'm not well read.It's more to give a sense of we're all just doing these little research projects that together form a really nice mosaic. And I think if there's one thing I could get across about how philosophy is versus how it's seen, it's often seen as this discipline where you have big names. Kant, Hume, Mill, Aristotle. But today I think it's practiced much more communally and in a much more piecemeal way, closer to the way the natural sciences have been for a long time. And I just hope that collaborative and piecemeal trend continues.Michael: Awesome. David, thanks for sticking around a few extra minutes and rapping with us.David: Alright. No problem, Michael. Thank you very much.
19,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Awesome. Albert Kao, It's a pleasure to join you here amidst the complexity.Albert: Hello. Yeah, thanks for having me.Michael: I'd to start these conversations by inviting you to talk a little bit about how you became a scientist in the first place, how you became interested in what you're researching, and what led you to the Santa Fe Institute.Albert: Yeah, I don't know if I'm out of the ordinary here at SFI, but I feel like compared to the average scientist, I've had a pretty loopy trajectory to get to where I am today. I think I first started getting interested in physics in middle school. For some reason, I thought I was supposed to be a medical doctor. I thought that was a family expectation. Then I learned about the structure of the atom in seventh grade and then came home to my parents and was like, "I think I want to be a physicist. Is it okay if I'm not a doctor?" They were like, "We never said you had to be one." Yeah.Then in college I majored in physics and then got interested in biophysics and biology, started grad school in a biophysics program and did some rotations in biomechanics labs, neuroscience labs, and then came to the realization or at least the belief, that neuroscience was too difficult, what I really like along with decades off from a full understanding of a brain. Then I learned about animal groups, and how the structure and the function of animal groups in a lot of ways mimics the structure and function of brains.Obviously, there's a lot of differences as well. It seemed like a more tractable system to study decision-making in collective systems. You can control the group size, you can interrogate it and perturb in different ways that I thought was not feasible at the time in neural systems. And yeah. I did my PhD studying animal groups, and then learned that they're not that easy to study either.Michael: Yeah. I think we'll probably keep coming back and back to this as we do as a meta on the show in general, which is that, a lot of these things, they may be easier to study in one system or one scale, but then you end up taking this circuitous path through disciplines and realizing that you're studying something very similar to what you thought was very different once upon a time.Albert: Yeah. I think my academic path has been very torturous, but also, I think, I get a lot of insights. I'm glad I know something about neuroscience. I'm glad I know something about physics. And applying all that seemingly random knowledge to study different animal groups has been super useful.Michael: Right on. I'd like to start as broadly as we possibly can, because your work takes a lot of different angles to this issue of animal sociality. It is an interesting question that you raise in your work about why organisms would end up channeled down the path of least resistance into evolutionary adaptation for sociality. Frankly, as long as I've been thinking about this, I was embarrassed to realize that I had been naive about there maybe only one reason why animals would choose a social organization. Your research suggests that there are multiple reasons for this, and I'd love to hear you talk a little bit more about that.Albert: Yeah. I and other postdocs here at SFI and also postdocs on the James McDonnell Foundation Fellowship, have been working on this project to look super broadly across the tree of life, from bacteria, to insects, to birds, to mammals, and look at the literature and see, what are all the different ways being social can benefit an organism? There's so many different ways, just dozens, probably hundreds of hypothetical ways in which being social can help you. Raising offspring, raising together, you can provide more food for them, or defend against predators, or you can huddle and keep warm together. You can sometimes decrease the risk of disease by picking fleas off each other, but oftentimes you can also increase risk of disease.A lot of these benefits have to do with getting resources. Whether it's locating prey, or capturing prey, maybe as a group, you can capture larger prey items than you could alone. Maybe you want to catch prey, you can defend the prey against other animals who might steal it from you. We documented just dozens and dozens of these different benefits. Then one thing that I thought was cool about this project is that we categorized them into fundamentally different kinds of benefits. In terms of getting resources, we found that there's basically six kinds of ways in which sociality can be beneficial. There's also lots of ways and specifically in different contexts, where that benefit can play out and manifest itself. Fundamentally, we found there's only six different ways in which being social can help you get resources.Michael: Correct me if I'm wrong about this, but it seems like you can loosely say that it's about metabolic, like you said, resource acquisition or energy saving, huddling for warmth, or that there is a decision-making benefit and those collective computation, right, broadly. Those two things seem like, in a way really intimately related. That's one of the things again, that seems like an overarching theme about a lot of the work that's being done here, which is, how do we articulate and unify a physics of information and a physics of thermodynamics? Maybe I'm getting ahead of the conversation here, but specifically, when we're talking about collective biological computation, what do we mean?Albert: I guess I alluded to it a few minutes ago about the mapping potentially, between neural systems and animal groups. That's the bulk of the research that I've done so far is thinking about, what unique computational abilities does being social get you for free, basically? And is it easier to evolve social interactions compared to evolving a larger brain, for example, or better individual sensory organs like eyes or ears? Can you just combine a bunch of ears together, like crappy ears, and then have a lot better power compared to evolving a more precise ear?Approximately, you can apply that in a lot of different cases, so you can get food better if you're searching together and looking for prey together, you can detect and run away from predators better, but also things like migration, detecting the north or south, or following landmarks and things like that.A lot of models assume that individuals are guessing independently of each other. We know in real life, a lot of estimates aren't independent. We all read a small number of newspapers or listen to small number of radio shows and so our opinions about certain topics are not generally independent, but they're correlated because we read the same stuff. I asked, what effect does that have on collective decision making? One pretty robust result that I got was that, this leads to some optimal group size for decision-making, that in contrast to the basic assumption that decision accuracy increases monotonically with group size, so it just increases more and more as groups get larger…in fact, in these environments, where you have correlations, you get some optimal group size, like 10 or 15 is best. And larger groups do worse and smaller groups do worse.Michael: This is related to the conversation I had with Mirta Galesic on the show where, she was looking at related research on an optimal group size for decision-making. The thing that I like about both of your research and her research, you mentioned it actually in the in this Quanta Magazine article, where you're commenting on another research paper about collective decision-making. You say, “It feels like what you're doing is a second wave of research. The first wave was naive enthusiasm for collective systems. It's like, there has been a surge, even recently in the last few years, of interest and evangelizing about the wisdom of crowds. I think you're right to point out this particular nuance, which is that we ourselves are social creatures and working online in social media, it's clear that certain people's voices have disproportionate impact and that adding more people who just agree with someone due to charisma or whatever, isn't actually making the collective any smarter.It was easy to read this paper, “Decision accuracy in complex environments is often maximized by small group sizes,” that you did with Iain Couzin. Like you said, to see in it a clear analogy to the way that our media landscape has changed over the last few decades, the way that we're no longer unanimously correlated in that everyone's reading the same newspaper. But now we have an opposite problem, which is that there are too many contradicting news sources. I'm curious how you understand the problems of communication at scale in modern society, in light of your research, whether there's any insights into how, given the media landscape that we have, should we be making more of an effort to be reading the same thing, or should we be making an effort to change the size of the groups in which we are making decisions based on the fragmentation of information?Albert: Yeah, it's a dual problem as well, not to make it worse. Like you said, there's the media landscape, so how many different news sources are we paying attention to? What is the influence of the most powerful ones? Secondly, also the fact that with social media, we talk to each other a lot more, so this is not my work, but a follow-up work by other researchers, found a similar phenomenon that I did, but here correlations came about because of social influence. Individually, this model could look at the decisions of its previous group mates, and then make its own decision based on its own information, but also by looking at these previous decisions.They found a similar thing where you get an optimal group size. And we think there's a strong mapping between my paper and their paper where there's something to do with correlations being generated, not by an external force here, but by social interactions. This global social media landscape ties these two papers together, where people are talking to each other a lot more, but also, maybe the topics of conversation are being dominated by a small number of influential people or news organizations.So what to do about that? It's a challenge being a theorist to try to map these simple abstract models to the real world, whether it's animals or humans, because ideally, that's what we want to do. We want to say something useful about the world and try to make the world a better place. At the same time, I think we have to be careful about how we interpret these models. They are very simple. Again, what features are we missing that we need to add in order to be more confident in the recommendations we make to policy makers or to the public or to companies? Like I've said, previously, with work they've already done, adding some of these features can really change the predictions of your models. So we have to be careful and make sure that we're incorporating all of the really important features and leaving out less important ones.Michael: So we are also talking not just about the paper I just mentioned, but we're also referencing this other paper that you wrote here. You were the lead author on a paper “Counteracting estimation bias and social influence to improve the wisdom of crowds.” Some of what you said is coming straight out of this paper. One of the things that I found interesting is that your team played a trick in this particular study,  where what you were telling people with social information about other people's estimates, and seeing if it would change their decisions, their estimates, and that, over a third of the participants completely discounted social information. 231 out of 602 participants were immune to this hack. This might be a tangent, but I'm curious why you think some people were waiting social information more greatly than other people and why some people don't consider it at all.Albert: We don't have direct data on why those people decided to ignore social information, so this is all speculation. It could be that there's a certain fraction of the population that are just generally immune, regardless of context. It could also be the case where in this particular estimation task, which was a simple jelly bean jar estimation task, which we got a lot of mileage off of. We did some experiments here at SFI. You'd be surprised at how poorly some people guessed despite knowing all the theory about packing fractions and spherical objects and things like that. Anyway. Yeah, so they could have been really confident on this specific task, and therefore, because they were confident, they discounted social information. There's other papers in our literature showing that confidence can correlate with social influence or propensity to be influenced by social information.There's a separate question of whether confidence correlates with actual ability. We know the whole Dunning-Kruger work that maybe not or maybe even a negative correlation. Anecdotally we interviewed a couple people from this experiment and asked them why they guessed the way they guessed. Some people were very poor guessers, but very confident. If I could just quickly tell two anecdotes…Michael: Please.Albert: There was roughly like 600 jelly beans in this jar. Guesses ranged from 80 to 10,000, so a super wide range of guesses. We interviewed one of the guys who guessed really low, like 80 something. He was an undergrad at Princeton. He's an undergrad Princeton who's majoring either in physics or engineering. He did all his calculations and came up with, 85 or something, and the actual number was like 600 like wealth. Another dude guessed 10,000 and so we asked him why. He was a jelly bean delivery man. He's like, "I do this for a living. I know. I look at that jelly bean, I know the size. It's for sure 10,000 on that order." I was like, "Okay, you're off by one and a half orders magnitude, but.Yeah. In this task, it was a pretty, seemingly easy task, but then very hard for humans to do. We had a super wide range of guesses. In classic wisdom of crowds fashion, we found that the average of those guesses was pretty close to the true answer.Michael: This paper gets a little bit more into how you can correct for those kinds of intense biases that you're talking about. One of the figures talks about there being a relation between the probability that an individual is   affected by social information and their displacement in the society. This is interesting because this kind of segues, I would say the question lurking behind this whole conversation for me is, when are larger and smaller groups adaptable? In what settings are groups of different sizes the best decision for the complexity of a particular problem given a society of a particular structure?Like you said, it's a simple jelly bean counting exercise. But the question about social influence seems to be related to your other work you're talking about on correlation of sensory inputs, which is related to this other paper you wrote with Iain Couzin on modularity and how groups can naturally start forming modular subgroups in order to improve their decision making ability. So I'm curious… What a messy question. To add another fold to this, when we're talking about groups, we're talking about groups that are not homogeneous. They have a structure. People are in different locations within that group. They're not just seeing different things outside of the group. They're having different informational relationships within the group.Possibly, the actual question I'm asking is for you to talk a little bit about this paper on modularity, and why you found this counterintuitive result, which is that sometimes, if you break a group up, you end up with a better decision at the level of, when everyone comes back together to compare notes.Albert: Yeah. That paper, instead of looking at one group, say making decisions by majority rule, it was structured so that they exist in subgroups. Subgroups make decisions, say by majority rule, and then the decisions of the subgroups get combined, and so on and so forth. You can have as many tiers as you want in this hierarchy until you get one consensus decision. We studied that, because there's some evidence in the literature that a lot of animal groups exist in some sort of modular structure like that, whether it's something as simple as fish schools…if you track the motion of each fish in a school, you find that subgroups of fish stayed together longer than you expected. They were just randomly mixing, up to actual hierarchies like primate societies or elephants that live in family groups, but then the family groups are connected over large spatial scales to each other.The first thing that we found there was that these modular structures always result in a loss of information. We think the general idea is that, the wisdom of crowds works because that group has more information than each individual and having more information is better and so they make a better decision. We found that modular structure always leads to a loss of information and so you would guess that that would be bad for collective wisdom, and in some cases, it is true. But in the correlation context, we found the opposite was true, that having the structure could actually improve. It still leads to information loss, but paradoxically, it can lead to gains in decision accuracy.This ties into the whole optimal group size result that we talked about earlier because what modular structure does is, it allows groups to behave as if they were a smaller group because of this loss of information. A group of 1000 with some sort of modular structure has effectively the information of, say a group of size 60, or something. If you have an optimal group size that's smaller than your actual group size, then what we think is that one strategy groups could use in order to make better decisions is to behave as if they were smaller by creating this modular structure. We think that, especially for animal groups, this could be really useful and interesting, because like we said, at the start of this talk, that there's tons of reasons why being social can benefit you.For certain benefits, it might be better to be in a large group, for example, defending against predators. Then for other benefits, might be better to be in a small group, like decision-making. Having this modular structure gets you the best of both worlds. We can actually be a big group and defend against predators, but then in a decision-making context you behave as if you're a smaller group. It just seems like a really interesting way in which animals and groups can tune what we call the effective group size for different contexts.Michael: This seems somewhat related to research you mentioned elsewhere, that there's a negative correlation between the size of an ant colony and the size of the individual ant brains. I remember David Krakauer talking at UBS for an ACtioN Network meeting earlier last year, where he was saying something similar about, the more we embed ourselves in this information technology milieu, the more we outboard cognitive resources and relying on these collective computations. There's a pretty common expectation that, we're getting dumber as individuals, as the collective of humanity is getting smarter.Albert: Yeah. We just Google everything instead of remembering things.Michael: The Quanta article that you were commenting on comes up a lot, in conversations in the Facebook group and elsewhere about a similar thing where, if the memory of nodes in a network is too long, then the network loses adaptability. It becomes dumber. There are all of these different ways that it seems as though the networks within individuals are shaped and in some sense constrained by the selection pressure on the networks of individuals. This is Jessica Flack's work on coarse-graining as downward causation. It seems like what you're talking about, that the modular structure allows the collective social organism to coarse-grain the information that it's getting and make a better judgment. What do you think of all this?Albert: Yeah. I don't know. I think we don't know very much about the relationship between individual cognition and collective cognition. I think as, say, physicist studying collective behavior, there's a natural tendency, aesthetically, to ask the question, how dumb can the individual components be, to still have this interesting collective ability? Aesthetically, that's something that people in my field like to show. It's like, "Oh, you can have this awesome collective ability and look, the individuals can be so dumb and still have it." Right. It's interesting, you get so much at the collective level.But I think that's not the right question to ask. I think the question should be, “What is the relationship between individual cognition and collective cognition?” Why should you have dumb components when you're in a group or can you have smart components, and even smarter collective abilities? Is there some trade off between the two, where maybe there's an energetic trade off where by offloading computation from individual brains and doing it collectively through social interactions, are you saving metabolic energy or something like that? Or is there some computational bottleneck if you have individual components that are too smart?I was talking to a visitor here a few months ago and he actually brought up that observation from the literature showing that in a certain subgroup of ants, the larger the colony, the smaller the brain size of the individual ants. We were brainstorming is there a fundamental reason why that might be the case? I think it's its wide open. I think we know very little about it. I think it's a really cool area for future research, but also, I think it's another to hearken back to an earlier point, why I want to be cautious when applying some of these results to humans, which are, we think, quite smart, most of the time, sometimes.They're not just simple automata making decisions through majority rule. They can have conversations with each other. They can influence each other. There's all these sorts of subtle signals that you send to each other. People like Mirta who are more sociologists or others who are psychologists, I think linking that understanding of the human brain to these theoretical models of collective decision making, and to animal groups can be a really interesting intersection of these Venn diagrams of related but different areas of research.Michael: I think now seems like a good time to ask the question we've been dancing around this whole time, which is, all of these different research vectors... I feel like you must have developed by now an intuition for the evolutionary context within which you're going to see large groups form that are benefiting from the wisdom of crowds and the kinds of decisions that the group has to make for that to be the way to go, and then when those large groups might want to specialize into some sort of hierarchical structures, so that there's differences in influence…when a group might want to correlate itself very strongly over a small geographic area, when it makes more sense to spread out. When our crowds wise? When are they dumb? These deeper questions that are alluded to by all of your research.If you were to create a handbook to this kind of a thing, I know you've already made it clear you're very careful about policy advisement, but Aeon Magazine article by a bunch of SFI people, Doyne Farmer, Beinhocker, Rasmussen and non-SFI author Fontina Markopoulou just wrote this great piece on the lag between our physical technologies and our social technologies. Most of the people I know that are smart, young folks working in technology, are deeply concerned about how can we better organize ourselves? How can we organize ourselves more smartly, to handle the complexity of the problems that we're facing? That's the motivation for this kind of a question.Albert: Yeah. I've been prefacing everything with like, I don't want to go on record making very specific recommendations. However, I do think it's super important. A friend of mine and collaborator, just got a bunch of people, including me, together to write this perspectives piece on this where he calls collective behavior a “crisis discipline.”I believe it was coined for conservation biology. It's the same thing where, for conservation biology is like, we don't have a full understanding of ecological systems, yet these habitats are being destroyed super rapidly and so we need to make some decision about what to do, even with imperfect information. This perspectives piece is making the same argument, but for collective behavior, where so many people are online for so much of the day on Twitter, Facebook, whatever…and this is having meaningful impacts on political systems like public discourse, all these things. But at the same time we have a poor understanding of collective behavior. The state space is so large. Right? There's different size of groups, there's different network structures, there's different decision contexts, there's all sorts of variables that we need to play around with, ideally, in experiments.And yet, we can't wait another 10 years or 20 years before we start to make recommendations. And so this piece, I think, is really interesting and important, because it makes me feel so uncomfortable. Okay, say in the next two years, what kind of experiments should we do? What kind of modeling should we do now in the next two years, in order to say something concrete about how to regulate these companies? Or how should governments counteract bad actors on these networks or other governments? Even if we're not completely confident of what we know, we still have to say something and not saying anything at all, is also a decision. Despite and because of my reluctance, we wrote this piece, and I think it's really important, it's really urgent as we know from every news cycle.Michael: Just to anchor this a little bit, in the discussion on your paper on modularity you and Couzin say, “Silencing the minority opinion within subgroups modularity necessarily causes a loss of information. In general modular structure is detrimental to collective decision accuracy in simple environments.” I was thinking about this in terms of the conversation I had with Andy Dobson recently, and island biogeography, and how it seems like, if we want to take this another way, maybe a more comfortable analogy in the biological rather than the social, it seems like genetic drift is helping to accomplish something similar in population biogeography. That when you have a large population on land, through the grace of genetic drift alone, a lot of these edge opinions, if you will, mutations that don't necessarily have a benefit or a detriment, are lost in the wash. Whereas on a smaller Island, you get a different kind of decision-making.I'm curious how you think that this work on decision-making might shed more light onto processes that are not intentional or decisive in the way that we would understand them, how cognition might be recognized or understood at the level of ecological networks, rather than individual organisms working in association with one another?Albert: Yeah. If I understand your question correctly, the thing that links those islands together and the social systems together, especially the modular ones, is diversity. Right? In islands, since they're isolated from each other, you get diversity of genetic material that can then be more fit than other variants. Similarly, with the social systems, what's really important is diversity of opinion. If you have some very influential person, even if that person is very smart, you miss out on that collective wisdom that you get just from diversity of opinion. A lot of that is noise. Each individual person could be very noisy and very inaccurate, but then there's some process which we're still trying to understand in which the average can be quite good. Creating modular structures can permit in a similar way to islands, isolation from other opinions and you can breed different opinions with any subgroup, which many of them might be bad, but then the average of them or some combination of them can be quite good.Michael: I might be stretching this to the breaking point, but it seems almost as though... If you think about evolution as a cognitive process, then the diversity of biological computation is a reflection of or an epiphenomenon of the geographic and environmental diversity. So there's almost a conservation argument here that's similar to the argument made about ethnobotanical conservation, that we don't know what we're losing, by homogenizing habitats, because then we're ultimately homogenizing the cognitive strategies available to us moving forward.Albert: Yeah. There's pros and cons, obviously, to things like social media, where you permit the formation of really niche groups. Where, say, like globally, there might only be a handful of people or 100 people or whatever, who have some niche interest. If they were to seek each other out, geographically, it'd be impossible, but on the internet, you can find each other make a subreddit, now you're connected. That can be good and bad, right, depending on what those people are interested in.So yeah. I think some of the conversation in the media focuses on the negative of Nazis can find each other more easily and communicate online and things like that, so how do we find them? How do we discourage those kinds of groups from forming?Also, it can be positive, which is by breeding diversity of thought and diversity of opinion. You just get more raw material to work. Humanity gets more broad material to work with. And perhaps in some sense, that's not the worst thing. Once in a while, we might generate some awesome idea from it and make some forward progress, but then also we need to filter out some of the neutral or even actively harmful elements as well. It's a balance between taking a really forceful top-down approach to regulating things on the internet, but also permitting a diversity of opinions is still bubbled up from the bottom-up.Michael: Yeah. When I think about this stuff, I think about it in terms of the cost of innovation. This is this may be out of place, but there's that theological argument that it's like you can't have choice without evil. Right? It's a very similar kind of scientific formulation or same thing, that's like, if we want to encourage creative solutions, then there is a certain amount of accepting the fact that those structures also empower individuals to raise the bar on existential risk of civilization, et cetera.Albert: Yeah, I don't know. I think one way into the question is like, can you differentiate between say, good things and bad things on the internet in some ways so that you can control one, but also allow the other to persist? I think there is some evidence about that. There was a paper that came out a couple years ago showing that false news spreads on Twitter differently than true news. It's it spreads faster and penetrates more deeply into the social network. So there might be signatures. There might be signatures of good things and bad things. Then by detecting, by classifying those two, maybe we could identify and target false news and, allow true news too. I don't know. It's very speculative, but there might be something there as a strategy.Michael: Interesting. Actually, you're reminding me of work currently unpublished by Josh Garland and Mirta Galesic on the network structures of conversations on Twitter. They were talking about how somebody who has an inflammatory post that just generates responses to the original post rather than a debate that branches, it's got a higher fractal dimension. There's more branches because people are taking the time to respond to things in sub-points and sub-sub-points.That work suggests that we can actually take an orbital view on different conversations and identify whether they're worth getting involved in, by… Like you talked about elsewhere in your work, we were talking about earlier, when everything is correlated to that original comment versus when everybody is coming at it from a different angle and looking at a different piece of it and that, in a way, it's almost, I might be over stretching it here, but I look at Garland and Galesic work on that stuff and I see that there might be a way for us to talk about good things and bad things online in terms of whether they actually facilitate collective decision-making in an effective way, or whether they are actively draining our mental resources and creating these self-replicating viral structures that just absorb our brains.Albert: Yeah. I guess, a thing to add on to what we're talking about with modular structure permitting diversity of opinion, and maybe that could be good, is that, I guess that corollary to that is that you also need them to talk to each other, eventually. These different modules, now that you’ve generalized it for diversity, they need to talk to each other and then create your improved solution. Perhaps the counter argument is that, in our current state, that's not happening. Right? Factions are becoming more and more polarized and there's no sign of that reversing in trend and so maybe that's the missing piece where like, yes, these factions might serve some purpose, but only if, at some point in the future, you come back to the table and talk and make decisions together. That seems to be what's missing currently, in the state of play, either on the internet or in politics.Michael: This seems the perfect place to bring up the last paper I wanted to talk with you about that you just published, the pre-print on “The wisdom of stalemates.” Obviously, most people find a stalemate immensely frustrating, but it sounds like you've got an argument here that, viewed from the level of the social organism, a stalemate, it actually has evolutionary value. That there are good reasons for us to get to these points. Could you unpack that a little?Albert: Yeah. In most models, and the models we've talked about in this conversation, it usually plays out like this. You have some decision scenario, individuals get information, maybe they talk to each other; at the end of the day, the group has to make some sort of collective decision. We asked the question, What if they don't have to? What if there's a third option? Usually, these are binary scenarios where you have option A, option B, you have to choose one. We asked, what if there's a third scenario in which you can have a stalemate and just have no decision? What effect does that have?And so we analyzed the scenarios that we've talked about already, simple environments in which the wisdom of crowds comes about and then more complicated scenarios like the ones with correlations and things like that. We found that stalemates can be almost always good for collective accuracy, because you reach a stalemate more often in cases where, if you were forced to make a collective decision, you would have made a bad one, the incorrect one. And so stalemates can save you from making a bad decision and put off the decision to another day in which you're more likely to make a better decision.The value of stalemates obviously depends on the cost of a stalemate compared to the cost or benefit of option A versus option B. If stalemates are super costly, then you don't want to use that strategy. For example, if you're a school of fish, and a shark is coming at you full speed, and you're trying to decide what is the best direction to run away in, it doesn't matter. Right? Whatever direction is better than the shark direction, and so it doesn't matter what it is.Michael: Into the net.Albert: Yeah. Stalemates are the worst, pick any direction. You don't want to use them right there. In a lot of cases, to go back to fish, stalemates might be not costly at all. A lot of fish hide out in weeds, just hiding out avoiding predators and only come out once in a while to look for food. If you're not sure where food is, it doesn't really matter. You can just hide out some more. It's pretty safe, and then wait a little while trying to make a decision again. And then when you do make a decision, because you allow stalemates, that decision is more likely to be accurate, and you'll find food and avoid predators with a higher probability.I thought this paper was really cool and it was spearheaded by Claudia Winklemeyer, who's now a PhD student in Berlin. It introduces this idea of stalemates as a possibly useful function in some cases for animals. Maybe humans. We haven't thought too much about that, but, yeah, instead of casting stalemates in a uniformly negative light, that in some scenarios that could actually be really useful for collective accuracy.Michael: Well, I hope I don't offend anyone who loves me by saying this, but it sounds a whole lot like the way most people describe their marriage. To shoot from the hip yet again, it sounds almost like this work is analogous to other work that has suggested that there are... It’s like the Lokta-Volterra equation. There are stable populations of predator and prey in balance with each other. If you regard each one as a sort of evolutionary model of its environment, then you don't want either of them to win the game. Right? If every type of organism is a proposal by the biosphere about how the world is, then the entire biosphere is the actual answer to that question, right?  The wisest people I know are more than willing to cross the aisle and engage in synthetic discourse with people that they violently disagree with.If you start to see it the way that I feel your research paints things, then political polarization may be actually adaptive at the level of this society. Or like in philosophy, materialism and idealism, are these completely robust positions that neither one of them seems to have been able to win out against the other for thousands of years. If I’m going to be bold here, I feel that seeing your work in a certain way allows one to restore their faith in humanity, because you realize that all the people that you think are idiots, that you disagree with, are contributing to a more intelligent, more creative society and that if everyone agreed with you, we'd probably go off the cliff right away.Albert: Yeah. There's a collective cognition, probably a collective memory as well, where culturally, we're storing all of these different ideas and beliefs into our “cultural cloud” and any one person in that society will disagree with the majority of those, but it's useful to have those as a library of ideas. Not even stockpile of ideas, but a generator of new ideas and new directions of thought and inventions. Yeah. As an optimistic note, that could be a really useful function of social interactions, culture, society. And if we were homogenous, and we all agreed with each other, then something's wrong. We're doing something wrong. We're not taking full advantage of what we could, as a culture.Michael: I guess just to send everyone out on a note of curiosity and intellectual adventure, I'd love to hear you talk a little bit more about the questions that are animating you right now in your research. What's on the horizon for you? What do you feel is naggingly, painfully unresolved?Albert: Yeah. I think at the start of this conversation, I was talking about this paper we just finished about this broad view of “Why are organisms social?” I think that's very thought provoking. In that paper, what we found is that, how group sizes change under different conditions can be really informative about why a species is social. Say in drought conditions, when food becomes really scares, a lot of animal groups gets smaller. It's like lions, things like that, which makes sense intuitively to us, but then other groups get bigger when food gets scarce. Some bacteria, locusts form this swarms when food runs out.Our model found that whether a group has increase or decrease, or they don't change, really reflects the underlying reason why they're social. I think that's a really simple, but big question of fundamentally, what's the major reason why this species is social or that species is social? We have guesses. For fish, a lot of times, we think it's for predator avoidance or for locusts, it's to find food. We don't really know that for sure, for any species.When I was working on this paper, I was thinking that, it's so important to know why. For example, if you scanned across the tree of life and really figured out if you had a trillion dollars of research money and 10,000 undergrads, you could figure out specifically why are each of these 1,000 species social? It'd be so interesting to look at that catalog. Is it that there's a certain benefit, a sociality that dominates across the tree of life? It's like it tends to be this one benefit, and then rarely is it this other benefit. And you can think broadly about the evolution of sociality. So maybe if that was the case, maybe a lot of organisms became social for a similar reason, and then they accrued other benefits secondarily, like flying in a V formation for energetics, or whatever. Maybe that's a secondary benefit.So I think looking at the super-zoomed-out view of the tree of life and sociality, from bacteria, to elephants, to birds, and trying to think of, what's the distribution of benefits? Why are they social? How do they evolve to be social? For me has been really thought-provoking. Becoming social is a major transition in evolution. It's tied to multicellularity, it's tied to the evolution of eusociality. I think understanding very broadly why things are social takes us some distance to understanding evolution in general and biology in general.Michael: Awesome. Very important questions. Yes.Albert: I hope so.Michael: Right on well, Albert, thank you so much for indulging all of my free wheeling nonsense and telling people about your super-fascinating work.Albert: Thanks a lot. Yeah, thanks for giving me the space to talk about my research. It's been really fun.
20,Episode Details / Transcript Michael:  Melanie Mitchell, it is a totally intimidating delight to have you on Complexity Podcast.Melanie:  I hope I'm not too intimidating,Michael:  Quite friendly actually! I like to start these conversations by inviting you to talk about how you got into science in the first place, to give us a little context about the the curiosity and the passion that drive your research and how you got your start.Well, so when I was very young, I always really liked logic puzzles. You know, those kinds of puzzles that you get in books that you can solve, and I just spent a lot of time doing those. And that was a lot of fun. My dad was a computer engineer. Back in the days when people were building mainframe computers. And the computers had, very little memory and you program them in Fortran, and so I learned a little bit of programming from him. He built a computer in our house, which was kind of a strange thing to do in those days. Now it's more normal. But it was a big thing.But I really got excited about science, I think when I took physics in high school, and we covered Einstein's theory of relativity, and that was just completely mind blowing. And just the fact that you could gain an understanding of the world just by thinking about stuff, just by thought experiments, just was amazing to me. And that was really excited. So I decided, I also read a book by an astronomer named Harlow Shapley. I can't remember the book's title, but it was about all of sort of how much knowledge you could gain just by looking at a star through a telescope. You know, and what was that light, what knowledge that light could give you about the star and about the universe. And I decided that I wanted to go become an astronomer and a cosmologist. So I started out in college majoring in physics. But I turned out I really didn't like it very much. I felt very intimidated by it. I really did not feel like it was, at least what I was studying was calling out to me.So I ended up switching my major to math, and then was kind of a little bit, but I did research and astronomy actually, which was a lot of fun. But I was a little bit lost. As to what I really wanted to do after I kind of gave up the physics idea. And then a little bit after college, I read Doug Hofstadter, his book Gödel, Escher, Bach, which got a lot of people into computer science, including myself, and I decided I wanted to go to graduate school computer science and work for Hofstadter. So I did. I ended up convincing him to take me on as a graduate student and he was going to University of Michigan. At the time moving there. And so I went there. And that kind of started a whole cascade of lucky events that got me here to Santa Fe Institute.Michael:  So, your entire career when you gave a presentation on the history of artificial intelligence research here at FSI for the symposium last year, you talked about there being you know, this, the way that we have researched, this has changed along with the way that we have understood intelligence itself and that these two things are really intimately related. That we can't just deploy engineered intelligence without understanding it first. And so I'm really curious, because, you know, over your career you've been involved directly in in a lot of these projects. And I think maybe the place to start is with Copycat, this program that you developed with Hofstadter and the implicit model of intelligence that was built into that, and then how that is sort of different from other strains of AI research.Melanie:  Absolutely. So people sometimes asked me, how did I get into complex systems. And the way I got into complex systems was through my work with Hofstadter because his view of intelligence was that we had to model it as an emergent system that came out of many of what he called sub-cognitive activities. And it wasn't he doesn't he didn't mean activities in the brain, although eventually, it would have to map on to that, but he meant very much a kind of complex system where you have all these different agents that are interacting and sharing knowledge and competing with each other. And out of this, you get some kind of concepts and representations of situations.So his idea was to try and model this in a computer program. And the domain that he chose was, first he was interested in sort of these visual abstraction problems called Bongard problems, which I can talk about later if you want. But then he realized that would be really hard to do. So he made us version of them that was much simpler using letter strings to make analogies. So an example is if the string A,B,C,D changes to the string, A,B,C,D,E, what should the string P,Q,R,S change to? And a lot of people would say, okay, P,Q,R,S,T. This seems like an incredibly trivial problem. But it turns out that you can take make these analogy problems with letter strings that require quite a bit of creativity and insight into recognizing patterns. So his Hofstadter’s idea was not to build a program that was for the purpose of making letter string analogies, but rather to use this domain as kind of a way to explore his kind of architecture for intelligence, his ideas about how perception and cognition are related.So, my assignment when I showed up in his research group was, “Implement this!” And he had a kind of a paper that he had written kind of a manifesto about his ideas about how this should happen in a program, but it was less thorough than I think he thought. So it really took quite a bit of thinking and working out ideas about how to develop a program that adhered to these ideas about intelligence in general, that would then display how it worked on the letter string domain without getting too specific, so that it couldn't generalize. So that was copycat. it solved some problems in the letter string domain, but hopefully did it in a very general way then could be applied to other domains. And in fact, it has been.Michael:  So in your book you talk about where copycat started to fail. One of the examples was A,Z,B,Z,C,Z,D is to A,B,C,D, as…and then another letter string. You talked about how it wasn't able to abstract. It wasn't able to come up with new concepts on the fly.Melanie:  That's right. Yeah. So copy had had a set of concepts that we gave it like that were relevant to the letter string world like, you know, accessor in the alphabet, predecessor, new alphabet, grouping of letters, all kinds of different concepts that, you know, you would try and apply to any problem that it was given. But one thing that people do is that they come up with these temporary concepts that they use all the time. So an example in the letter string world is if A,B,C changes to add, so you might say see changes to its successor. What does A,C,E change to? And people will, like they'll count they'll say, A,C,E, each letter is separated by two letters. And so you should say, A, C, G. Okay, so that idea of like the double successorship that's a concept that we can easily create, you know, we can take the concepts we have and extend them and this this kind of way, but copycat didn't have that ability. But I have to say that you know, Copycat, it did work. On certain problems, but the most interesting aspects of it were its failures, because that's what really taught us. Like, what kind of how subtle this whole domain is how subtle the problem of perception is. And kind of what the program was lacking.Michael:  I guess we could take this in one of two directions. Maybe we should take it in both Yogi Berra style. One of them is an issue that you've spoken on about the problem of autonomous vehicles and edge cases, and how it's very difficult to train a machine intelligence to respond in an adequate way to scenarios that we ourselves cannot foresee, or the scenarios in the long tail that are exceedingly rare. The other one, I think, maybe is a little bit of a shorter bridge. I forget who it is that you quoted on this, but you talk about thought being made of concepts concepts being made. analogies.Melanie:  Yeah, so that was Yeah. From the book by Hofstadter and Sander about analogies.Michael:  Okay. Yeah. So I was delighted to find out in your book you have a section on Lakoff and Johnson and Metaphors We Live By, which was the book that blew my mind in college and like completely transformed the way that I understand thought. And so, yeah, it seems like copycat as well as a lot of AI stuff is stumbling on sort of trying to build thought, in a way where the ladder doesn't actually reach the ground. Where it's like the we're programming and concepts in order to get analogies, but it's like we have to start with analogies and build up?Melanie:  Yeah. I don’t know if this is what you're talking about. But people when I talk about the symbol grounding problem. The idea is, if we have some kind of noun in our language, let's say a good example. Like “tree.” And you could tell you could get a computer to reason about trees, you could tell it that trees are plants that plants need water. Therefore trees need water. And you tell it all you can give it all these rules about trees, all these facts about trees, but the question is, if it's hasn't ever actually interacted physically, either with sensory perception or literally physically, hugged the tree, how can we say that it actually has a concept like that? The concept isn't grounded in the real world. So there's a lot of debate in AI, whether symbols like that we teach machines have to be grounded in some sense in in real world experience, or whether they can learn about concepts successfully without that kind of basic grounding that we humans experience.Michael:  So it seems pretty directly really related to the embodiment issue, right? And how much does the body of an artificial intelligence matter? It seems like if our desire to engineer intelligence is about trying to reproduce the organic forms of intelligence we're familiar with, it seems like fairly inescapable that we actually need to anchor these things in the physical world. For example, Diana Slattery, who wrote Xenolinguistics, talks about how the kind of languages that might emerge in zero gravity, like Lakoff and Johnson talks about this, you know, we have this sense of somebody who's sprightly, and you know, up, these are happy people, and somebody slumped over is sad. And so we extend these metaphors to metaphors about like the market is up, which is good. And yet in space, if you don't have an anchor of gravity pulling you down, then the way that we connect these things, the way we build analogies is going to move from the center out. So I don't know, I guess, I guess I'm just asking, what are your thoughts on him on embodiment? And do you consider the work that's being done, for example, with autonomous vehicles as embodied? Because it seems like the more sensors we put on something, the more we have it navigating real-world charts like we're getting closer, right?Melanie:  That's a good question. I think the term embodiment is something people throw around a lot and means different things to different people. That the idea is that, you know, a lot of AI systems, not robots, but AI systems that kind of maybe run on your desktop computer, don't have bodies. They're like brains in vats. They can't pick up something with their hands or put it in their mouth or do other manipulations of it. And a lot of our concepts, human’s concepts, are formed when we're infants by this kind of manipulation, that we're this physical manipulation, these physical experiences that we have. So the question is, can a machine ever have the intelligence of a human or the kind of concepts that humans have? Without this kind of embodiment?I think it's an open question. And it sort of depends on what you want the machines to do. Because clearly, they can do symbolic mathematics without bodies, that's perfectly fine. They do great. They can compute spreadsheets, they can do all kinds of different things. But the question is, the kinds of AI that we humans want them to do, can they do that? Like understand language, have a conversation with with a person and actually be able to respond to them in the way that is useful to the person? Can they do that without having the kinds of same kinds of experiences that we have? I think it's a big open question. I tend to think we need embodiment, that we're never going to get human level AI without embodiment. But you know, it's not something you can prove. Intuitively it seems right. But I seen other arguments that, you know, may also be right, who knows,Michael:  When you were talking to Lex Fridman for his podcast, you talked about how difficult it is to separate intelligence from the desire for self preservation and from our emotions. And everything I know about developmental psychology suggests that human rationality emerges out of sort of emotional sub-units. And I'm curious, the sociality, the social dimension of this, a lot of the work—to connect this to work that lots of people here at SFI are doing—it’s very hard to define a human being in a way that is that is not a social definition. And a lot of, if we’re talking about training an infant, almost all of the training of an infant is done in society. And so I'm curious how you see that reflected in the way that AI research is being done or how you see that it is not being reflected.Melanie:  It's a good question. It's just complicated. Humans, as you say, are social organisms. That's just how we exist. Babies, as you say, learn, usually from their parents, or other adults, because they are in an emotional relationship with those people. And therefore, a lot of cognitive effort goes into modeling other people, trying to understand other people and their goals and their theory of mind. And that's extremely important for us in our lives. The question of whether AI needs that kind of thing is another question. And again, it's very similar to the embodiment question. It kind of depends what you want it to do, and it's not clear. Do we have to bring up an AI baby like we do a human baby? And give it the same kinds of experiences, kind of program in the same kinds of need for social interaction? Is that going to help it be smarter? I don't know.Michael:  I mean, that's that's sort of remember years ago, Kevin Kelly said that the the market just doesn't tilt that way. Like, if it's gonna take us as long to raise a human-like AI, then what's the point? And then that actually the market forces are moving into a more of an ecology of non-human intelligences that augment and supplement us. It seems like over the course of the history of this, this thinking. I mean, even 20 years ago, it was odd and kind of heretical to talk about the intelligence of a forest, for example. And now, you know, the the way that we think of intelligence, the way that we think of computation, at least around here, these things are kind of bleeding into each other.Actually, here's a kind of a more focused way to ask this question stuck with Nihat Ay yesterday about the role of feedback because a lot of neural networks, deep neural network systems are just feeding one layer forward into the next layer and building associations out of that. But in the eye, we have all of these reverse wirings. This is why we get all these weird optical illusions because your brain is expecting to see something, to get information from the eye. So I mean, this seems related to the sociality issue: how recursion figures into intelligence, whether it's human-like or not.Melanie:  I think the way most cognitive scientists think about human intelligence is by humans construct these mental models of the world. So you might have a mental model of some particular situation like, you know, walking into a room. And there's a lot of feedback involved because there's these feedback links in the brain between perception and higher-level cognition and the motor cortex and, and you basically your behavior is happening over time. And so at different periods during time, you get lots of feedback and you use that to figure out what to do next. Deep neural networks on the other hand, as you said, are primarily feedforward. They don't have feedback connections. They use feedback to learn in their learning phase. But once they've been trained, they have this operating phase where everything is feedforward. And they don't build these kinds of models. So psychologists talk about “perceptual categories” versus “concepts.” They're different.So you might have a neural network that learns how to recognize cats, dogs, cows, sheep, and it can tell the difference, because it's been trained on lots of photographs, or something like that. So it has perceptual categories, it can look at the difference between these categories and sort images into the different classes. But it doesn't have the same kind of model-based concepts that we humans have that allow us to combine modalities, to reason about these entities. Those models do seem to require this kind of temporal feedback and this interplay between what we expect to perceive and what we do perceive, you know, bottom-up versus top-down. And this is something that people are now really thinking about very seriously in AI trying to get systems that actually built these sort of models or ways to kind of internally simulate situations.Michael:  Yeah, this issue of abstraction and the role of feedback and and recursion and abstraction. Again, this seems related to a  really interesting strain of research going on here in SFI. Work like Albert Kao doing on collective intelligence work that Jessica Flack is doing, on the way that our models of our role in society, the way that we are evaluated by others, creates like a new layer of individuality that emerges above the members of a human society.Melanie:  Yeah.Michael:  There’s a point at which, for example, the, you know—again, you talked about this with Lex—that there's a moment in which the agency of an institution takes over from the agency of the members. You know, the people working for that company or whatever. So, yeah, I mean, it seems like there has to be a multi-scale structure built into this and some, at least internally, if not externally, something that looks like a social world in which the agents are modeling themselves in light of one another.Melanie:  Yeah, I mean, I think social intelligence is very understudied in AI. Collective intelligence, this the kind of things that people are looking at here at SFI is not mainstream in AI at all. Most AI systems are trying to get a computer to do a particular task, you know, sort of recognize faces or transcribe spoken language or translate between two languages. But they're not trying to model how we might build models of each other, and use those to interact, to maybe improve our status in the society. So I think that's something that AI is going to need to grapple with, especially when, for example, we have self driving cars that are interacting in our society. They're interacting with pedestrians, they're interacting with other vehicles, they're interacting with, with animals and other kinds of things that are out there in the world. And it's going to involve something quite different from these narrow tasks that AI has been so good at to date.Michael:  I'm curious if you're comfortable, extending the metaphor. You know, I bend towards these perhaps absurdly large and encompassing analogies. But I've heard other people describe capitalism itself as a form of artificial intelligence, and the institutions that we create—economic institutions, corporate agencies—we drop this self organizing thing into a landscape of incentives. And to us it appears like it has no mind of its own. And yet it's still subject to evolutionary pressures, and it's still adapting intelligently. And so it seems there's this other inquiry, which I'm curious about to hear your thoughts on, which is how this study of AI might bleed out into considerations of the ways that we are training what we think of as dumb systems that we do not regard as AI, except, you know, in a kind of renegade way.Melanie:  Yeah, I think the word intelligence is, is used in a lot of different contexts. So, you know, we talk about, you know, we humans are intelligent, other animals are intelligent you might talk about the intelligence of a market, like in an economy. And I don't think we have yet define these terms very well, so that we can analyze what we're actually talking about, you know, there's different kinds of intelligences. It may be one of those words, like complexity, that's a little too broad for what we need in science.I think a lot of people have said that these terms that we use, like “understanding” or “consciousness,” or “cognition,” they're placeholders for the things that we don't understand scientifically and the terminology will change as we understand them a little better. And so maybe we will be able to see if we when we say, “The market is intelligent, whether that's really the same kind of intelligence that we're talking about when we talk about how people are intelligent.” I don't think we're quite there yet.Michael:  If we're going to coast this swampy terrain of poorly defined terms, it would seem like the market as an intelligent agent would be subject to the same sort of perceptual restrictions that a lot of the AI that we're building now is in terms of how we’re not giving it rich feedback in a sort of social ecosystem, in which it's capable of developing a model of itself. I'd be curious at this point, it seems like it's worth bringing in…you bring up metacognition in the book, and how Copycat was extrapolated into this other piece of software called Metacat. And I'm, I'm curious how you see the role of—saying this very carefully—the role of self awareness in all of this.Melanie:  Right? So I just wanted to get in the what book we're talking about, which is my, my new book called Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans. And in that book, I do talk about sort of the state of the art of AI. I talked about some ideas about what human cognition human understanding is. And one of those things, as you say, is, is this notion of metacognition, where we're able to think about our own thinking. Or I can think about your thinking I can develop a model of my thinking or your thinking.So Metacat was a successor to Copycat. It also solved letter string analogy problems, but it did it in a way where it was able to, in some sense, observe its own “thinking processes,” you know, with scare quotes around the thinking. It was able to describe whether what it thought it was doing at a higher level and whether it was stuck, whether it was doing a good job or a bad job. And that's something that we humans use, we use our metacognitive abilities constantly. Typically we’re completely unaware of them, but we use them on ourselves and on other people. And metacognition is something that people in AI have thought about for a very long time, but it hasn't really made its way into the forefront of deep learning. Because as you say, the market doesn't feel that way. I mean, this is AI has kind of dual identity one is as a field that creates commercial products that make money for companies, like you know, face recognition and translation so on, but also as a scientific endeavor that's trying to elucidate what intelligence is. And those two goals don't always jive very well together.You know, it may be that thinking about the foundations of intelligence and trying to understand how human intelligence achieves what it does, doesn't necessarily translate into big money for companies. So the incentives are different. And right now, in the history of AI, we're seeing some of the first AI systems that are really commercially successful. And I think that's tilted the balance away from the more scientific side of AI. And people are putting more effort into more of the engineering side. I think it's going to tilt back, because I think people are going to run into big roadblocks, and already have on the engineering side that will only be solved by thinking more deeply and broadly about intelligence.Michael:  Let's talk about some of those roadblocks. In your book, which again, yes is one of six Melanie Mitchell books—and the community lecture, which we’ll post in the show notes, the talk that you gave on this topic—you run through this just hilarious list of AI failures. Like adversarial fashion,where you can deceive a facial recognition algorithm with a pair of glasses or a sticker.Melanie: Or a T shirt.Michael:  Yeah, there was a recent item in the news about somebody who got one of the Tesla autopilot vehicles to drive 85 in a 35. Yeah, now this kind of stuff, like where are the stumbling blocks right now? And how do you think that does reflect on theoretical failures or shortcomings?Melanie:  So I mentioned this notion of perceptual categories versus concepts. It turns out that if a neural network has perceptual categories without having more robust concepts, it's very easy to fool it. You can make a new image, say an image that it classifies very confidently as your face. There's Michael! And then you can put on a pair of glasses with the frames have a certain pattern. And now it's completely sure that you are, say, Brad Pitt. Because it doesn't have a human-like concept of you, it just has these perceptual categories, which are much more manipulable. So, that's one of the roadblocks I think, is the fact that these systems do not have full fledged concepts. I think that's true in in vision systems and language systems, and even game playing systems. You know, systems that have beaten humans at video games or chess and Go, they don't have the kinds of full-fledged concepts that we humans have that would allow them to, say, play a game that's similar but not identical to the one that they've learned. That's been shown, that being able to transfer their knowledge from one domain to a similar domain is very difficult and often fails. And I think it really is this lack of real concepts.Michael:  And other related question ties back into this lengthy history you have with SFI and the fact that as an institution we've become associated with work by people like Chris Langton on artificial life and this argument over whether life is unique to the substrate of organic chemistry. And when I asked social media about questions for you, one of the questions that popped up was about work that's being done in hybrid digital-organic systems or structured gels, this kind of thing. I’m curious, do you consider that a promising strain? Or is it like in Robin Hanson's Age of Em, where he suggests that we might be able to reproduce the human brain in silico without understanding it at all. It seems like maybe an organic approach to artificial intelligence doesn't really answer for us the kind of theoretical questions that we're trying to answer.Melanie:  So I don't agree that we could reproduce the brain but without understanding it. I think that's true for probably most very complex systems. I mean, it's it's a good question. People are very excited again about evolutionary computation methods where you evolve, say, computer programs, instead of programming them yourself. So one approach to neural networks for example is to evolve the structure of the neural network and to evolve the the weights and to do this kind of combination of digital evolution and digital learning. Will we be able to just kind of go go to bed at night and let our computers run in the morning wake up, and there's an evolved artificial intelligent system that we don't understand? Possibly. That possibly could happen. I'd be very surprised, because I don't think we understand…I mean, I think we're lacking…how to say this? Current day approaches to say evolution bottom up evolution and computers are lacking a lot of the mechanisms that biological evolution has. And one of the mechanisms is like being able to increase levels of complexity, like to go from single cell to multicellular, to systems that have modular organs and all of these kinds of levels of complexity that you get, and we don't have any way to do that with current day, evolutionary computation. Maybe someday in the future, we'll be able to do simulated evolution and actually create systems organically in that way, but I don't see it happening anytime soon.Michael:  I can kind of imagine if if you draw on Tom Ray's work in artificial life, you maybe imagine a system in which you incentivize. And you can try and model the same bias that it seems…again, heretically, it seems like a lot of the research at sci fi suggests that there is a sort of a trend toward the increasing complexity of the biosphere. Because each organism in some way contributes to a more complex ecosystem that raises the bar on intelligence. (I mean, does this sound crazy?)Melanie:  I think of it as you know, there's lots of different niches and evolution fills niches. So there's the niche that all the microbes, the microorganisms, fill. That’s a big giant niche. There are orders of magnitude more of them there are of us. So that niche is done. Now, the only way to differentiate, to get a new niche, is to perhaps become more complex. And, of course, I'm not defining what I mean by more complex.Michael:  Again, we're back in that tricky mess.Melanie:  Yeah, I’ll leave it to be intuitive. And so I think that's kind of what has driven the evolution of complexity is that need to find new niches. And there's a lot of side effects, like all the associated sociality. I mean, instead of just reproducing asexually, we now have sexual reproduction, which is much more complex, and it creates all kinds of side effects like sociality and that kind of thing.Michael:  So I mean, in that example, you know, something that I I think about all the time I probably bring up on every episode of the show is David Krakauer’s work with Martin Nowak on the emergence of syntax and human language, you know, they wrote about it as a way of avoiding a so called “error catastrophe,” that as the relevant features of your environment become more complex, it puts a pressure on the memory of the organisms trying to navigate it. That then leads to a shift from just remembering one new word for every situation to coming up with a way to combine words and create parts of speech and create sentences. And so reading that, it seemed like it was very analogous to the evolution of multicellularity and complex life and eusocial organisms. That there are these informational thresholds where adopting a multiplicative approach is just cheaper than trying to continue adding and adding and adding. So I guess the question is, if we were to assume that this is baked into the way that evolution works, at what point are we going to start seeing a kind of evolution of sexuality in AI? Is that kind of thing even going on right now?Melanie: I think people mostly built that kind of thing into their algorithms. To actually evolve that from scratch? No one's shown anything like that. We don't have the ability that biological evolution does, which is this very open-ended evolution where it can evolve all kinds of increasingly complex structures. Whereas our current digital evolution programs don't have that kind of open-endedness at all. Now, I thought it was really interesting that Rod Brooks, who’s who's a big name in robotics and AI, recently on Twitter, he had this thread about how he thought evolutionary computation was going to become sort of the next big thing in AI, it was going to revolutionize the field, sort of in the way deep learning has maybe even more. But only if we're able to capture some of the things that biological evolution has been able to capture. So, to make it more biological, to make make it have this open-endedness, this is going to create this revolution. So that was that was interesting. I think that's possibly plausible, but I think it's going to take a long time.Michael:  You mentioned in the AMA you gave this week about on The  Next Web, which we will also link in the show notes. somebody asked you about genetic algorithms. And they're like a kind of a revival of interest in that work and, you know, building epigenetics into this kind of thing. I'd love to hear you talk more about that like to distinguish that approach from these other approaches.Melanie:  Well, I think, you know, evolutionary computation ideas have been around since the beginning of the computer age, just as neural networks have. And what happened with neural networks is that all of a sudden, we have huge amounts of data and huge amounts of compute power, and so we're able to get systems that no used to not work very well at all, suddenly, they work incredibly well on certain tasks. So the same is happening for evolutionary methods. You know, evolutionary methods also can benefit from lots of compute power, and lots of data. And I think that it's seen a renaissance because of that, but like neural networks, I think there's kind of going to be some roadblocks in the fact that our current models of evolution that we have that we use in evolving neural networks are extremely limited. They're just very loosely biological, just like neural networks are very loosely like the brain.Michael:  Like optimizing for a fixed landscape.Melanie:  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I think some major new discovery has to happen. To get kind of over this hump that we're seeing both in neural networks. Kind of the plateauing of progress. And also in evolutionary methods.Michael:  It almost seems like the next big push in AI is contingent on research into the origins of life. They’re kind of asking the same question, which is, how do you jumpstart this open-ended process in the first place?Melanie:  Yeah, it's all related. So I think the biggest question is, is progress going to come just from bigger compute power, more data? Or is it going to require some something really new? And that's the big question.Michael:  I'd like to shift a little bit into an exploration of the way that these ideas are actually landing in and being worked on in in society and the way that they're affecting us now. Yuval Harari gave a talk at Google a few years ago on the new religion of Silicon Valley. And his “new religion,” the one he identified as an anthropologist was one in which the liberal self of the modern world has been replaced by this sort of meat robot. That we are all algorithmic entities. And that, as true as this might be, it's opened up some kind of concerning developments in terms of like social engineering, and the way that we have allowed ourselves over the last few decades to become, as Jaron Lanier puts it, like the operational extension of these algorithms that we've set loose into society. That each of us is just sort of an actuator being used by the social media robot.Melanie:  Yeah.Michael:  And I'm just curious how you think about this stuff. I guess this sort of ties back to that earlier question of whether a company counts as an AI, but it seems like the digital turn has created some troubling blind spots that are leading to large problems in society. Maybe the most obvious example and like one that you talked about in the book, and one that's addressed by the algorithmic justice group here at SFI is about, you know, the way that our implicit bias works itself into the algorithms that we design for offloading our decision making in justice or real estate or that kind of thing.Melanie:  Sure. Right. So I mean, if computers are learning from data, they learn what's in the data. And that's not always the thing that we hoped that they would learn or planned for them to learn. So let's say you lose a bunch of data about criminal sentencing. And you know, you have a person who's described by a bunch of features, then you have some data about sentencing and recidivism and all that stuff.Well, maybe it's going to learn that some statistical patterns in the data that might have to do with the fact that people who live in certain zip codes are likely to have more recidivism than people who live in other zip codes. Sure, it's true, but it's not the cause. Living in that zip code is not necessarily the cause of that. The system has no causal model of the world and how the world works. The system just Learning patterns from data. And so it's inevitable that you're going to get biases. We humans are wired to have biases.We saw that the other night when Rajiv Sethi gave a talk about our stereotypes and how and why we have stereotypes, and how they can be beneficial, and also very unbeneficial. But we don't just learn patterns from statistics, we have kind of these causal models of the world. So we're likely to know that living in a certain zip code, that those particular five numbers are not the reason why you did well on the SAT or why you went to prison. You kind of have this world model of causality. And we also have, as we talked about, metacognition. We’re able to look at our own cognition and say, “Wait a minute, I have stereotype, but I can recognize it as a stereotype.” So our neural networks that are recommending sentences or recognizing faces or what other kinds of things they do, they don't have those kinds of models or that kind of ability for recognizing their own biases. So if they're just looking at statistical patterns, they're going to absorb these biases, and they're not going to be aware in any useful sense of what the biases are.Michael:  I don't know if I agree with this or not. but it seems like a lot of people are concerned now that the way we have adapted to life online, you know, the way that we have adapted to being immersed in a world of these relatively rudimentary algorithms, has sort of impoverished, our own experience of our humanity. There's, like John Danaher talks about the unbundling of the self—the way that we've been become this n-dimensional data feed for advertising. The social consequences of this are in areas like the intersectionality and identity politics where you're like, “I am this and this and this.” And so, you know, we break ourselves down into categories.Melanie:  The same categories that advertisers break us down in.Michael:  Right. Even more broadly or generally that machines become more lively in the information age, and humans become more mechanical. And I'm curious. This is sort of the digital analog question, these aren't necessarily like concrete objective categories, right, but they do seem to yield different philosophies. There is a reflux going on right now. A lot of people returning to are almost for fetishizing the analog, and part of it is out of this desire to be irreducible. And there's this the strain in your work and a lot of work in in complexity science about the irreducibility of complex systems. What do you see in these trends? Ultimately it seems like it kind of dead ends in the question of like, human mind uploading. Like is it even possible to digitize a person? I'm really taking you out on the limb today.Melanie:  Is it possible to digitize a person?Michael:  I guess the the reciprocal of that question might be, “Can we even imagine something like an analog artificial intelligence?” Or, “Where are we going to find a balance between trying to reduce everything to its component algorithmic structure, and it’s n-dimensional data that we can gather about it, and at what point does that fall into the same theoretical trap that SFI has been arguing that we have to escape, in the way that we think about systems generally?”Melanie:  Okay, I kind of see what you're getting at. So, advertisers think of us as this n-dimensional list of features. And they use that to target ads. And it works surprisingly well. I mean, if you have a lot of data, and we saw that, you know, they can predict quite a bit about what you're going to do, what you're going to buy, who you're going to vote for, what kind of car you drive, and so on, based on just a small number of features about you. So it does feel very reductionist. And I don't know if it's a self self-magnifying feedback effect that as we're more kind of broken into these parts, you know, “You are a male between the ages of 24 and 34.” I'm just guessing. “You live in Santa Fe and you drive this kind of car and you know, you have this many friends on Facebook,” or whatever. And therefore, you're targeted this stuff to buy and you buy it and become even more like the this this group of people that you're being sort of pushed in with.I think it's there's some kind of feedback loop there that's very disturbing. Is our humanity reducible in that way? Well, I guess it depends what you want to predict. And the way society works. It's all it's very complex. To some extent, I guess we are reducible. But I think it's not a perfect algorithm. So in some cases, or with some aspects of ourselves we're not very reducible. I don't know. It's a hard question. I don't know how quite to think about it. I mean, I've been disturbed at how reducible I am.Michael:  Is this like Doug Hofstadter’s question of, at point can a machine do something that makes you sad?Melanie:  Yeah, “I thought I was more complex than that. And I thought I was more entrepreneur unpredictable.” But maybe I am really predictable.Michael:  to come at it kind of sideways from that already sideways question, you know, when Michelle Girvan gave a community lecture here and talking about reservoir computing and how adding noise to machine learning algorithms improved their ability to to predict the behavior of chaotic systems. You know, just training a camera on a bucket of water and kicking it periodically to generate waves, and then feeding that in, gave you weather predictions that were outperforming what we believed was even possible.I see something like, as we adapt to a world that is capable of examining us ever finer and more granularly people are starting to zag when they think the computer is expecting them to zig. Even back in the 90s Brian Eno was talking about he imagined in 25 years direct mail marketing would get so good that people would just start buying items randomly to throw off the profiles. So this seems like an arms race, right? At what point, and in what ways, do you imagine chaos enters in a meaningful way, here? Like the noise must be included in order to make sense of it?Melanie:  Wow. Yeah. I don't know. What you just were talking about reminded me of these new approaches people have to privacy in data sets, right. How do how do you anonymize data sets? There was this competition to improve Netflix’s predictions of people's preferences for movies and stuff in it? The people were given an anonymized data set. But it was actually pretty easy to figure out who the people were, even though it was anonymized. So now the approach is to actually introduce a bunch of random noise into the data set in a specified ways that doesn't affect the machine’s ability to use it to predict, but it does affect its ability to use it to identify people. So this is an approach to privacy that's getting a lot of a lot of attention now. So we're going to use randomness to protect ourselves from the ever-increasing scrutiny of our lives. And I, as you said, it's it's going to be an arms race.Michael:  Back to jamming facial recognition.Melanie:  Right, you know, with the glasses.Michael:  Or the trippy stickers. Yeah.  I want to honor the people on social media who wanted me to ask you about some other stuff here. One of the questions came from Mateo Quentoqui on Facebook, who wanted to know your work with Complexity Explorer and agent-based modeling more broadly, you've done a lot of work in getting agent-based modeling out into society and helping people think about this alternative methodology. He wants to know why you think agent based modeling has been so slow to catch on in certain fields, fields like political science, where it seems as though it ought to flourish. What is it about that particular technique that so many different disciplines resist?Melanie:  Hmm, that's a good question. I think there have been very influential agent-based models and say political science. You know, the work by Thomas Schelling are very early on work by Bob Axelrod have had a lot of influence on on people. There's good agent based models and there's bad ones and the good ones that really help, you can't necessarily expect them to predict the world very precisely, but you can get a lot of intuition from running them. Those, those are the best ones, in my opinion. So, you know, Axelrod's agent-based models that played the prisoner's dilemma. That got people's intuitions were really broadened by those and Schelling’s models. And some of the models that have come out of SFI have really broadened people's intuitions. And I see that as really the function of these models. They’re much more intuitive than a lot of mathematical models and you can you can poke them more easily. You can make changes and see what happens and kind of get an intuition, from doing little experiments on them. You know, another influence really influential one was the Boyd's model of the flocking. And that's I don't know that's gotten a lot of and the the Brian Arthur's El Farol model. So all of these I think have been pretty influential.Michael:  Yeah, I forget who it was but there was a fun ABM that came out last year on hipster fashion, sort of based on the El Farol Bar problem about, like, at what point do people flop and decide to act counter to the popular decision, popular behavior? Anyway, another question from social media, this one from from Aritra Sarkar. This one would be based on your own intuitive grasp on things that you've developed over the years. What problems in AI In your opinion, are good candidates for acceleration in the upcoming paradigm of quantum computing?Melanie:  Yeah, I get that question a lot. And I'm no expert on quantum computing. So my understanding is that there's certain algorithms that give you speed ups on certain problems. And it's not clear that a lot of problems in machine learning, say, map on to the algorithms that are known right now for quantum computing. So I'm not sure that very many problems in machine learning will immediately be impacted by quantum computing.I do have a colleague who is working on machine learning using the D-Wave quantum computer. There's some argument about whether it's doing quantum computing or not. But it what it does is you have to map your problem to a very specific kind of network. And then the quantum computer can find a minimal energy configuration of that network which is equivalent to a solution of your problem, and it can do it very, very fast. This colleague of mine does sort of machine vision inspired by neuroscience. And there are some problems that he's looking at which do map well onto this particular kind of network, which in physics is called an Ising model. And so therefore, he's able to solve them very quickly. But it does take a lot of preparation. So I'm not sure we're going to have a general purpose deep learning platform that runs on quantum computers. But I think there may be some very specific problems that can benefit.Michael: This question actually comes from Stewart Brand, who was a long-time SFI trustee.Melanie:  The Whole Earth Catalog!Michael:  Indeed, yeah! Stewart wanted to know, “How many levels of recursion is healthy?” Again, if we want to get into these questions about social intelligence and machines, my mind automatically goes to the awkward teenager, and at what point does self reflection begin to paralyze a system begin to interfere with its behavior in a harmful way. I think that's kind of what kind of what he was getting at.Melanie:  Yeah, that's a great question. You have too much metacognition I don't know how to answer how much is too much, or how much is healthy? But I think, God, it’s a great question. Maybe somebody has an answer. I don’t.Michael:  Like one AI can't work up the nerve to ask another AI on a date. Too much metacognition.Melanie:  Right!Michael:  We've we've kind of danced around this next question already in the show. But Marco Valenti wanted to know what do we know, if anything at all, about how the laws of causality are at work in complex systems. I know you're leading this reading group here on Judea Pearl’s Book of Why. Yeah, this is this is a question very intimately related to the work that David Kinney is doing here. And again, if we're going to be training AI to start to model cause and effect, then we have to have some understanding of these things. So where are we with this?Melanie:  Wow. Well, we had our first meeting of our Book of Why reading group yesterday, and it was very contentious about what causality is, and how to think about causality. You know, Judea Pearl has has pointed out that deep neural networks don't have any notion of causality. They just fit of data to a function. His view is that you're never going to get to human-level intelligence without the ability to think about causes, to think about counterfactuals. Like, what if I did this thing differently? What would have happened? That's a causal question. To me, it's seems very intuitive that causality is central to our thinking. You know, babies learn about causality very early, maybe it's innate, I don't know. They learn that, if you drop something that's going to fall to the ground, because you dropped it. It’s not a coincidence. I was kind of struggling with how to give machines, causal models. There's a lot of different proposals out there. But I didn't realize until I came here, and we started talking about causality, that there's so many different views about about it. It's such a philosophical question. So that's really good. That's interesting. And I'm now completely confused about that subject.Michael:  What are you working on now? Now that you're here? I mean, you're in residence here for a while now as the the Davis Professor of Complexity. Yeah. So what's on the table currently?Melanie:  Well, I'm really interested in this question. We've talked about already of like, what is difference between a perceptual category and a concept? And how could we get machines to have something like concepts? So this gets into how do we think abstractly? How do we make analogies, there's been a quite a few recent efforts, especially in the deep learning community to look at conceptual abstraction, using kind of these toy domains, these idealized domains, sort of like the Copycat domain, there's several different domains kicking around that people have looked at. And looking at how well these neural networks can do this kind of abstraction.I've been reading a lot of these papers, and I'm a little skeptical about what some of them have done. So I'm trying to dig into that whole area of conceptual abstraction, especially as being done now by various AI systems, and to try and understand what people have done and what's missing from it, and what my own ideas can contribute…sometimes write a paper about all of this. Hopefully, it won't take the entire year that I'm here to gather my thoughts about this! But it's what I've been thinking about. And I've been reading quite a bit about developmental psychology and how babies acquire concepts as opposed to perceptual categories.Michael:  Talk more about that. What is the difference in infant learning?Melanie:  Well, this is a good question. I mean, no, there's no real agreement there. But it certainly seems like babies very early on are able to reason about the way the world works in a way that a deep neural network can't. That they have something like a concept, the beginnings of conceptual thought that underlies all these sort of Lakoff and Johnson metaphors we live by. That we have these physical concepts and those map into more abstract concepts, and babies are doing that.So how are they doing that? Well, that's a good question. Nobody really knows. Nobody knows a lot of theories, but there's not agreement. And it's really interesting that one of the grand challenges in AI right now that's being funded by DARPA is called “foundations of common sense.” And the goal of the program is to build a machine that has the common sense of an 18 month old baby. By “common sense,” I interpret that as the conceptual system, and kind of goes through the same developmental stages that a baby does, like, knows about objects, learns about how objects have permanence, like if you hide an object, it's still there. These classic developmental stages that babies go through. Learns theory of mind. You know, there's this phenomenon where if you ask a two year old, “Show me that picture you're drawing,” they'll hold it up to their own face, because they think that if they can see it, you can see it. But there's certain age, I can't remember exactly, when if you ask that they they show hou they kind of have a theory of your perception. So it's fascinating area, and I'm trying to learn about it and try and figure out if any of these ideas that people have are going to be relevant for getting AI systems do these kinds of things.Michael:  I don't know enough about the field to know for certain whether this is true, but it seems as though a lot of the work that's being done in AI is assuming a kind of a blank slate model and that maybe we're not paying enough attention to the innateness. That there is the learning going on in an individual lifespan, but then children are born with all these instincts and identical twins are different. How much do you think innateness figures into this? And is anyone working on building innateness into machine intelligence?Melanie:  Yes. So this is actually a big debate, as it has been for AI’s entire existence and probably for the last 200 years of psychology too. How much are we blank slates, and how much are we born with some kind of prior knowledge? And it does seem that babies have some innate knowledge in the sense that they, they have the concept of “object” as opposed to “background,” and that an object is kind of a coherent thing. They have a concept of causality, that certain things cause other things. They have concepts like, certain things are animate, that they can move on their own, whereas other things are not animate, and they can't move without some animate thing pushing them. There's all kinds of things like that. There's a developmental psychologist named Liz Spelke. He who has catalogued what she calls “core knowledge.” This is sort of what babies either are born with or learn very, very early on, that everything else is built out of. So there's a whole group of researchers who are kind of taking that idea of the core knowledge and trying to put it into AI systems. And that's something that's fairly new in the area, at least in this incarnation of AI. And it's really interesting. It's something that I definitely think it's quite promising.Michael:  It seems like we're back to the question about evolutionary computation and how maybe if we want to design systems that work the way we're trying to make them work, we need to make an important differentiation between ontogeny and phylogeny. That individual AI systems probably have to evolve in some sort of ecology, where there is their own individual lifespan, and then there's an opportunity for evolution over generations. I don't know, but it just seems like AI research is sort of recapitulating evolutionary history.Melanie:  I don't think it is. And in fact, I think there's been kind of almost an allergy in the field to looking to biology very precisely. Now I think more people are interested in ideas from developmental psychology and neuroscience. And I'm hoping that here at SFI we’ll be able to kind of facilitate some of those conversations, to get people from these different fields together to interact with each other and to really think about intelligence more broadly.Michael:  When Adi Livnat not came out, to speak at SFI in 2018, for the Developmental Bias and Evolution workshop, he was making an argument that genetic mutation actually works by like a Hebbian learning model that like gene regulatory complexes were fusing as they were expressed, in a way that you see neurons wiring together as they're fired.Melanie:  Wow.Michael: That seems like an area where it work in neuroscience and AI is informing the way that we're actually thinking about evolutionary dynamics. I don't know. I'm after the grand syncretic thing here, but what terrain remains fruitfully uncovered?Melanie:  Yeah. There’s endless terrain, but can't cover everything. Have to save something for the next podcast.Michael: Yeah, we'll give it to them. I guess maybe the last question for you would be, you founded the Complexity Explorer program here. Which, as of 2013, was very precocious, you know, the idea of bringing all of these educational resources online. And now, seven years later, we have EdX. We have far more capable teleconferencing technologies. How do you imagine the evolution of online education? Where would you like to see this headed? What would you like to see SFI do with the future of Complexity Explorer?Melanie:  Yeah, that's a really good question. You know, one of the problems with online education is, it's so one way, we have the lecturer being videotaped, and then the videotape being watched by a bunch of people. And there's isn’t the backwards interaction. But I think that the new technology has made it possible to make these things much more interactive. And to have something much more like the the actual live classroom experience. I don't know exactly how that should go, but I'm hoping that that's something that people in online education can make progress on.The other thing is, you know, so, I mean, one of the things that happened to Complexity Explorer after I left, after I stopped being so closely involved with it, was that they started organizing these more project-based courses where students would actually do projects and projects would get feedback from other students, and if they created some kind of simulation, they get to post the demo of it online and other people could try it out. That's kind of heading in more in that direction of hands-on learning that you can do in this online way. So I think that's a really important way to go.The last thing I want to say is that I've always been fascinated by this concept of citizen science, where non-scientists, just regular people, can contribute to the kind of scientific questions they are interested in. There have been a lot of examples of this where people are collecting observations of things or they're playing games online that actually lead to more understanding of protein folding optimization and things like that. And I'm hoping that SFI, through its Complexity Explorer program, can do some more sort of opportunities for the vast number people were really interested in complex systems, but aren't working here at the Institute, to actually get involved in SFI research in that way. So that would be really exciting.Michael:  I mean, we've got 7200 people in the Facebook group, just waiting to collective intelligence their way into something like that.Melanie: Yeah. Say I'm doing research on some topic, I would have to figure out some way that I could tap into that desire of lots of people to get involved in the research and make it happen in this more distributed model. And I don't know how to do that. But I think that's where I'd like to see some of this going.Michael:  Maybe that's a question to the audience. Email us! Well, Melanie, it's been just awesome to get to sit down and have your time for this conversation. I really appreciate it.Melanie:  Well, thank you. I've enjoyed it. It kind of went all over the place, but it's been fun.Michael: So it is!
21,Episode Details / Transcript MichaelNicole Creanza, it's a pleasure to have you on Complexity Podcast. NicoleThank you so much. MichaelSo I like to start these episodes by inviting guests to talk a little bit about their own intellectual biography, you know, how you came to a passion for science and the study of evolution and how you came to do the work that you're doing? NicoleOf course. So I think my passion for evolution probably started in ninth grade. And I read in biology class, kind of the first inklings that I had about about evolutionary theory and learning about Darwin, and learning about how animals evolved in plants evolved, and immediately wanted to take AP Bio as a sophomore and just dig in as much as I could. I felt like this was an idea that made everything makes sense for me.And so I was an early devotee, and and that's kind of shaped I think how I think about the world around me and my interactions with it. MichaelSo a lot of your work emphasizes the cultural dimensions of evolution. And I think the right place to start is, in the broadest way, looking at the differences that we understand between molecular evolution and cultural evolution. What are those? What significant differences do we observe? Why does observing those differences matter to the study of social organisms in particular? NicoleThat’s a super interesting question. I think that that's something that I have been interested in in for a really long time, thinking about the parallels and differences between genetic evolution and the evolution of behavior. And I started out, in my PhD I want I thought I wanted to study animal behavior. And that was one of the things I was looking for when I was looking for graduate school and so I ended up studying birds.Someone has told me since that there are two types of people who watch birds in the wild. And obviously there's lots of types of people. But you can often categorize people into the ones who want to see as many different types of birds as possible and the ones who are content to kind of hide and watch a boring bird just eat and hide its food and interact with others and I definitely found myself in that second category, boring or not—and who's to call a bird boring?—but I really wanted to kind of figure out behavioral patterns and think about animals and humans and and how they behave the way they do, and how we think about about how ideas are transmitted in humans, and finding the parallels between that and how animals transmit their behaviors, and learn from one another. And so, I just kept building on these ideas becoming more and more fascinated by them. Michael What are some of the important distinctions to be made between say, Mandela and inheritance and what is popular, popularly understood as like memetic inheritance following, Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene? NicoleSure. So, I think that, that the main difference and that that's easiest to point to is that, as humans and for birds as well, and for many if not most other organisms, we inherit our genes from our parents, and we call that vertical transmission, and we can inherit our behaviors or learn our behaviors from many other sources. And so we have not only our parents but other adults in the population: people our own age, teachers who are dedicated to transmitting information, for example, and we can also come up with their own ideas, we can innovate, we can change our own minds.So the number of input sources that we have for behaviors and for culture is much higher in general and is not limited to kind of the time of our inception. That we also have our whole lives to acquire traits and behaviors and change them. And so there's the potential for so much more complexity, I think, in learned behaviors, as opposed to Mendelian inheritance, because we have so long, and so many sources from which we can acquire information. Michael There's a there's another dimension to this that you point out in a review that you lead authored for PNAS on “Cultural evolutionary theory: how culture evolves and why it matters.” You mentioned that it's possible that children are likely to reject cultural traits that they might inherit from their parents. I can't remember who authored this research, but I did see something about political dispositions oscillating over generations. Nicole Yeah, there’s a paper that's called something like “Haircuts, and hemlines” as well, about how things that you observe in your parents generation seeming particularly outdated or worthy of rejection, and that we certainly inherit lots of ideas from our parents. As much as you can point to examples of rejecting, for example, the political beliefs or religious beliefs of your parents. Those things do tend to correlate we do more often than not learn some of those types of traits, political beliefs, for example, from our parents. And so you can identify both patterns and that kind of very easily, anecdotally. You can see that culture evolution can be really complex. If you have some probability of adopting a belief and some probability of wholeheartedly rejecting it, you How do we look at evolutionary patterns, then? MichaelAnd then, a lot of your work has emphasized the nonlinear ways in which cultural evolution changes patterns of genetic inheritance, also. NicoleThat's right. Yeah, we think we think about a couple different ways that that could happen. You know, we all look for certain things in our partners, depending on what those what those things are, if they behaviors or beliefs or commitments to do certain things, then we narrow the field of people that we're willing to partner with, potentially by cultural factors. And so those can have evolutionary implications.People have realized for a long time that we're that humans are geographically structured that we're much more likely than not to to partner with someone that we are nearby at, and that we're, you know, likely to be nearby to where, where we were born, kind of over the course of evolutionary history. And so in addition to these geographic patterns, we can also see linguistic patterns so you're more likely to partner with someone who's whose language you share. And there's other beliefs that people and behaviors that people we call this assortative mating. And so you can assort on many different types of traits, and then those traits can become correlated with genetic evolution. MichaelMaybe it seems like the next step is to start with some of the things that you brought up in the talk that you gave it to Santa Fe Institute this week, on your work in in modeling the contact between populations, and using the diversity of tools and techniques available to different populations, and understanding how the the cultural repertoire is affected by migration between populations and by different kinds of food gathering or production. I guess maybe the right place to start with this is this paper that you wrote for the Royal Society Interface, “Greater than the sum of its parts” that was co-authored with Oren Kolodny and SFI External Professor Marcus Feldman. And it starts with a puzzle, which is this transition between the middle and the Upper Paleolithic and this what archaeologists have had, or I guess, palaeoanthropologists? NicoleYeah, both, I think. Michael…have had a hard time understanding about what they're seeing here. So let's start with that mystery. Nicole Are we and you're thinking 50,000 years ago, this one? MichaelYes NicoleSo the there's lots of mysteries in the archaeological record. This does happen happen multiple times in human history: you can point to certain points in human history where there seems to have been a sea change where in a relatively narrow timespan, things in the in the cultural tool record in particular seem to shift. And there's lots of hypotheses about these about these types of transitions. And, and one is, similar to one that Darwin had about the fossil record, which is that if you have a very sparse and imperfect record, you can see patterns that that might not be there. So you can, if you if you only have a dinosaur fossil from every million years, you might think that there was rapid change when there was actually a very slow change.And so that's certainly one thing that we need to think about with the archaeological record of human tools is that we we might have biased samples or incomplete records that could lead us to see patterns that that maybe aren't there. But if we think to ourselves that the record is representative of human behaviors, it does seem like there are certain periods of time when things when things have changed in relatively rapidly compared to the time period before.Around 50,000 years ago, some scholars point to the emergence of art and jewelry and musical instruments and a couple things that in addition to an explosion of different types of tools, and have sought to explain this relatively rapid increase in in what seems like human cultural changes. And something that that I talked about the other day in the talk is that often, researchers had pin these changes on other things that were going on. So either there was a dramatic environmental shift, there was a change in the human brain…people have linked this to the emergence of language that if we could transmit information in a different way, linguistically, that maybe all these different types of behaviors could accumulate rapidly.And something that we wanted to think about with and push against just just in terms of thinking in the vein of Occam's Razor, is this the simplest explanation that we can think of, that an environmental change or human cognitive change caused this big shift. And so, our hypothesis in in making this model and is that human culture itself could change the parameters of its own evolution. And so if we think about populations coming into contact with one another that have different sets of traits, different sets of tools, if they can combine those tools and and make plenty of new things that may be kind of an increase in your human population size or in in human movements could have led to an explosion of tools without having to invoke a cognitive genetic or environmental process. We can come up with other hypotheses, but the idea was, can we think of just a purely cultural process that would lead to some of those patterns? Or do we need to invoke something external? And so the the point of the model was mostly to kind of give this give this other null hypothesis. MichaelSo there's a couple of really interesting features of this model. One one is that you account for the way that these interactions might change the rate at which certain cultural innovations are forgotten. Many people, including Brian Arthur, have put forward models of the evolution of technology in which nothing is really lost, but that seems to be biased toward recent history. And so I'd love to hear you talk about that and your model shows about the way that technological advancements are stabilized by this kind of mixing. Nicole Yeah, so there's um there's a couple different things that we propose. As a background, there have been anthropological and archaeological studies of cultures that seemed to point to the fact that tools can be lost even when they're useful. So we it's unknown, the processes. We’ve had a lot of hypotheses because we can't go back in time and ask people why did you stop fishing or why aren't you making this tool anymore?So some of these hypotheses have to do with the rate of spontaneous loss and particularly how it relates to population size. So there's a very influential model from 2004 by Joe Heinrich, that postulates that population size is related to the rate of loss of cultural tools. Say that you're trying to make a needle to sew clothes, and there's a person in the population that you've identified as the best person at making needles, you would seek out that person and attempt to learn their techniques. And that on average, you're likely to do maybe a little bit worse than the best person. So you've picked a model, you've tried to imitate it, and you've come pretty close, maybe, but not to the level of proficiency of the master.But if, say, 1000 people tried to learn that technique, a couple of them might make an even better needle, they might kind of figure out a technique that was a little bit better. And so if you had a large population, every generation, your best model might get a little bit better. And then over the course of time, the average proficiency of that trait might shift upwards. Whereas if you have a very small population, just due to the sampling of that space of proficiency, maybe your average best model would decrease in proficiency over time.This was one mechanism by which population size could be related to the loss of tools. And so one of the things that we think about in in that paper is then if you have multiple groups of individuals, if this process is going on, or if other processes are going on, they might not have all lost the same set of tools. So if people are communicating with each other, if they're migrating, if they're contacting each other. Tools on average might be slower to be lost because they can be either reintroduced or a substitute for them could be introduced from another population. And so the isolation kind of also might lead to cultural losses that could be kind of reseeded if you have contact with our populations. And we also postulate in that paper and another one that things like writing systems or oral histories could preserve cultural traits as well…that if your best model of making that tool isn't as good as it used to be, but someone wrote down some information before, then you might have a better chance of preserving that that cultural process. MichaelYou’re talking about “lucky leaps”? Nicole Yeah, and the and that if you invent something like a writing system, that that people might or a drawing system or an oral history, that even if you get in a situation where only a few people were making some big innovation, only a few people were specialized in making a net or making an arrowhead or making you know something else, if people had written about it or drawn it, then maybe it's less likely to be to be lost or forgotten. MichaelOne thing that is really cool about this is that you're running multiple simulations, like you're talking about different populations of people. NicoleYeah. MichaelAnd then you're blending them at different rates. So there's there's infrequent or rare migration, and then frequent migration. And the rate at which cultural interchange is happening has pretty profound effects on not just the retention of innovations, but the accumulation of these sort of ratcheting innovations that maintain a memory or a history. NicoleYeah, and that's one of the reasons that we called the paper “Greater than the sum of its parts.” If two populations are having very regular contact with one another, that they could potentially have a maintain a culture repertoire that was greater than either of them would have independently or that a population of both their sizes added together would have. That you can design a simulation in which people are continually combining each other's tools and looking to one another for for innovations and kind of maintaining a cultural repertoire, that's larger than either would be on its own. And so that's this is a theoretical thing. This is something that happens in the simulation. But the idea is that if you make a certain set of relatively simple assumptions about how cultural traits could mix when two groups of people come together. You can make some of these different predictions about how the cultural repertoire would change when the populations are contracting with one another versus when they're isolated from one another. MichaelSo,  there's a nuance here that it feels important to make explicit, which is, like you said, infrequently associated populations might lose different technologies. And so it's more of an island thing where they're going to kind of drift off in different directions, but the more they're in contact with one another, the more their mutual understanding, their shared toolkit base overlaps, and so this seems related pretty importantly to conversations about globalization. NicoleYeah. Michael…and the way that we are seeing, at one scale a loss of local bookstores, regional dialects, this kind of thing. But on the other hand, as a species collectively, we're innovating at this completely insane, seemingly unprecedented rate. And I am curious to hear you expand a bit on that and how you weigh what is in one sense, a loss of cultural complexity—or cultural uniqueness—with an overall global gain. NicoleYeah, it's, this is a super fascinating topic. And I think that our models have tried to think about this a little bit or try to expand on this. But I think that there's also a lot of really interesting work that's coming out in both in laboratory experiments and in anthropological experiments.A lot of it shows that something that people call partial connectivity is actually the best thing for increasing innovations and kind of finding optimal solutions to problems. And so this is a really interesting concept. Actually Max Derex and Rob Boyd, who's external faculty here, have thought about this a lot: that if everyone is on the same page, so if there's if the world is totally flat, and we all know what one another are doing, I know how you're solving problems, and you know how I'm solving problems, and that's true of everyone that you come in contact with…it might be easier to solve problems in the short term, because you can kind of access everyone else's innovations and think about how everyone else is solving problems, but in the long term, if everyone converges on one solution to a problem, then the population overall is a little bit worse off. If I come up with a solution and you come up with a different solution, than if we have a harder problem, we have our unique or unique solutions to try to put together and see if they're kind of complementary in a way that helps us solve a bigger, harder problem.And so if groups of people or individuals make independent innovations, they can often be combined to make even even better tools or even better innovations later. Recently, I was asked to comment on a paper that I found really fascinating where anthropologists measured a real social network in several groups of hunter gatherers, and showed that if they were all exchanging information, a trait would spread innovation, they would solve the problem more slowly than if they were spreading the information according to their actual social networks which they measured by giving these hunter-gatherer individuals, things to wear on their bodies that told them how close they were to other individuals. And it would spread even faster if they were only associating with exchanging ideas with their kin.And so the more that they restricted their social networks, the faster innovations were able to spread and solve problems. And that's something that we get at a little bit with our model as well in in that if two groups of individuals are fully connected, if they're part of one population, and effectively indistinguishable from one another, culturally, that they have some repertoire of traits. But if they evolved their traits independently and didn't talk to one another and then later came together, they would have many more unique solutions to try when they were trying to figure out a solution to a problem.And so this, I think, is a really interesting thing to keep in mind when we're talking about globalization. I think that diverse groups are great and can solve problems really, really well. And increasing diversity in our perspectives is really important. And so thinking about kind of how groups of people that come from a different perspective when they when they come together, they have a lot of unique things that can try when they're trying to solve a problem together. I think that's something that kind of becomes increasingly interesting and important as globalization happens. MichaelI want to take this opportunity to link what you just said to work the Albert Kao talked about when he was on the show a couple weeks ago. And the work that he's done on social decision making and how over correlation can can impact that and his paper on modular decision-making and how coarse-graining at the level of the society by taking local polls, and then feeding them up into a higher level, seems to perform better under certain environmental conditions. NicoleYeah, it's interesting, I think people are converging on this idea from from multiple perspectives: that we don't want to all have the exact same toolkit when we're approaching a problem. MichaelYou talked about the Derex and Boyd paper in that piece Oana Carja and you wrote on “The evolutionary advantage of cultural memory in heterogeneous contact networks.” And specifically, you mentioned that if subsets of the population worked separately, and then compare their solutions, the partially connected network in the Derek and Boyd paper produced a diversity of perspectives that produced often produce better combined results then completely connected populations. That seems linked to other work that you've written on the value to kind of evangelize hear the value of interdisciplinary collaborations… NicoleYeah, yeah. Michael…and why it is that we're at a moment in the history of the practice of science, where it's no longer adaptive for us to remain siloed and chauvinistic in this regard. NicoleYeah. With with some of my colleagues, in particular Oren Kolodny and Marcus Feldman, we organized a workshop that we called “Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary approaches to cultural evolution”. But one of the things that we we realized, and and other people have realized also, is that the study of how humans change over time or how behaviors change is something that you can approach from lots of different disciplinary backgrounds. I come from an evolutionary biology background, but from anthropology and archaeology, this is obviously very relevant, but I think even in fields that we potentially collaborate with less often—economists or psychologists or cognitive scientists, human behavioral ecologists—these ideas have similar underpinnings, but are often either, studied in different ways or called things, different terminologies.And so I think, putting people together in a room and having them talk out, what do you mean by this? Are you published on this paper? Or have you studied this system? And are coming at it from a totally different approach? How is it relevant? How can we make our work, how to speak the same language that's been I think, a source of, you know, creativity for for me and for the field. So think about how people with different training and different kind of fundamental perceptions or ways of studying things, how we can all come together and try to learn more about, about behavior about humans about evolution. MichaelSo there's, this seems like a good time to segue into the the paper that you wrote with Laurel Fogarty and “The niche construction of cultural complexity: interactions between innovations, population size, and the environment.” You made a point in in your talk here, that you unpack in this paper about how there isn't a universal linear relationship between the size of a population and its complexity, and that this has to do with  the way that we deal with food. So I'd love to hear you talk about how this paper answers the like this debate in the sciences, about the relationship between these things and how you came about it. Like how you went into like attacking that problem. Nicoleof course. So yeah Laurel Fogarty and I have have been collaborating and and also friends for for a long time now. This idea is originally hers and then we got to write this paper together which was real a real joy. But the the idea that we had had been thinking about and circling around was that there there are different schools of thought, as you mentioned, when it comes to the relationship between cultural complexity and population size. If you make some assumptions about about cultural evolution, cultural processes, then you might expect larger populations would have more cultural complexity or more tools, a larger cultural repertoire, and smaller populations would not.But in some sense the the proof is in the pudding when you survey a population and you have a set of populations in a certain area and you try to count how many tools they have in that population, which is obviously hard—you try to count how many people there are, which is also pretty hard—and then make a correlation plot. And so, very hardworking people have been thinking about this in many different cultures. And they often come to different conclusions. And this has been a source of of debate in the field.One of the early and foundational papers in this realm was that Michelle Klein and Rob Boyd looked at fishing populations in in parts of Oceania and found a relationship that the larger populations had larger tool repertoires, more complex technologies. But people have gone to other other places and not found that relationship. One of the things that that came out of that was was a debate that you found this relationship, but I didn't. So it can't be universal, it can't be something that we talk about, or make as an assumption of human culture. And I think that's a fair point. But from studying niche construction, which we've Laurel Fogarty and I had both been had been thinking about to bolt together and separately, which is the process by which humans can alter their environment and thus alter their evolution, that maybe there was something related to the human interaction with the environment that might be related to this.So when we put together all of the studies that we could find, that had tried to make an association between human population sizes and cultural complexity, we saw a pretty stark pattern, which is that when people had surveyed hunter gatherer populations or other food gathering populations, they mostly did not find a relationship between population size and cultural complexity. But if they surveyed food-producing societies, so either agricultural societies, modern societies, other ways of producing food, they found this correlation between population size and cultural complexity. And so then our hypothesis was that maybe if we're saying, well, some population show this and some don’t so it isn't a pattern…maybe something that could explain the pattern is that humans that alter their environments, use their cultural tools or their technologies to modify environments in a way that produces food—agriculture is a canonical example—that maybe there's a different relationship between population size and cultural complexity, then there'd be in a hunter-gatherer population. And one of the there's different hypotheses that we could think about. That would link those ideas, one of which is that maybe populations that modify their environment to produce food are buffered in some sense against environmental changes, whereas in a hunter-gatherer population, if there's a severe drought or or other environmental change, the tools that they had been using might no longer be useful in the environment. So if there's a big foliage change, or say they move to a new location, maybe their tool repertoire is no longer well-suited to their environment. And so they instead of maintaining those tools, they they come up with new ones.And so their tool repertoire would then be associated with environmental fluctuations and less so with their population sizes. Whereas if you have a population that is sedentary, that is modifying the environment, that even if there's some environmental changes they would still use the same tool repertoire to do their farming. And they build on that, potentially. And so this is not necessarily the be-all-end-all of this debate, but it's one way of thinking about how we know humans are complex, they have complex relationships with the environment…does that weigh in at all on the relationships between culture and the people that have that culture? MichaelSo there’re a couple different dimensions to this model that seem really important dimensions to differentiate. One is the the harshness of the environment, and then one is its variability, the rate at which things are changing, and the effect that the interplay between those two variables have on the rate of innovation. And then the relationship between those things and population size. You mentioned that when the effect of the environment on survival, and the rate of innovation is strong, the effect of population size is more complex. It depends crucially on how fast the environment is changing.I'm reminded of Jessica Flack’s work on collective computation. In her community lecture, and some of her recent writing, she's pointed to the way that if you think of human societies as processing a collective computation, that we are, at the level of the society, encoding these coarse-grained details about the environment—but that that process breaks down when the environment is changing too rapidly. I'd love to hear you talk about the thresholds at which these different strategies emerge. You touched on this just a moment ago, but please go into more detail about what makes the difference in terms of the strategies for, you know, the kind of sort of pastoral environment that we're used to thinking about in terms of human history and the insanity that we've been living through as a species for the last hundred and fifty years. NicoleYeah, it's interesting, because there're different ways or different senses in which our environments can be harsh. And one of the main correlates of that, in the models that we've done, is how many problems are there for you to solve. In some sense, in modern society, we've buffered ourselves against a lot of environmental changes. You can exist in a place that’s indoors that's 72 degrees all the time and you always have access to food. But we do have this other aspect of harshness where we do have a lot of problems to solve, we have a lot of things that that we can improve upon in our lives. And we potentially have the resources to do that. And so this proxy for how harsh an environment is a really interesting kind of scale. Because if you're living outside, environmental harshness, or the number of problems that you have to solve that in your environment, might mean something very different than if you're in a more modern situation. And so, if we think about environmental change, those two groups are in very different circumstances. In a modern society, in this building and the apartments we live in and the houses, we can buffer ourselves against them. Mental change reasonably well up to the point where it impacts our food sources or impacts our communication with one another. But if you are hunting and gathering and living outside, large environmental fluctuations can have a big impact on how you live and how you feed yourself and whether or not you're migrating. And so I think that these these things we can we can think of them in numerous senses, and I think they're all relevant to humans. MichaelIt seems like whether or not we have constructed stable niches for ourselves at the level of, like, air conditioning, there’s a common misperception that we've somehow ended natural selection…when in fact, it seems like natural selection is just operating at a different time scale or a different level of organization than it once did. Different dimensions? NicoleThat's right. I think we've altered our own evolution for sure. But but the ways that that will affect long term human populations is not totally clear. And I think for cultural evolution, we certainly haven't stopped kind of the natural selection or drift or any other evolutionary process on cultural evolution on culture.  Our culture is still changing quite fast.A recent topic that I've been thinking about with of my collaborators, Oren Kolodny, is something that we're thinking of in terms of is necessity or opportunity, the mother of invention. So there's this phrase, “Necessity is the mother of invention,” that we point to to think about, when would we make a new solution to a problem? Maybe it’s that if we need something that isn't there, we figure out a way to solve that problem. But you can think of this both in a traditional context of humans interacting with their environment and also in a modern context. If we are kind of operating at our capacity for things we can handle, maybe we don't really have the time to to solve that problem. And so, in some sense, maybe opportunity is the mother of invention; that if I have the leisure time, if I have this wonderful week at Santa Fe Institute, I could potentially have let my thoughts drift to problems that I wouldn't solve if I was completely overbooked every single day. MichaelThis is why Johann Sebastian Bach wrote over 1000 works of music and his wife did not, raising all those kids. That’s an instance where opportunity is the mother of invention. NicoleYeah. And she probably made a lot of innovations in in child rearing! We can think about some of the modern luxuries we have, where if we don't have to deal with raising our own food or regulating the temperature around us or we can keep lights on later into the night. But there's probably some balance there, right? There's some interplay between needing to solve problems and having the time to actually do it. And so where where are humans right now on that spectrum, and how can we think about the kind of larger problems that cultural innovations might help us with, and how do we give ourselves the space to solve them? MichaelSo, to link this back to the paper on “The evolutionary advantage of cultural memory and heterogeneous contact networks,” you emphasize in that paper the way that network structure can support or suppress innovation and variance. I was left reading this paper that we're just discussing now, with this question about how the difference between hunter gatherer societies and agricultural societies seems like it's taken a new shape in the modern era. That it's not just about food production; it's about the production and supply chains of all different kinds of things, including commercial goods and knowledge. It seems like when we're talking about the the instability of the environment, that there's a complex interplay. We're not talking about foraging foods now; we're talking about countries that depend on other countries for manufacturing basic goods and services. Like, what happens if China stopped shipping things to the United States because of the coronavirus? When those networks break down, people have been warning about this for decades, about the danger of food deserts in our metropolitan areas. I’m curious what your thoughts are on how this research might translate to insights into the way that a global economy might be affected by the sudden introduction of new structure in the network. So, how we're actually relaying goods and services and information? NicoleYeah, that's a tough one. I think a lot of the solution to that type of problem depends on how long that how long the disruption lasts. One thing our models might predict is that if there's a short-term disruption of cultural networks, we would bounce back relatively quickly, but if it was a long-term disruption, we might not be able to in quite the same way. And so part of that, I think, is just what you're saying: that we would have to solve some problems that we wouldn't have to solve before. If we couldn't go to the grocery store and buy food, we would have an urgent necessity that we would that we would need to figure out. Our solution to that would probably depend on on how long it lasted. And then whether in a disconnected social network, we would innovate our own solutions, and hopefully figure out the ways to ways to survive and persist, which humans are quite good at doing. But I think it would take a very short amount of time before you realize that some of the knowledge you thought you had at your fingertips isn't isn't there anymore, and that you're you're forced to solve problems that you could have the answer to if your network connections still existed. That's something that would put modern humans in a bit of a tough spot, I think. MichaelTo get kind of morbid about this, there's a silver lining in this, which was that after however long that period of disruption might be, we will have pioneered all of these unique solutions to these problems. And maybe that kind of global disruption might actually kick us off of the local optimum we're stuck on because of the homogeneity of the global economy as it is. NicoleYeah, I think the models would predict that, and that would be my hope, as well. But I'll keep my fingers crossed for that for that outcome. MichaelSo I want to move to… You’ve done is about as much work on birds as you have on humans. And I think the the analogies that emerge from looking at these two strands of your work stereoscopically are really interesting. I would like to have you talk about your work with Laurel Fogarty and Marcus Feldman on cultural niche construction of song repertoire, size and learning strategies and songbirds. It seems like there are very similar insights to the way that different cultures come together and mix and learn from one another, and the repertoire of tools that they have available to them. And a set of similar evolutionary pressures on why certain songbirds species might have a larger or smaller song repertoires. Nicole Yeah, I this is something that I’ve felt very lucky to study and think about this. It's endlessly fascinating for me to think about why birds sound the way they do. And so my students and I have been approaching this from a number of different perspectives, kind of some of those are based on on that the work that I did with Laurel Fogarty and Marcus Feldman on this. And the general idea that we were thinking about is that when I started to study birds, I found really, really interesting with that different species of birds have very different songs. The songbirds, the ossine songbirds are a clade of birds that are that share a common ancestor. Somewhere in that lineage, they, they evolved the ability to learn to sing. Like you mentioned with a cultural ratchet, it doesn't appear that any lineages of this in this clade have lost the ability to learn to sing. So we have several thousand species of songbirds with a common ancestor tens of millions of years ago, and the cultural evolution of their song has been going on ever since. So we have millions of years of cultural evolution that we can study if we if we can figure out how to parse and analyze bird songs and think about their long term evolutionary history.Something that popped out to me as as being really fascinating is that some birds can learn to sing when they're juveniles. They they learn a song from an adult, potentially in the population. And then when sexual maturity hits the ability to learn the window of song learning closes. They have a sensitive period, and after that they can't learn more or modify their song. So they have this finite time period where they can learn and modify their cultural repertoire and then that's it.Several independent evolutionary events have led to lineages of birds that can modify their songs, sometimes throughout their lives. Mimics and mockingbirds, for example, learn to sing, and they can modify that song and mimic other birds in the environment for the rest of their lives. This is a very different learning strategy. And in humans, you know, we learn languages best before puberty. After puberty, we can learn languages, but it's kind of a textbook way of learning and much less like an absorbing-from-our-environment way of learning. And so we were thought to have a sensitive period for language learning, but then something like toolmaking, you might preferentially do later in life and we have the window of different types. Learning occurs at different lengths in humans.So I saw this opportunity to think about those two different strategies, you have a strategy. It's not a strategy that you opt into or out of as a birdl. It's a strategy or you're born with. Your strategy is either to learn your song early in life and have that song for the rest of your life, or to be able to modify a song that you have for the rest of your life. You might think, if the birds can modify their songs for the rest of their life, why wouldn't all birds just retain that ability? Why would that ability ever get lost in evolutionary history? Because it seems adaptive. It seems like if you're not doing very well with your song and attracting a mate, it'd be great to sing a different song and try again. And if you're if you're a bird that sings a very simple song, and it's unsuccessful in attracting a mate or defending a territory, you would have a second chance and that that fitness benefit might be great. So the thought process in the field was that maybe the ability to learn throughout your life is costly in some way, and that would explain why it would get lost unless it's critical for the birds’ reproduction or fitness. What we thought about in that paper is that if there's sexual selection for large song repertoires, that might be enough to offset the cost of learning throughout your life. If there's some kind of cognitive or metabolic cost of continuing to learn, then paying that cost wouldn't be worth it if the female that you're trying to attract is listening for a short and species specific sequence…but if the female that you're trying to attract is listening for maximum complexity, then maybe it's worth paying that cost to have longer to learn, to have a more complex song.Then after that paper, which is a computational theoretical paper, we looked at real birds and found a similar similar trend. We looked at bird species where people had found a correlation between song complexity or repertoire size and reproductive success. For some species, singing the most elaborate songs means the most mates or leaving the most offspring, and those tended to be the same species of birds that already had large repertoires. We thought in that paper in terms of predictions you might make with other sexual selection signals, like a peacock’s tail. There are some birds that have really long tails, and canonically, this is thought of as a sexual selection signal—that females looking for mates would look at the birds with the longest and most beautiful tails and say, “You know, they had to evade predators and find food their whole lives while maintaining this beautiful tail. They must be pretty good at stuff, they must be pretty successful.” And so we can think about that in the same way with songs. If we're thinking about which bird species would have sexual selection that rewarded very complex and elaborate repertoires, then at the species level, we would look for birds that had those elaborate songs. And then within those species, the individual variation correlates with fitness or reproductive success. MichaelSo I want to tie this to hypothetical work that I was just talking about with your husband before this conversation. Richard Doyle at Penn State, in his book Darwin's Pharmacy, puts together this argument that human language emerged out of a similar process of sexual selection for eloquence. NicoleThat’s interesting, yeah. MichaelIt’s related to, as you cite in your work, Robert Lachlan and Peter Slater's work on the cultural trap. And I'm curious whether you think this is a fair analogy, or under what conditions you see the complexity of the songbird repertoire, and also the open ended and extensive period of learning, appearing? Because it seems like it remains unresolved in human evolution, but it is a compelling argument: that it was the complexity of human communities, and this growing burden on us to be able to describe more and more intricate phenomena that led to this ratchet in which we became more intelligent as we became more social. That our ability to communicate and express ourselves eloquently became more and more important. Do you think something similar is going on in songbirds? And if not, what factors are selecting for these larger repertoires? It seems to be different than just a long shiny pretty tail… NicoleYeah, I think it's I think this is an interesting domain that we took to potentially compare humans and birds. I think we have to do so with obviously a large grain of salt. But the the something that that I some I haven't read the work you cite, which I would love to. It seems really relevant and interesting,I think Dietrich Stout, and Kevin Laland has also done some work on this: how do we transmit something like a stone tool? In the archaeological record, we find pieces of stone that clearly had a purpose. They could they could scrape things and cut things. And so we we have an idea of their function based on their structure. But what wasn't really known was, what would it take for me to to share that knowledge with you? Could you look at this stone and then me and say, “Oh, that'd be good for cutting,” and make yourself one? Or would you need an apprenticeship?What Kevin Laland's group found, was that these types of tools were dramatically easier to transmit with language than without. That just showing somebody and miming something, even if you knew how to do it, it was much more difficult to pick up the nuance than if you could explain in words what you were doing and why. And Dietrich Stout’s group found that it took many, many hours, a hundred hours of training and practice, to produce one of these stone tools. And these are things that are pretty early in the in human cultural repertoire. And so, with the caveat that now that we're good at explaining things in words, maybe we lean on that a lot…it does seem that human communication and human culture co-evolved and potentially facilitated each other's evolution.That's something that we can we can think about it with birds because I think the bird songs are often anecdotally compared to both human language and human music. They’re both a learned vocalization, so the parallels between both speaking and singing are kind of readily apparent. But recently I've been working with my postdoc Emily Hudson on this idea that maybe a bird song is actually more like an arrowhead than it is a like a language. What if the purpose or the function of song is more like a tool than it is like a communication behavior? So, thinking about the way that that these that songs develop and and whether they are measured by their complexity or by their performance metrics—“How fast I can sing, how stereotyped can I sing, or how complex I can sing?” At least now that isn't exactly how we're measuring our linguistic capabilities: we’re trying to convey information.So yeah, I think there're lots of parallels between bird songs and human culture and the way that they're learned and the way that they evolve. I think there're a lot of parallels. But it's been interesting to try to really tease apart. Thinking about a human cultural analog of bird songs, we can make a case for a number of different types of tools, or a number of different types of human behaviors. And which one of those is really the most relevant in which circumstance? It might be different if we're thinking about a bird that has a complex song versus a bird has very simple song that it needs to sing as fast as possible or as regularly as possible. MichaelSo that's where this other angle to this comes in, it seems with respect to what I remember from reading the Lachlan and Slater work on the cultural trap like fifteen years ago, was that the heterogeneity of the environment in which these birds live plays a big part in how far a bird that maybe only nests in one tree has to go to find another tree of the same species. There's something about having to learn a wider range of dialects, or something that ties loosely into these concerns that we've been talking about—about the amount of variability in the environment and how that affects us. There's this link between when I think about, in humans, the amount of education required as our as our society has gotten more complex. We're spending more years in school. We’re traveling further away and living in different cities that our parents. We’re having to learn entirely different customs. And so it seems like what qualifies as an adult is now twice the age that was, you know, say two hundred years ago. I'm curious what your thoughts are on geographic range and environmental heterogeneity and these kinds of concerns, and how that's figured into your thinking. NicoleYeah, it’s interesting. I think that for both humans and birds, there’re things that we can think about in terms of geographic range, as you mentioned, and also kind of environmental flexibility, like the number of environments you've been exposed to or whether you're a specialist in your environment or a generalist. This is something that people have thought about for a long time with birds that have dialects. So there're lots of species of birds where the birds in one particular region, sing something very similar to one another. And you can go a couple miles over and the birds sound very different. They've structured themselves by these dialects. So Peter Marler, I think I've heard that he used to say that you could drop in blindfolded in the Bay Area of California and he would know where he was based on the white crowned sparrow dialect he had mapped these out. He was very in tune to them. They were really geographically structured and geographically informative. So then the idea that kind of naturally grew out of that observation of of song dialects was that the birds that sing a certain dialect were well adapted to that environment. That they’d grown up there.Human dialects are potentially a little bit like this: you can recognize who grew up near you. And then you know, you have a set of common experiences, you're adapted to the same environment. And what that would predict genetically is that you might choose a mate that shares your dialect because you know that your mate would be well adapted to the same environment, and so would your offspring. And so the idea with song dialects was that they would potentially then correspond to genetic groupings, that you'd be more closely related to individuals with your own dialect than other dialects.People started to study this and sample sparrows in particular from from different dialects and compare their genetic variation. And it's actually somewhat analogous to the human cultural complexity literature where some people found it and some people didn't depending on the bird, in the species that they were studying, and sometimes even the subspecies. Like within the white crowned sparrows, there were links between dialects and genetic clusters in some groups and not others, and so then we're left with this kind of burning question of, when is being adapted to your environment something that would be beneficial for you to look for in a mate, versus someone who has a different set of experiences and is potentially more flexible?I think birds and humans are both worth maybe thinking about the same things when we when we think about, the individuals that we associate with and the individuals that we come in contact with and learn from. If they have our same environment, then we know that their information might be useful to us in our current context. But if we have someone that we're learning from from a different environment, then maybe what that does is kind of buffers us so that our information is useful in more contexts. For both bird songs and human behaviors and cultural repertoire, I think there's there's some kind of trade off there. And we we probably are all best suited doing some some mix of in our learning, seeking out information that's relevant in our current context and information that will be relevant if we if we spread our wings a little. MichaelNice. Yeah, that that seems related to one of the strains that that is constantly plucked around here, including work by Scott E. Page on diversity and work teams, and how the larger our context functionally that we inhabit, as social creatures, the more it seems to select for the ability to retain a kind of a cultural memory, like hedging your bets. I don’t know, I feel like we've covered a lot of ground! NicoleYeah, me too. I think you could sum up by saying probably both humans and birds hedge their bets as much as they can. And that the more you can learn and the more flexible your learning is, the better you might be at hedging your bets. That's probably an adaptive strategy. MichaelSo for you what remains one of the greatest unsolved questions in this domain? What's going to be keeping you up at night for the next few years? NicoleI think there's a lot but in the bird space, this idea of cultural evolution on the multi-million year timescale is is certainly keeping me up at night. Something that my lab is doing, and where my students are bravely forging new ground, is looking at bird songs that have been recorded around the world and deposited into citizen science databases and trying to extract information from those and say, “Okay, we have hundreds of thousands of songs that people have wonderfully recorded and submitted online databases.” There seems like there's so much to learn about evolution from that resource, so we've been building computational tools and graphical user interfaces to extract information from the birdsong and then we are trying to map that information back onto phylogenies. And then to think about the evolutionary history of the bird. If we look at kind of the evolutionary history of bird species, and at their songs, what can we learn about how behavior evolves over time and about the evolutionary constraints on how that might affect how a bird sings?In addition to all the problems a bird has to solve, if their voices might sound different if they are huge versus very tiny, if they learn for a long time versus not very long, if they're in dense foliage versus in the prairie, and so on. Then layered on top of that are the cultural pressures, sexual selection preferences, and the both male-male and male-female interactions that they're having. So thinking about all of the different evolutionary pressures on this learned behavior over time and space, what can we learn about how behaviors evolved over millions of years? It's a big question, but it's the one that's been really keeping me up at night for a long time. MichaelCertainly a more difficult question (or maybe not) than why birds seem to be subject to some of the same evolutionary ratchets, but have not yet achieved, or may not be able to achieve, cumulative culture. NicoleYeah. Why humans are so good at cumulative culture and other species are not—or maybe they're better at hiding it from us!—is a really interesting question. Thinking about social networks, cultural migrations, moving people moving from place to place, and the analogies that we can draw from that, and from our modeling and experiments on that. How can we think about them other animal behaviors is something that we're still working on. MichaelSo it’s not just the thumbs! Well, Nicole, thank you so much for your time.

22,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: So, yeah, well, Andy, how are you?Andy: Doing well. Are you at SFI? Are you also working from home?Michael: I'm working from home today, yeah.Andy: Is SFI pretty much cleared out or what's the atmosphere like?Michael: There are a couple people up there. You know, there's still a residual working group that Laurent and a couple other people are doing this week…but pretty much it was a ghost town.Andy: Right. That's a such a shame.Michael: I mean, it's interesting. I've been talking with people about how it's an opportunity at all levels, for us as a society, to sort of back off of these local optima we've gotten stuck on. To reevaluate our behavior and like maybe find a new, better solution, both as individuals and as institutions.Andy: I think from an environmental perspective, seeing how quickly levels of air pollution and things like that can be reversed is just going to create an opportunity to say, look, this can be done, if we all operate together, and the world will go on lower levels of production, fuel use, etc.Michael: Yeah, it could. Although, there’s the adjustment period.Andy: Yes. We will have a significant adjustment period.Michael: Before we really dig into it, how are how are things for you? What is what is research life look like at Princeton right now?Andy: Well, I’ve been in Panama for the last three weeks teaching. I teach this course on the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. And I always joke that most years, we get a disease outbreak that we monitor in the course. It brings realism to what we're doing, but this is certainly the most vivid example we've had. And in Panama, the virus didn't get there until last Tuesday. I was all set to come back Saturday. The students were supposed to stay on. But they all got pulled out by the University. So I had to reorganize them a bit. Everybody came back Saturday, essentially. And Princeton is really quiet. There are people sort of walking around and isolated groups, the road traffic is down. There's a bit of rage when people are trying to cross each other at intersections because they seem there's no traffic, so they’ll just run the light. And so there's people shouting and screaming at each other a bit more than usual, that the campus is now totally deserted.Michael: So I'd love to hear a little bit about how this real world example is facilitating you teaching epidemiology in your course. I mean, while we're while we're on the subject.Andy: Well, it works very nicely because everyone on the course is expected to do a research project and also to look at a neglected tropical disease. So we just keep a daily update of where the virus was, what the numbers of cases were in China and what the number of cases were in Italy, then Spain, as an example of this is an epidemic really taking off in real time. And we'd have discussions over dinner about what sort of measures should be brought in to stop this and what epidemiologically can we do and what ethically can we do? I mean, the course is also great in that we're all living together, so I start seeing the students from other 7:30 in the morning, and we're often together till 10:30 at night. So there's lots of opportunities to discuss these things. And this was the situation changes from the morning into the evening. It’s good.Michael: So we have three of your papers that we can get into here. Let's do that, shall we?Andy: Sure.Michael: The first, just in chronological order — as it seems to take seems to make sense to tackle them in that way — is “Mathematical models for emerging disease,” which you wrote for Science Magazine. This is related to a question that people have been bringing up on social media and I want to give some time in this conversation to those questions as well. So it seems right to start with a question you start this article with, which is, “What are the limits of mathematical models in the in tracking, understanding and extracting insights on emerging disease?” Let’s start as you do, with the problem of the problem.Andy: I mean, that is the key question. And we're actually seeing that being really tested, as we follow the news at the moment. I think there's sort of two sides to the answer. One is that the models provide the most powerful macroscope we have of trying to understand disease patterns at large scales. And to make any form of projection of cases and any response to possible treatments, you need those models. Now, the other end of that is how much detail do you need before you can make valid projections or provide useful policy insights? And what quality of data have we got to parameterize those more? In a way, the projections are strange. And so the Chinese have been very good about providing access to the information they're collecting. The Italians are also being very good about that. Though getting this information out when people are literally trying to stop people dying is very, very hard. You don't want people wandering around with a clipboard trying to write everything down. Plainly, the good thing is we have mathematical frameworks that we've used before for Ebola, and that we use all the time for the measles and influenza. So the key parts of the model structure are there. It’s also applied to humans so lots of the human demography is there for different types of countries. But it's like saying, “What is different about this virus?” That means that the structure of those models have to be modified to take that into consideration. And then the second sort of unknown is, “How do we model social interactions between people of different ages? And how much detail of that do we have to capture before it's radically changed by different interventions?”Michael: When we had you on the podcast for the first time, you talked about the way that different interactions, different network structures, can create these sort of reservoirs. Something that's been on my mind that I brought up with Laurent [Hébert-Dufresne] yesterday is that we've been looking at this in terms of just the number of sizes of congregations, but there's also different network structures, different degrees of clustering within congregations of different sizes. So I'm curious how you understand that, not just different sizes of groups of people, but different kinds of groups.Andy: Again, like you said, just different contact network architectures might play into the spread of this. That gets to the crux of what we just taught: that lots of the models we have are parameterized assuming normal behavior. Children go into school, grown ups go into work, some sick people being in hospitals, people mixing at home and occasionally seeing their grandparents, and very much forced by the opening and closing of the school semesters where the mixing patterns change. And that is constantly kicking a system that's inherently nonlinear, but giving it a kick two or three times a year depending on how the school system works. That all disappears as we move into the thing that now everybody is to stay at home in much smaller clusters, which will have the age of whatever the family is or whether people decide to go home with their parents or whether to isolate in different age classes, like the elderly people by themselves, perhaps in bigger aggregations in senior homes, older couples and middle-aged couples, and then children isolating themselves from their parents. We need to know how to capture that. And what proportion of people that are in each of those categories, and how do they mix? One big advantage we have now that we haven't had before, is the people who've been looking at social mixing based on cellphone data can provide really rapid ways of parameterizing. And it's a question of, well, “What proportion of people are on Facebook? What proportion are on WhatsApp? What proportion are on the next latest thing? And can you aggregate that data in a way that tells you something meaningful about social interactions?”Michael: I'm afraid as you say in your your email signature, PJ Plauger: “My definition of an expert in any field is a person who knows enough about what's really going on to be scared.” While I think it's important that, speaking for SFI, we don't seem as certain about anything but there, it's good to point out where the gaps are in our understanding. One of the things that you say towards the end of this paper, which I think broadly applies to complex phenomena, is that emergence and prediction have this asymmetrical, complex relationship to each other. And that we're often in a position where it seems like we expect people to be able to bring to bear electronic surveillance and complex mathematical models into some kind of control room scenario. But we're dealing with something that we don't understand and in many respects the emergent behaviors of this are only going to be clear in retrospect, right?Andy: That's totally true. I mean, most of the time, we are looking at epidemic data after the epidemics happen, and building up a knowledge of that. One of the things that makes me optimistic is there's been a huge expansion in this area. Back in the late 80s, early 90s, the whole area took off when HIV appeared. And lots of the methods and incentive to do this work came from people desperately trying to understand HIV as it was happening live as an epidemic. HIV operates on a slower timescale. Although transmission can occur fast, a couple of days, people are alive for up to a decade while still infectious. Here, everything is happening much faster. But as I say, lots of the tools we've developed them for social mixing and understanding age structured or socially structured epidemics come from all that work. It also attracted lots of bright young people in the field to study it. So there are a significant number of people out there all interacting with each other, to try and find ways to deal with this. That makes me optimistic.Michael: You mentioned here in the in the gap between understanding what a particular genome does in well-studied lab models, and then what it might do in the wild. One of the approaches that might help us understand this is actually drawn from ecology, predicting sudden changes of state in lakes and other ecosystems, like looking at how times series data give us an understanding into phase transitions. I'd love to hear you expand on that.Andy: We’re certainly seeing that with the money markets at the moment. The the prediction that a huge increase in variance is suggesting something is changing to a different state…we’ve seen that on an hourly basis.Michael: How do you see epidemiologists using that kind of an insight to model thresholds in the pandemic?Andy: Well, most pandemics, there's one critical threshold and that's that basic reproductive number of the pathogen, or R0. When does an infected individual infect more than one person? Then you've got the epidemic taking off. Control is working out how do we change behavior, intervene to prevent, to get that number below one. So there's really only one main threshold. You can then look at that at different scales. How does it move from house to house? Or how does it move from village to village, town to town, country to country? And we've seen a sort of series of R0s of this thing taking off. So that's the main threshold, that we're concerned about with epidemic behavior. The interesting thing we want to know now about that is, is there any geographical signal to that? It looks to some of us that as you move away from the equator, that number of people that an infected person is transmitting to seems to be getting bigger. We're also seeing that the time course of the epidemic, the trajectory seems slower in some warmer countries than in colder countries. Now, we don't know if that's purely because if you're up in Scandinavia, you're still spending a lot of time indoors in close contact with people, whereas if you're in parts of Africa or Southeast Asia, you're outside and not as close proximity and not breathing the same air. The other coronaviruses do seem to have a very strong seasonal signal, in that they disappear over the warmer months or longer days, and then come back again in the fall. So will you see that sort of pattern as this epidemic develops, offset against the fact that nearly everybody is susceptible? You're gonna have less of a chance of seeing that in a population when nearly everybody is susceptible than you will in a population where there's levels of immunity that buffer the epidemic, and so it's looking for opportunities to spread.Michael: So this seems like it dovetails into the next paper that you sent me to discuss here, which is “The evolution of pathogen virulence across space during an epidemic.” We'll link to this in the show notes. This was for American Naturalist and it’s really interesting, in that it regards different waves of the same pathogen as it evolves and as the virulence changes over time. Can you unpack this a little bit, please?Andy: Yeah. I mean, I'm sure it's only a matter of weeks before we get people wildly speculating about, “Is the pathogen going to evolve to get more aggressive, or will it evolve to become benign?” Lots of people have been interested in the evolution of virulence, going right back to the sort of classic studies of Frank Fenner who was one of the people responsible for helping eradicate smallpox. Frank was also interested in the myxoma virus, myxomatosis in rabbits, because myxoma was used to control rabbits in Australia. When they first introduced it, they introduced the most virulent strain they could find. It killed like 99.8% of the rabbits. But quite quickly through time, it evolved to much lower levels of virulence. And then people—particularly Roy Anderson, and a bunch of other people, looked at ways of modeling that and found that that's the type of evolution of virulence you would see if there's a strong tradeoff between transmission efficiency and expression of virulence. Essentially, if you kill the host faster, it's not going to be around for long enough to transmit the disease. So the more virulent you get, the more the ability to transmit goes down because you're not infectious for so long. And what seemed to be selected for with myxoma in rabbits was a reduction in variance because it made more hosts get infected. The number of hosts you infect is the sort of evolutionary fitness of the virus. Now, what's different about coronavirus and this bacteria we've been studying in the finches—and those finches are in nearly everybody's backyard across the US—is the evolution of virulence in a system where transmission occurs before virulence is expressed. So that reduces the potential for there to be a tradeoff between virulence and transmission. And if you think back to the early days of this coronavirus, one of the big things we were worried about is, “How long are people infectious before they show symptoms?” And people that were still very focused on that and how different that might be from location to location. This is a system we've been able to monitor since it emerged in 1983 and jumped from domestic poultry into wild birds, mainly how finches and spread up and down the East Coast of the US, and then right across the Great Plains into California down into the southeast and deserts. And then it's become endemic everywhere. Now, again, it's similar to coronavirus in that transmission occurs for about a week before symptoms appear and when symptoms appear, the efficiency of transmission goes down. And when we make mathematical medical models of that, it creates the potential for virulence to increase as it becomes more endemic because there's no tradeoff between transmission and virulence, or a much weaker trade off between those two. And there’s an additional twist there, which is the thing that sort of disconcerted me about say UK’s initial policy of “Let's just let herd immunity build up, let's get everybody infected, and then we'll have herd immunity but we'll bring it down.” But if it operates in a similar way to this bacterial thing, that having everybody immune selects strains that will produce greater immunity. And if that greater immunity is associated with more virulence, then you'll start selecting for more virulent strains. It’s potentially equally possible that strains that are more immunogenic produce less virulent strains, though the mechanism of that will be more torturous to derive than for them to be more.Michael: That touches on the other piece, “Incomplete host immunity favors the evolution of virulence of an emergent pathogen.”Andy: Right. And as far as we know, the little data we have on immunity to coronaviruses is that it's not like measles. It’s not immunity for life—maybe two or three years. But then, interestingly, if you get re-exposed it could be that you don't transmit, and you don't show as bad but you top your immunity up. Which would be good on one hand, and that would keep levels of herd immunity up and protect other people and the transmission efficiency would go down. But that potentially creates that scenario that once it's endemic, you start selecting for the virulence or the transmissibility to evolve in different ways.Michael: So, this piece, looking at the short term dynamics of emergence of more virulent strains. You talk about less virulent strains dominating the periphery of an epidemic, and more virulent strains emerging and and catching up to them. What does that look like with an outbreak pattern, like the outbreak patterns that we see now? International air travel is very nonlinear, it's not like the Western Front in World War One. It's this mess, just all over the planet. So what are we really talking about in light of that kind of complex transmission pattern?Andy: Well, you know that that's an interesting question. Certainly it's important to differentiate between what's going on in the early stages of an epidemic when everybody is susceptible and the disease is jumping from groups of infected to new groups of susceptibles. That is suddenly massively facilitated by airline travel, which seems to be hugely reduced in the course of this week. By definition, the finches have their own form of airline travel: they fly around. So when we first saw it emerge, it goes up and down for the flight waves on the East Coast, and then spreads just like birds, drifting into new territories. So it spreads at a much slower rate. As all airline travel is reduced in the US and around the world, and people start using other forms of transportation, people driving out west to get to their homes out there, then they may be spreading it but a much lower rate than the airline. Plus, you know, the slowness of travel operates in some ways as a barrier. We go back to the discussion we had [in Episode 16] about rinderpest. Rinderpest couldn't get into Sub-Saharan Africa until after the invention of steam ships, because then you could move cattle in less than the incubation time of the pathogen to get them into Sub-Saharan Africa. If you put them on sailing ships, they would die on board, you kill the rest of the cattle and the disease wouldn't be introduced.Michael: One of the questions from social media is, what other kind of spatial models do you think are are useful in understanding this kind of thing?Andy: Well, that's an interesting question. I mean, everybody thinks their model is the most important. And there will be vociferous proponents of each, people who work in the different areas. The network people will say, “This is the most important part.” But as we said earlier, all these networks are going to have to change dramatically. So that will create the stimulus for people to develop models through a network whose framework is changing incredibly rapidly. That will be important to understand. Again, I think we are going to revert to a situation where we are thinking about sort of meta-population models at different scales: what happens in each individual household, and how strongly and weakly are those households connected, and how are collections of households in one area connected to other towns, and what is the meta-population structure of New York City? Is it is each tower block is a particular sub-population like cruise ships turned up vertically, and they will jump from “cruise ship” to “cruise ship” or tower block to tower block? It’s crucial to know locations where transmission is occurring that couples different points in the network together. Now, is it delivery drivers? Is it people sneaking out for anonymous assignations? We noticed with foot-and-mouth in the UK, the trend was to isolate all the farms and perhaps the plots surrounding them. But often it was things like the beds moving between farms, or a pair of boots, that would move it around. And sometimes it was farmers meeting other farmers’ wives or even other farmers that was moving the disease around. It was embarrassing outbreaks that could only be explained in one or two different ways.Michael: I was speaking with Laurent, about this. He and Sam Scarpino and a couple others have been working on the way that this stacks and interacts with contagions of information. There's a reasonable argument for mapping this in terms of populations that abide by different kinds of behavior. Like there's a sort of virtual layer to this. That it's it's not just about spatial coordination, but also about memetic transfer and the way that people's behaviors are governed by their beliefs about what kind of practices to adopt.Andy: That is always going to be an interesting signature, that people's different cultural behaviors will have a huge effect on the way that these pathogens move. Particularly with something that requires quite a physical proximity to move them around, how people's social systems are structured by age, coupled on top of that spatial distribution, and whether they all meet once a week to aggregate in a church or something…that’s a very powerful mechanism for speeding up an epidemic. Solitary hermits are usually pretty healthy because they're not interacting with each other.Michael: A question on a lot of people's minds is related to the statement you made in that first paper about not being able to understand these things except in hindsight. When we had you on the podcast the first time, we spent a lot of time on the issue of the interplay between epidemics and economics, and the way that susceptibility to disease can help lock people into poverty,  create these these stable patterns within the global economic system that makes it difficult for us to lift people into a state of economic health. I'd be curious to know how you're thinking about this, in light of the anxiety a lot of people are understandably feeling about the economic impacts of the social isolation and not knowing where the line is…especially with our testing being as incomplete as it is. Maybe that’s two questions.Andy: Well, I mean, this is a sort of an alternate form of virulence in in some ways, that having to suddenly close, all sort of social sites where people meet socially—bars, restaurants, hotels—closing all that down has a huge knock-on effect. It should slow down transmission, but suddenly all those people don't have jobs. They're relying on money coming in week to week. How can you supply funds so they can feed themselves and convince them to stay isolated for the relatively—I don't want to use the word “prolonged”—but the length of time they're going to have to be isolated. That money will eventually allow them to go back to some sort of jobs and probably the ones they had before. But the stress they're going to get, well, that is going to be deeply disturbing for lots of people. It's a thing we talked about two months ago [on the podcast], that there are lots of people who live in Africa in the US, South America, in poverty, and that increases their susceptibility to disease. But here we have the situation that people who thought they had stable jobs, that were bringing in a weekly wage, suddenly become much more susceptible to this because once that wage disappears, that puts all sorts of additional stresses on their life, which might increase their contact people and increase their susceptibility to this. So it's not gonna be an easy problem to deal with.Michael: It seems like epidemiological thinking might help us model better market forecasts and maybe better strategies for recovering from this situation when things start to die down. If they start to die down.Andy: Well, certainly, you've got to integrate epidemiological thinking into how you're going to get the economy started again. What are ways to start up so people can fly, on attested non-infectious airlines that have a certificate showing they're not infected, that's a valid certificate. Or having people getting the sort of banking economy and the wreck that is the whole service industry of restaurants, bars, hotels…getting that going again, because it's on the order of 5% to 8% of the US workforce. So you've got to get those people going again. The good thing is that there's an industry of people working on models for this disease, so tons of those insights will be available. There will be heated discussions about which models are right, but there are enough mechanisms to test them and try them out without actually having to do the experiment of mixing people together to see which one worked and which one doesn't. And then to pull back if anything starts to go wrong. Again, this is going to be interesting, as China now mentally thinks it’s through the worst of this and starts putting its workforce back, the levels of herd immunity…even though somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000 people have been infected in China, you really have to get about 50% of the population infected and recovered before you're going to have any herd immunity that's going to slow down future outbreaks. And 100,000 out of a billion is a tiny percentage.Michael: So what do you suppose the odds are that this is going to remain endemic? What happens if this just becomes a seasonal illness?Andy: If you take that portion of people who have been infected in China and subtract it from one, that that's the probability that this is going to become endemic. We’re going to have to find a way to deal with it as an additional form of seasonal flu and hope that we do it in a way that doesn't select for it to become more virulent. I think the first vaccine trials were started in Seattle yesterday, and I think in China today. We need to switch around quite a lot of manufacturing ability for vaccines to get a vaccine broadly available. Even if we had one tomorrow, to have it broadly available would still take about a year. Once it's endemic, it's likely you'll only have to vaccinate people after a certain age, as well as sensibly just vaccinating them when they're at high school or junior school to get herd immunity.Michael: What are some of the most potent and useful resources that you might suggest to people right now if they want to learn more about this, or just want to stay on on top of things?Andy: There are a very good online courses on infectious disease. Penn State has an excellent one that's got a very good group of people explaining that the biology and mathematics of epidemic diseases. And there's a whole host of literature out there, like the Anderson & May book I mentioned on The Infectious Diseases of Humans. It came out in 1990 and is still the Old and New Testament on this, if you like, and it leads you down the right structure for a whole variety of different types of diseases. And there are some very good people to follow on Twitter, and it’s well worth doing that. Jeremy Fox From the Wellcome Trust, good advice. Marc Lipsitch for the Harvard School of Public Health has been providing excellent advice. So the people that they seem to be Eddie Holmes from University of Sydney has been provided great stuff on the genetics of this and how that's all happening. Following them and the people they seem most connected to is going to provide us with what I think is really solid scientific input on a day-to-day basis.Michael: Excellent. Andy, thanks again for taking some time to talk with us.Andy: Hopefully we can get a beer together once this is over.Michael: That would be great.Andy: Good! Say hi to everybody for me.Michael: I will. Stay safe out there.
23,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Laurent, it is a pleasure to have you here on Complexity—in spite of the fact that you're on the show because we're in a pandemic. It's one of those mixed blessings that you get to step forward and speak with some expertise and authority here. This is our first remote recording, listeners, and it's appropriate to the social isolation, but there might be some latency issues in the recording for which we apologize. You've been looking at epidemic transmission, social reinforcement, contagion networks, and so on for years. You've given us a couple papers to look at. I'm not sure whether this is the right place to start, but let's start here. You did a paper with Sam Scarpino and Antoine Allard, “The Effect of a Prudent Adaptive Behavior on Disease Transmission,” from November 2016. That seems like the simplest place to start. Why don't you talk a little bit about the gross outline of this paper?Laurent: Right. So this paper started during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, in 2014. If you remember, back then, the news was much more focused on how different the Western African societies were than our own. There were a lot of conversations and new stories about traditional burial practice in West Africa and how that contributed to the spread of Ebola: funeral practices that involve touching the body a lot and that, of course, would spread Ebola, and those people are obviously going to be at risk. That's one of the first insights of network science and epidemiology is that you have individuals with just a lot more social connections, whether that's school teachers or funeral workers in West Africa, and those are going to be high risk individuals. If the disease is going to reach someone first, it's probably going to be them. They have so many connections.Now, healthcare workers and funeral workers are in this weird position where they're really at risk, but they're also essential. If a funeral worker gets sick from Ebola because of their job, chances are they get sick, they stay home for the next few days, someone else is going to take care of the funerals. We're replacing high risk individuals with new healthy individuals.The same thing happens in any outbreak, really. It's just we can't afford ... Right now, we're talking about the capacity of our healthcare system. If nurses and doctors who are at risk get sick, we’ve got to bring other people in, we’ve got to ask other people to put themselves at higher risk. It's the idea that you have those high risk essential individuals that you keep replacing, and it seems like a good idea because you want to treat people and you want to take care of the burials, but that can accelerate the spread of the disease because you have this turnover of hubs in your social network.Michael: Talk a little bit about the model that you created for this, and then you compared it to empirical evidence from a number of different outbreaks.Laurent: The model is fairly simple. We use the standard network models for disease transmission, which is simply you track individuals based on their current state, whether they're healthy, infectious, or dead or recovered, but you also track interaction: how many interactions occur between healthy people or one healthy person and one infectious individual, and just having this netrwork perspective just gives you the opportunity to model a social mechanism. In our case, it's the idea that people don't like being in contact with infectious individuals. The classic example I always give in talks is you go to the butcher to buy a steak for dinner, and you see the person behind the counter sneezing all over the meat. You're just going to eat something else that day. You're just rewiring that potential edge that you had with the butcher to whoever, the cheese maker because you're going to buy cheese instead.Having a network perspective allows us to account for local rewiring mechanisms that we all do, like that social distancing. That's us cutting links. It's all very local network mechanisms. We had a simple model of that with the idea that some connections have to be preserved because they're essential. If my nurse gets sick, I'm just going to get rewired to a different nurse that's healthy, and now that nurse is being put at risk. That was a simple model, and it gave us this idea of super exponential spread. The classic picture is I infect two people, they each infect two people, these four infect two people, to get this exponential transmission tree for a disease. With this mechanism, because you keep re-feeding new, highly connected, high risk individuals into your population, it can get this super exponential spread, so faster than exponential.We got the theoretical results, and we're like, "Well, has there ever been a disease where we think that there is a faster than exponential spread?" It turns out if you go in almost any flu seasons in the U.S. in almost any state, you're going to get this regime just before the peak of accelerating spread. That can be social patterns, what I'm describing now. It could be related to weather. The flu virus likes dry weather. That could be driving that. It could be it's flu season, we think about it more, we go to the doctor more. It could be a lot of things, but it seems like one of the most potent drivers of disease dynamics has always been social mechanisms and social behavior. So it seems likely, at least, that this could be one of them: this idea that when we think we're being prudent sometimes we make things worse for the collective by having a locally prudent behavior.Michael: There are some implications that you discuss in this paper, and I'm curious how you see these results fitting in with COVID-19 and how we can make sense of this because, obviously, one of the issues is that it's a lot more difficult to identify who has been infected, that there's a latency with symptoms. How does that complicate this situation?Laurent: Well, when we published that paper in 2016, we got some media attention, not all of which understood the subtlety of the model and of the results, I guess. There were a few headlines that read, "Don't Stay Home Sick," as if we were arguing against people staying home when they're sick. Of course, that's not the message. The message is stay home sick, and if your job needs someone to take over, then they should take some preventive measures. Right now, with coronavirus, the idea is if you are sick, absolutely stay home sick. If you can do your job remotely, do that. If you can't, or maybe your job can go without an employee for awhile, if you have to bring someone in, it seems like it's probably a high risk job because you got sick, and so that person should take additional measures to prevent their infection.The idea is just, if the teacher gets sick, we're going to bring a substitute in if the school is still open, but that substitute should be aware that the virus might be going around the school, and, therefore, the way they teach and just the way they interact with people should change accordingly, which is just something we're not used to doing in normal seasonal flu outbreaks.Michael: There is another fold in this. I want to talk about “Beyond R0: the importance of contact tracing when predicting epidemics,” this other paper that you did with Benjamin Althouse, Sam Scarpino, and Antoine Allard. One of the problems that we're in now is, because of this latency, it's been extremely difficult to trace the contact network.Laurent: Right.Michael: Nonetheless, I think it's worth getting a little bit into the details. Talk a little bit, for those unfamiliar with this term, although I'm sure it's getting a lot more widely known, what is R0? How do we measure that? And then why is R0 not enough? Where did this paper fill in an important gap in trying to think about tracing epidemics with that value alone?Laurent: R0 or “R naught” is the basic reproduction number of a disease. The best definition is the simplest one. It's essentially the average or expected number of cases that you're going to create if you get infected early in an outbreak. If R naught is two, that means that if I get infected early in an outbreak, you can expect that I'll infect, on average, two people. That's a powerful number because, obviously, if that number is below one for every new case that you get, you expect less than one more case, so you don't even get a chain of transmission. That means that you'd expect a disease to die out quickly. If it's above one, you get branching trees of transmission, and then you'd expect it to grow and to get an outbreak.It's a powerful number because it gives you, in one number, sort of an aggregated metric for both how transmissible the disease is, how dense the population is, the behavior that people are putting into place, the intervention that is being put in place, and all the complexity of disease dynamics and epidemics are put in one number, which at least below one, above one gives us a quantitative idea of how transmissible it might be. It's really popular because of that. It's one number, so it's tempting to try and use it to compare different outbreaks.The classic example is the movie Contagion, which has that five-minute scene of them trying to figure out that one number. But it doesn't tell you the whole picture. There, my favorite example is the 1918 influenza epidemic and, again, the Western Africa Ebola epidemic of 2014/2016. Our best estimates for R naught in both cases are around 1.5, meaning that everyone that gets it, you transmit to one person, maybe two, but really the distributions are much more complex than that. For flu, maybe it's true that it was maybe one, maybe two, maybe three, average of 1.5. For Ebola, it's much more likely that you infect no one…and then, like I said, you have some super spreading events, like funerals, that end up infecting dozens of individuals. You can have the same average, but a very, very different underlying distribution. The reason why the average doesn't describe that distribution well is because whether you have this fat-tailed distribution or your average is driven by super spreading events will dictate how robust your epidemic is to intervention and to just stochastic chance. If an epidemic is driven not by the average individual, but by super spreading events, then an intervention that cuts an outbreak before you reach one of these events will be super effective. It's much harder to intervene against diseases that spread very steadily. Everyone infects two people: that’s way harder to fight against.Michael: One of the points in this paper is about how little we actually know about secondary infections with the 2019 novel coronavirus. What insights does this paper offer in terms of how to address outbreaks when we have such a profound unknown—when the uncertainty in outbreak size is modeled everywhere from, you say, 5-40% of susceptible individuals?Laurent: Well, that's the very tricky question, and that's why I guess I ignored part two of your previous question. It's very hard to measure the basic reproduction number because, most diseases, we don't have a clear idea of who infects whom. We have something like that for hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola, where people will put into place a contact tracing protocol. So contact tracing is in the title, and it's this idea that when someone shows up sick at a treatment center or at a hospital, you might want to stay ahead of the disease. If you have the resources, you go to their workplace, you go to their home, and you test people for early symptoms, and then you might be able to stay ahead of the disease and catch cases early. If you do that, you also get the great benefit of treating them well, but also getting the data of who infected whom and have an idea of this secondary number, this number of secondary infections or of R0. So for Ebola, we have some contact tracing data and we do it well, but it's hard to do in real time. It's often during chaotic outbreaks and we often don't have the resources to do that. The data that comes there is noisy and hard to play with, but it's incredibly valuable. For respiratory infections, it's almost impossible. You get the flu, maybe it’s from someone on the bus, maybe someone at work, someone that touches the same door handle 10 minutes ago. It's just much more tricky.And then we rely on a lot of simulations. So we look at the time series and how much noise we see in the time series of cases. We simulate, to the best of our abilities, diseases with different distribution of secondary infections and we try to get a posterior estimate for what these distributions might look like. So we have different ways. There's also a way through, if we have an idea about the mutation rate and if we see sequence of virus enough, we might have good ideas about who infected whom. So there are different ways to get to it, but none of them are super reliable early in an outbreak, which is one reason why the classic models that only use one number to parameterize everything about an epidemic are still successful because we still struggle to go beyond that, even if…obviously, my paper is saying we should and people have been saying that for decades, but it's just very, very, very hard.Michael: That seems like it tails us into another paper that you coauthored on “School Closures, Event Cancellations, and the Mesoscopic Localization of Epidemics and Networks With Higher Order Structure.”Laurent: I love that title so much! Because the title was meant to reflect sort of that's sometimes very technical results like the mesoscopic localization of epidemics in higher order networks can inform us on why and how useful it is to do very concrete things like close school and cancel events. So that's why I love the title.Michael: Yeah. So, as you've already mentioned, one of the main challenges here is—as you and your co-authors put it—the failures of the surveillance system in this particular case. We’re pretty deep into the outbreak already. I want to spend a little bit more time in a moment on some of the questions that have been coming up from folks in our social media audience…one of those questions was about, how do we know from the models how containment strategies at different scales work? When is this about the distance that you're taking from another person? When is it about a school or event closure? When is about border crossings and closing those? How do we understand how those different skills relate to one another? How did you model this and this in this particular paper?Laurent: Oh, this is such a good question. So I won't get into the model right away. I want to first answer what do we know about the different scales and why I felt like we needed this mesoscopic scale. So when I say mesoscopic, the idea is that microscopic is the individual, so that's me choosing to avoid a friend for a night. Mesoscopic is anything that involves multiple individuals, so that's school closures or events. And then the macroscopic would be mass quarantines at the country level. So let's say from the top down, I think we know from history that mass quarantines don't work or at least they don't work well, especially late in an outbreak. People find a way to avoid them. People need to travel and it's easier to make it easy for people to travel but actually test them and track them as they do. So I checked my visa status and requirements recently because I've been asked to comment about some of the decisions in the intervention from the U.S. and apparently I'm allowed to criticize my host country. I'm Canadian.But that's why the intervention has been shit: because it's focused a little bit too much on the macro scale and hasn't given much guideline to what I think in this outbreak is the critical scale, which is the meso scale. So I've been organizing conferences and it's up to me at the end to decide whether I cancel my conferences or not. It was up to SFI to decide whether to shut down or not. And some places can't make those decisions because they have to weigh the collective good when facing the outbreak with the fact that their business maybe can't afford to close down for a month or two. And that's not a decision that anyone should be asked to make, really to choose between their own business and livelihood or the health of their community.And we don't have enough information or even knowledge really at the individual level to make those decisions. So the intervention has been messy in that regard I think, and then the kind of information that we would need is also not available. So a lot of people, we cancel a conference and we get emails from speakers who are like, "Oh, I think you're overreacting." At the time of the cancellation there were only nine cases in Quebec, which is where I'm from, and while that's true, there's a lot that goes into that. I'm sure other people who will be talking too will bring up the fact that this is an exponential curve. So when you're early on, you don't want to use the number at T = 0 to try and predict what is going to be in two months, because it's an exponential spread and might be gigantic.But also it's not true that those cases are uniformly distributed in the population. We tend to think of, “Oh, it's nine cases, every person has nine over n chances of being infected in this population,” which is just not the case. Some people are more at risk. That's what network epidemiology has been telling us for decades and some structures are more at risk, and that's why the meso scale is really important. So you're much more likely to find cases in schools or hospitals or big events just because that's where most of the social connections are out there, and therefore that's where most of the infections are going to occur. So if the disease lives at this meso scale, which not all diseases do, but some do, and I think this might be the case for Coronavirus, our intervention is much more powerful if it operates on that same scale.And what it does mean is that you, by closing a school, you delete, you remove, a lot of those social connections that might spread the disease, but you also reduce the coupling across different schools that might still be open or across other structures. So it's really like an intervention that works in two ways by both protecting the individuals in that school, but also reducing the overall mesoscopic spread of the outbreak. So that's what it means, really. The important thing is try and think about, what are the key mechanisms for the spread of this disease? And individual interventions are super useful, washing your hands, social distancing, but you can spread to someone very inadvertently by just touching something you didn't even realized you touched and 10 minutes later they touch the same surface, touch their face. So unless you do it extremely well, those microscopic interventions are not going to be super efficient.They'll work well for sexually transmitted infections, not so well for something as unknown. You don't even know if you're infected. We don't clearly know that the mechanisms with Coronavirus. So, in that case, mesoscopic works much better in my opinion. So that's how I'd try and think about it.Michael: And so, in the model, this is just about pruning at different levels. I guess the question that I see coming up from people is why 500 people going to a church service is the number that people are picking. It seems to a lay person relatively arbitrary, but you talk about the efficacy of interventions at different levels. So, yeah, maybe a little bit more detail about how you actually model these interventions, and how it is that you and other epidemiologists are coming to these numbers and making these specific suggestions?Laurent: Right. Yeah, so when we wrote the paper, I remember friends had a ban on all gatherings of above 1000 people. California at another number, maybe 5500, and now my university, University of Vermont, we can still have seminars on campus, but nothing with a crowd of more than 25 people. So the question is, how do you pick 25? How do you pick 1000? I think we have a good idea of just broad distribution. So we know those distributions are heterogeneous. We know there's hockey games in Montreal. That's what, 21,000 people? There's not that many big events that occur weekly in Quebec and there are a lot of events with 50 people. We know how many classes occur and all that. So we have an idea that those distributions are very heterogeneous, and we have an idea of how heterogeneous they are. Similarly, we have an idea of how many social groups and events a given individual will participate in.So we have broad ways to parameterize these types of networks that are created not by simple pairwise interactions but really by higher order structure events and groups and classes. And once you have that, you can calculate the coupling between different structures. So if I start an outbreak in this hospital, maybe it's going to stay in the hospital. But if the coupling is strong enough, maybe it's going to be able to jump to other hospitals or schools. So then the idea is, how much do I have to play with this distributions of participants per event to decrease the coupling? It's almost like bringing the reproduction number down below one, not on the individual level but at the level of events and structures. So it's just a coupling that you decrease by making A less and less big event and eventually you get this critical threshold, which is one in the case of R0, something else in the case of this mesoscopic transmission. But then you stop the spread at the mesoscopic level. And that's where those interventions can be super beneficial.And actually you end up cutting less social interactions by doing it at that level than if you were just randomly cutting pairwise interactions or social interactions through social distancing. So it is a powerful metric, but it is very hard to calculate or to estimate the critical size that you need because it's specific to different populations. We still don't know just how transmissible the virus even is. So it is tricky. In the paper, 27…but that's for one set of parameters and a bunch of assumptions. But the idea is that you want to be safe, so this idea of 1000 might be too much. That's already a really big event and 25 might be too low because then it's hard to operate. Not everything can move online. So in my mind it's this intermediate thing of numbers like 50 and 100 sort of make sense, they're in the right ballpark. 25 is very safe. 1000 is too much. It's hard to explain what it is, but we have a good understanding of what they should be.And of course, the safer we are now, the better it's going to be in the long run. And my new philosophy is that almost no event is really critical. Nothing is that important. I could cancel my class right now. My students might miss some of my good jokes and a little bit of good material, but it's not that important. At the end of the day, it's not that critical. So canceling events is really not that big of a deal.Michael: So there's another fold to this, which you talk about your 2015 paper in PNAS with Ben Althouse, “Complex Dynamics of Synergistic Co-Infections on Realistically Clustered Networks.” And I think it's important to stress that Coronavirus isn't happening in isolation here and that for a lot of people, this has been a particularly vicious flu season. In my own family we're coming off of three weeks of head colds just in time for campus closure. All of this.Laurent: Right!Michael: You've done some research into how modeling networks of different structures changes our expectations when we're looking at diseases, not in isolation, but in co-infected individuals. I'd love to hear you talk a little bit more about that.Laurent: Yeah, this is an interesting line of work because we often or almost always model disease in a vacuum. If you look at any models, it's rare that they're going to take more than one disease into account. And yet we know that those things interact, right? The classic examples are more sexually transmitted infection, so if you have syphilis and HIV, your transmission rate of HIV goes up by maybe a factor of 40, right? Syphilis gives you surface wounds which are going to just create more bodily fluid exchange and you're going to transmit HIV a lot more than you would if you only had HIV and not syphilis.We know that for some diseases it's incredibly important to take interactions into account. Interactions can be mechanistic, like the one I just described. It could just be that you have the flu. It makes you weaker. It makes your immune system weaker and then you get colonized by pneumonia or something else. That's almost an indirect interaction, but it can also be just you declare a state of emergency to fight Ebola in Congo. Well then you're sending resources to fight Ebola and those resources, whether it's healthcare workers, or hospital beds, or actual dollars, they have to come from somewhere else. They often come from somewhere else in public health interventions. That's why Congo is now seeing more deaths because of malaria or cholera than they did before Ebola. That's an indirect interaction that goes through political and social systems.We know those things: they all interact in one way or another. We were just curious about how different would those models be? Of course they become very hard to track because you need to keep track of my state regarding flu, my state regarding pneumonia, my state regarding something else. The number of variables and mechanisms just blows up. It is harder, but it's doable. When you do it well, you realize that they also have completely different dynamical patterns. The big one for me that was a big surprise back then, I guess in 2015 I think, was the fact that classic models almost always give us this monotonous relationship between the expected epidemic size, so how many people are going to get sick, and the transmission rate or R0 of a disease. If R0 is below one, nothing happens. When R0 goes above one, there's this monotonous relationship: the larger it is, the bigger the outbreak.When disease interact, it's not quite like that because the idea is maybe Syphilis can spread alone and HIV can't. Then if Syphilis just gets a little stronger, then you can get this discontinuous jump where you go from almost no HIV epidemic to huge HIV epidemic. I don't want to use HIV and Syphilis as an example too much because I don't know that much about sexually transmitted infections, but the idea is that when things interact, you can get this latent heat where one disease would be like, "I would really blow up. If you spread a little more I'll blow up." The other one could say the same thing, so if one of them gets a random mutation, just gets a little more transmissible, then they both blow up. Right? You get these discontinuous jumps in epidemic size, which are just unheard of in classic models.We know that dynamics can be very different. The super exponential spread that we get with some social behavior we can get as well with interacting diseases so that the range of possible behavior is just incredible. It means that if we want to do robust forecasts, we need to take more than one thing into account and we can't model them in a vacuum, really. I've been talking about different diseases, but what the coronavirus outbreak is showing us is that those contagions can also, or maybe more easily, be social and not so much other infectious diseases, right? You get spread of news information of social media…that's going to help coronavirus spread. If you want to get a good model to forecast the spread of coronavirus or to forecast the effectiveness of interventions, you have to take those contagions of misinformation into account because they're just as critical to the public health questions you're trying to ask as the virus itself.Michael: I do want to get to the work that you've done on informational contagions in relation to biological contagions, but first I want to explore this just a little bit more because one of the questions that came up in the Facebook group was about how this relates to the paper we were just discussing a moment ago. We know that it's not just the size of the events, but it's the network structure within them. When we're talking about limiting events to, say, 50 to 100, but some of those events are school closures, some of them are sporting events and the contact networks in those different kinds of events look different.Laurent: Right.Michael: Could you talk a little bit more about specifically how randomizing a network affects the spread of co-infections and then what that means for people who might have to make difficult choices about the priority of events of similar sizes and how those events actually are structured?Laurent: Right. When you have multiple things that are spreading on a network, but interact together in a synergistic way, so news information and coronavirus, or syphilis and HIV, they help each other spread. Well, these synergistic contagions, as I like to call them, also benefit from this mesoscopic clustering of many people being part of the same structure. That's also a little surprising because the classic models tell us that clustering your social connections, social isolation, is great, right? If the disease spread from me, to my sister and my mom, then it can go from my mom to my sister. There's a triangle, so that triangles ends up being a wasted link for the disease. Clustering of connections is good in classic models.For synergistic interactions, not so much. The diseases or the different contagions like to be kept together, right? They want to be kept together because these spread better if they're together. Then having these dense groups actually help their spread and makes those group a hotspot for the spread of contagions. That's just another way that the dynamics of interacting contagions is just very different from classic models. They interact differently with the mesoscopic scale. I think if we went back to that paper where we use a really simple model to show this phenomenon of mesoscopic localization, if we did it with some form of interacting contagions that that benefit from mesoscopic clustering, I think the results would be even stronger and would make even a better case for closing certain structures.The problem is we don't have good data about co-infection almost ever, right? For privacy reasons, you don't share the identity of the cases. So when we do studies on flu, we have flu incidence data. When we do a study for coronavirus with coronavirus incidence data. We rarely know who had both. The one thing we know for coronavirus now is that it seems like most cases of deaths are due to people with preexisting conditions. That can be asthma. That could be another respiratory infection. It could be cancer. That's one way that there seems to be an interaction, but just in terms of spread or incidence, we rarely have coincidence data so it's very, very hard to be able to do these models in the first place. One thing that I'd like to make a call on is, coronavirus is showing us how important the social contagion aspect around diseases can be. That's one place where we could have access to data, right? If you wanted to parameterize a good model for coronavirus, you would want to know what fraction of that population thinks coronavirus is just like another flu, or is that hoax, or that social distancing doesn't work, or that everything is dumb, right? You want to know what kind of misinformation is spreading and where, so that your model can take that into account. We have access to that data, or some people do. I don't. That data exists out there. I think the idea that public health messaging, whether from officials or just individuals on social media, should probably be treated as public health data, and therefore should be public in some anonymized way, but that would be incredibly useful for modelers and public health officials alike.Michael: You've led right into this last paper to discuss macroscopic patterns of interacting contagions are indistinguishable from social reinforcement. This is one you wrote with Sam Scarpino and Jean-Gabriel Young. It seems as if what this paper and what you've just been talking about suggests is that if we treat beliefs as something that we can be infected by, then this is an instance where it becomes especially obvious that there are benefits to associating online with people who have different beliefs than you do. That's sort of a speculation. We can just table that for a moment. [Laughs.]Laurent: Yeah, yeah.Michael: But that does seem like it would sort of help randomize a contact network in the meme structure of our society.Laurent: Right.Michael: Anyway, I'd love to hear you talk a little bit more deeply how you modeled and what insights you drew from those models about co-infection of a biological contagion and a memetic contagion and how that might change behaviors.Laurent: Right. Well, before I get into paper, that's again a very interesting point you bring up. It's one thing that we haven't studied enough, but we tend to assume one or multiple network structures, but the connection between the physical, social or contact network on which a virus might spread, to the sort of virtual nature or de-localized nature of information networks on social media, is something that we don't study enough. We know they overlap, so we assume that to some extent they're very much co-related, but that would be interesting to look at the importance of how different are your physical networks and your information networks that mostly live online. The reason why that'd be important is in part because of this paper.The way this started was in 2015 when Ben Althouse and I published our first paper on interacting contagions, a lot of the dynamical features that I talked about, so the idea that expected outbreak size is non-monotonous with respect to R0, or that you can have super exponential spread, or that these contagions can interact and can benefit from social isolation in clustering…all of that was brand new in public health modeling, but sort of old news in social modeling.In social sciences they've looked at contagions for a long time as well. There, contagions tend to be different. One way that I like to talk about this difference is that the number of exposures and the identity of people who expose you to a contagion matters a lot in the social realm, not so much in the infectious disease realm. The dumb example that I use all the time is if you have 10 friends telling you to go see the new Wonder Woman movie, that has more impact than one friend telling you 10 times in a row to go see the movie, right? It matters who signals to you, who sends you an exposure to that idea. In the realm of infectious disease, if you're healthy, whether it's one friend sneezing on you 10 times or 10 friends sneezing on you once each, well, really it's like roughly the same exposure. And maybe there's a genetic diversity in the different sneezes, but really, you're going to get sick or you're not, and you can sum up those exposures in a linear way. Right? So, models of infectious disease tend to be linear in terms of exposure, and that's not quite true in the social sciences.So social sciences that had all those features, so for exponential spread, discontinuity, like importance of clustering, so I was wondering (and that was in 2015) if you have data about the incidents of a very infectious disease through time, how can you tell whether it's a classic case of a classic model from public health—interacting contagions like the ones I described—or this type of social contagions that spread through social reinforcement? How can you tell these things apart?It took years to get a negative results, which is, well actually, you’re probably never going to be able to tell a social contagion time series apart from interacting contagion time series. Especially if you don't know what it might be interacting. So that was a negative result. The answer to my question was, no, you can't do it. But that turned out to be just as interesting, because I did mention that models of interacting contagions get really, really complicated, right? It's just, there're so many states I can be in. So if I'm looking at n contagions I need to follow like, "Do I have this one? Do I have this one? That one?" And I have so many assumptions to make about how they interact with each other.But if in some way I can tell what comes out of those models or that dynamical system apart from social models, then why not use social models in the public health space, right? They're much simpler, and while they don't make sense, like this idea of social reinforcement doesn't quite make sense from a disease perspective, but if it's useful as a forecasting tool or as a modeling tool, then maybe we should embrace that. Right? So the idea is that this thing seems to spread like you'd expect social contagion to spread, and that helps us understand like who can leverage the work that has been done for decades in the social sciences to hopefully better understand interacts with contagions in the future.Michael: Kind of a stray question for me after listening to you talk about this is whether you would have gotten the same results 50 years ago? Or whether what we're really looking at here is a transition in the structure of society into this sort of more virtualized network structure?Laurent: Yeah, I think we just have a lot more data. We've been able to track social contagions like never before because of social media. There's always been people refusing to take social distancing measures but we just never knew that, and we didn't quite know what messaging they were using to talk to each other. But now, it's all like mostly out in the open and on social media so we do know a lot more and we're able to look at the interaction of social contagions with infectious disease like never before.Before coronavirus…I think this might be my new favorite example, although it's a terrible situation, but from a dynamical system perspective, it's just so rich. My previous example that I was using before to talk about this was the measles outbreak in the Philippines. You might have heard me talk about this before because I do talk about it a lot, but it's just a fascinating system. So, the Philippines also have quite a bit of dengue, right? And dengue has four strains. So dengue 1, 2, 3, 4.And it can interact in some ways because you can get a phenomenon by which like if you've had dengue 2 and then six months later you see dengue 3, your immune response might still be good enough so that your antibodies are typed to the virus, but not strong enough to neutralize the virus. And really, what you end up doing is that you're just providing sort of a genetic material disguise to the virus and helping it invade you. So by having had dengue 2 six months ago, you're making yourself more susceptible now to other strains of dengue, potentially.So what this meant was that in the Philippines, they introduced... I think they were one of the first country to introduce a tetravalent dengue vaccine, meaning of vaccine that works for all four strains. But it didn't work equally well for all four strains. So a lot of especially young kids that got the vaccine ended up getting a reaction by which they were more susceptible to certain strains of dengue than if they didn't get the vaccine at all. So the government, as far as I know, did the right thing of pulling back on the vaccine and messaging publicly saying, "Okay, this vaccine puts certain populations at risk so you're only going to get this vaccine if you're above a certain age or if you've had experienced dengue before."Messaging around infectious diseases as we're seeing now in the United States and pretty much everywhere in the world is just very, very tricky. So what people heard was not, "Take the vaccine only under these conditions." Really people heard, "See the vaccine is dangerous. We knew all along," and it did spark a huge anti-vaccination movement in the Philippines, which is why there's now a big measles outbreak. And I like this story because it's a terrible story whose origins are very well understood interactions between dengue strains. Everyone involved was meaning well. And then this interaction between dengue strains interacted with the existing anti-vaccination movement, which then fed back into measles, which would spread in many countries now.So it used to be like my favorite example, but now especially in China and the U.S., we're seeing so many patterns of how social viral messaging online and online media are interacting with the spread of coronavirus that I think all of this together is going to be a big wake-up call that we need to treat messaging around public health data as public health in and of itself. Right? So how people talk about diseases should be considered public health and should be included in our models.Michael: I want to get you back to your working group, but before I let you go, there were just a couple of quick questions from the social media audience that I want to give you an opportunity to respond to. One is about what kind of tools, software and capabilities you find you and your colleagues are currently lacking in your daily work, where the bottlenecks are for you in research. And then possibly, how amateurs could support this research, and if there's anything that the citizen science audience can do to assist right now.Laurent: Yes, there's been different efforts throughout the last decades to try and get more people involved. So we've been in the United States and Canada, which is the two country I know best, we’ve been okay but not incredible at infectious disease surveillance. And that's one way that I think the general public could really, really help. So there are different initiatives, like Flu Near You is one, where basically it's self-reported flu cases, or flu-like symptoms. And that gives us a better idea than a lot of official data that comes out, because really what better way than to have a distributed surveillance network that just relies on individuals?There are different initiatives like that to try and get citizen science involved in disease surveillance. And really I think going forward that's going to be critical both for existing outbreaks, existing pandemics that we just live with, like the seasonal flu, or emerging outbreaks like coronavirus right now.The second part of the question I think is what resources we're lacking. It's been really interesting. So at the University of Vermont and the Vermont Complex Systems Center where I'm based, we're lucky to be partnered with Google. And it was very interesting to see companies like that that have their own problems to deal with, but they did reach out and offered cloud services and computing powers and all that. So, technology is a big issue because public health science is well-funded but not to the extent that I think it should, and it's been interesting to see a lot of people offering help and resources in that way. Either computing resources or just help sharing the data.I think being critical of the messaging that you see online, just reading to make sure what you're reading is correct and validated by other sources, and then making sure that you spread the validated messages far and wide and try and make sure that misinformation doesn't spread as much is probably more important than the two previous things I mentioned.Michael: Last question for you. If you are going to advise people to track this at home with limited time and attention…if you can only offer one or a handful of data points to keep an eye on, what would those be? What do you consider the most important factors here to be staying on top of?Laurent: You're talking to Carl Bergstrom, too, right? Are you talking to him later?Michael: I will be, yes.Laurent: Can you ask him that question? [Laughs.]Michael: I will definitely ask him that question.Laurent: As now, I'm just passing it along.Michael: All right, sounds good. All right, thank you.Laurent: He’s the misinformation expert, so you know.Michael: Yeah, definitely. Thank you so much for your insights today.Laurent: This was great. Thank you for inviting me.
24,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: Sam Scarpino. Thank you for joining us.Sam: Thanks for having me.Michael: Yeah. Circumstances, less than great. But then again, this is a moment where folks with your expertise get to rise to the occasion. I interviewed your coauthor, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne…however you say French-Canadian names…Sam: That's a great pronunciation.Michael: …earlier this week, but the recording is lost in ZOOM Cloud processing limbo. So I do want to just briefly cover a couple of topics, that I covered with him, knowing that it may be awhile before we actually get to put those out on the feed. And one of those is the paper you wrote, with him and Jean-Gabriel Young, “Macroscopic patterns of interacting contagions are indistinguishable from social reinforcement.”Sam: Yes.Michael: So I think this is a really key point for people to get. I think it's good to lead with this one. Can you talk a little bit about the thoughts behind this particular study, what drove you to do this, and how the results that you came to differ from traditional thinking about this?Sam: Absolutely. The reason that we started thinking about this project is that for years, probably at least a decade or more now, there's been an observation that the mathematics behind how we think certain kinds of social contagions spread... so you could think of a meme or a hashtag on Twitter or anything that we think is spreading like a contagion but is not a biological pathogen... that the mathematics of how some of those move, from person to person, look very similar to how some biological pathogens may be interacting with each other as they spread through a population of hosts.In particular, you get an increase in the importance of the nonlinear dynamics associated with the disease spread, similar to what happens when you have certain kinds of social contagions. And this led us to try to answer the question, is the similarity kind of superficial? Doesn't mean that it's not interesting. Or is it something that actually is indicative of a much deeper relationship between the way in which we study social contagion and the way in which we study biological contagion?Michael: So if I'm reading this paper correctly, one take-home is that beliefs that engender specific kinds of behaviors act as a sort of co-infection with actual biological pathogens. And that certain ideas spread in a way that primes a population for an epidemic. I mean that's a piece of it, right?Sam: It is a piece of it. Well, there's sort of two main conclusions of the paper. The first is, the answer to the question that we were posing is yes. There is a deep relationship. In particular, you can show mathematically that these models have interacting pathogens. So two viruses spreading through the population can be mapped onto a model of social contagion. So that was the answer to the scientific question we were interested in.To answer your question, what this means is that there are lots of ways in which two social contagions could interact with each other. Two biological contagions could interact with each other. And, or, as you were pointing out, a social contagion could be interacting with a biological contagion. A couple of examples of that from the COVID outbreak: one of the first cases of COVID that we detected in the United States was in Boston. And this was a college student who had come back recently from China and had pretty mild symptoms—mild enough that, almost certainly, we would not have picked up on this case, except for the fact that everybody was hyper-attuned to this new emerging disease outbreak. And as a result, we are identifying earlier cases.And so this, of course, identifying cases... then these individuals can self-isolate, as we're doing now, and try to prevent ongoing transmission. And so not only does the social contagion around fear or concern around COVID… not only does it increase maybe the chance that we detect some of these spaces, so it affects our datasets that affects our public health understanding. It actually can really feed back on the transmission process because once we identify that individual, then they self-isolate until the symptoms clear, and it prevents ongoing transmission.Michael: So I'll leave deeper discussion with that paper for our eventual Laurent episode.Sam: Yes.Michael: But, just want to make a note that in your discussion, you say, "Interacting simple contagions are mathematically equivalent to complex contagions if we assume well-mixed populations." And that seems like a segue into another piece. This is a medrxv preprint on “The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID19 epidemic in China,” where you're using real-time mobility data from Wuhan and other detailed case data, including travel history. You're looking at how social isolation measures were able to interrupt this there. And maybe look forward with that insight into how comparable measures might work in other places. Can you talk about this one a little, please?Sam: Yeah. Absolutely. To your point about mass action mixing... so what we mean by that is that individuals mix randomly following kind of an ideal gas law for how they interact. It's clearly not a realistic assumption. And in fact, it's interesting that we have that in our paper, because one of the things that we spend a lot of time working on, both in my group and in collaboration with Laurent and others, is really relaxing those assumptions. So this is kind of unusual territory for us to be in. However, what we were able to show is that in some limited network cases you get the same results. One of the things that happens with networks—and this is why we were interested in the mobility for COVID—is that lots of different kinds of social network structures can also drive the sorts of nonlinear dynamics that we see in these interacting pathogens.So, if you have an arbitrarily complex social network, you can get arbitrarily anything with respect to the dynamics. And so, we need to place some constraints on what we're studying in order to get a clean solution mathematically. So that then takes us to thinking about the mobility stuff for COVID19, which is, as I just mentioned, we know that social networks, mobility networks, that's what's moving around these pathogens. And there were a number of things that were unprecedented with respect to the initial Chinese response. Wuhan is over 10 million people. It's one of the largest cities in the world. Cordoning off a city of that size is completely unprecedented in the history of humanity. However, there were also a bunch of other measures, some of which we're seeing now in the U.S. and South Korea and Italy, which is the shelter-in-place, reduced social gatherings, remote work, those kinds of things.And so we wanted to understand, what was the relative importance of those different measures? And also incorporate other things that we're all grappling with, like the availability of molecular testing, etc. So that was really the focus of this study, is given the importance we know exists for social networks and mobility and all of these things that happen in China, what can we learn about what works? And what the complications were?Michael: In Figure 4 in this paper, which talks about shifting age and sex distributions over time, it looks as though you see a demographic shift in age cohorts and in male-female sex ratios during the course of this intervention. What is going on with that?Sam: That's right. So we think that the situation there is differences in the early part of the outbreak in Wuhan, that we still don't fully understand, caused there to be a bias sex ratio in terms of the number of cases. So more men than women. And for a respiratory pathogen, approximately 50% male, 50% female in the population, we would not necessarily expect there to be a statistically significant bias.And then also with the age... we see it in Wuhan... you have a different age distribution than in the rest of China. And with the mobility, what we're able to see is you actually get the kind of shifting of these age distributions in such a way that it is strongly indicative of the importance of the mobility in moving the pathogen around. So we took the fact that you have this unusual age distribution to then try and assess the role of mobility. Or at least provide an additional line of evidence that mobility was really key for moving this pathogen around.Michael: If I'm reading this correctly, you conclude that their combination of interventions was successful.Sam: That's right. Wuhan has basically had multiple days strung together of almost no cases and all over China, excuse me, all over China they're coming back to work. You know, manufacturing is coming back online and so it really does seem to have worked. Similar measures worked in South Korea, although they didn't end up implementing the strict mobility cordons that we saw in China. Of course South Korea caught it a little bit earlier, which makes it easier to control with less severe measures.Michael: Yeah, you end this by making an important point, which is, “More analyses will be required to determine how to optimally balance expected positive effects on health with negative impacts on individual liberties, the economy, and society at large.” When I ask people what kind of questions they had on social media for this mini series, this was one of the big questions: how can we possibly began to understand something as complex and multidimensional as, “Where do we draw the line?” Questions of who's holding the knife come up a lot here. I mean even our manager of communications, Jenna Marshall, I was curious to know if you have any thoughts on the longer term implications of the virus and its containment.Sam: It's a great question. I had a conversation this morning with a journalist who had very similar thoughts and concerns around, “How do we balance the high value that we place on privacy with the need to respond effectively to this outbreak?” And that's something that we're going to have to have a conversation about very quickly as a society. And I do think that there's a role here for technology because there should be a way in which we can get some of the critical information that we need to respond without necessarily the wholesale… violation is probably too strong a word, but… the wholesale sacrifice of some of our individual privacy. My hope is that for example, we would be interested in finding out the fraction of people that have symptoms, and how many social contacts they might've had in a particular window of time around them getting symptoms.Those are the kinds of things that we could have, even if it's collected at the individual level, reported out in aggregate such that you're protecting privacy, and would still get most of the benefits from capturing that information. So I do really think this is a situation where we're going to have to balance carefully the costs and benefits. And I think as you were sort of alluding to, there are of course some longer-term consequences. As soon as you give up a little bit of bound on privacy, it can be hard to get that ground back. And so it's not just that we're looking at this outbreak, it's we're looking at what kind of precedents, legal and otherwise, does this set for privacy concerns going forward?Michael: There was a New York Times article recently on Kinsa Smart Thermometers. They were talking about how they've been using these internet connected thermometers to predict the spread of the flu and that they're now tracking the coronavirus or they believe they are tracking the coronavirus in real time.Millions of people have these smart thermometers. This is one of these sort of interesting situations that I think dovetails nicely into another paper that you lead authored up on arxiv right now, “Socioeconomic bias and influenza surveillance,” and how exactly we're currently deploying different datasets and how we might start thinking about coming up with sort of more even-handed and humane ways of tracking these things. This piece was about influenza specifically, but could you talk a little bit about how the U.S. is currently tracking epidemics, what kind of data sets they're using and what kind of biases in that data you found in this study?Sam: Yeah, that's a great point and it's something that I'm really interested in and I think is also really got to be top of mind for us with respect to COVID19. Some of us are fortunate enough to have jobs that there will at least seemingly continue through the epidemic, that we have enough money to buy food and keep our families fed and healthy. Large percentages of the population don't.I think the number is something like 40 - 50% of the U.S. doesn't have over $400 in emergency money that they can tap into for any reason. And so, one of the things we need to be very cautious about and thoughtful about with respect to our COVID response, is these individuals who are in either at risk or marginalized communities. You close the schools… well, schools also are an important source of lunch and before and after work care for large percentages of the population. And so making sure that we can continue to provide these kinds of services is really going to be critical.So what we show in this paper that you mentioned is, the longest running results in epidemiology, is that individuals who are in lower socioeconomic groups have higher health burden. And oftentimes that's because they are forced to live in more environmentally marginal parts of our communities, they have lower nutrition. More recently, especially in countries like the U S with our health care system, they don't have access to the same kinds of health care, which causes an increase in health burden. That's known.So we show that quite clearly in the state of Texas, three times the population controlled number of hospitalizations due to influenza in the lowest 25% of individuals by income. However, what we also show is that our ability to forecast the hospital demand in those most at risk populations, keeping in mind they have the largest burden of hospitalization is much less accurate in terms of our ability to forecast and in the individuals in the upper three fourths of the income distribution. And that is precisely because all of the data that we have for the most part comes from healthcare systems. And these individuals are sicker because they all have access to the healthcare system.So that's why we refer to this as kind of a blind spot, which is that the data that we have is biased against the individuals who are most at risk precisely because they don't have access to the healthcare system. And of course this also, at least in our minds, fits into this broader narrative around biases when it comes to data-driven decision making, algorithmic decision making, machine learning, artificial intelligence, that we don't have any data on these populations and as a result it is essentially impossible to generate actionable forecasts on their demand.Michael: You make a point here that it's important to improve the timeliness, the accuracy, situational awareness forecasting, but it's sort of a garbage-in-garbage-out scenario unless you actually are getting a complete, or a reasonably complete, dataset.I remember one of the paper’s co-authors, Lauren Ancel Meyers, an SFI External Professor, when she gave her Ulam Lecture last year on “Preventing the Next Pandemic,” she talked about some of these new methods of data collection. I mean it's not super new and in fact it's been canceled, but Google Flu Trends correlating search data, people looking up Google searches for signs, symptoms, and treatment. What are some of the other new ways of harvesting large datasets that you think might help patch up this sort of under-reported quartile of the population?Sam: Absolutely. That's something we looked at a little bit in the paper. We show that Google Flu Trends does not ameliorate any of the data bias. And one of the things, again, that's sort of a blind spot in our minds is we think of everybody having access to a high speed internet and smartphones. Even though a large percentage of the population does, there's still a sizable percentage that does not, and not surprisingly, that overlaps with the percentage of the population that are most at risk for influenza, which are these individuals in lower socioeconomic groups and the elderly. And so we think that's a reason that there's a gap there.In this case it's really tough because if they don't have access to any of these healthcare providers systems, how do you actually get information on what's going on in these populations, is something that lots of state and governments are constantly wrestling with. Maybe I'm not going to have a good answer because I think the tech solutions that we're all excited about and can provide lots of really valuable information about other parts of the population are still largely going to be blind to these individuals.Michael: We've got a question from social media about what data points you personally are tracking. What do you find to be the most salient metrics to stay on top of right now in updating your understanding and your modeling of this outbreak?Sam: For me, I think the most important data points to track are things like ventilator demand, number of individuals in the ICUs, those pieces, because one, that's what we're watching very carefully in terms of any risks for hospitals being overwhelmed, but also because they're going to be much less sensitive to reporting issues. They're going to be biased in their own way, but the test rates don't effect, they do affect sort of, but they don't really affect the number of people that need ventilators. If you need a ventilator, you need a ventilator, and even if you haven't gotten the COVID test yet and you need a ventilator, you still need the ventilator. So those kinds of information, they both tell us what the risks are for how close we're getting to a hospital reaching capacity. But they also help us benchmark the test positivity rates, the case reports, all the other pieces of information that we know are biased because of under-reporting. We start to leverage these different data sets against each other to get a more complete picture of how many cases are out there.Michael: When I spoke to Andy Dobson earlier this week, he made a good point about how herd immunity requires the majority of the population to develop an immunity. And right now China reported, what was it, 100,000 confirmed cases or something like that? It was so extremely below the number of people that would have to have contracted it for the population to have developed herd immunity. And so it looks like we're sort of lurching back into business-as-usual or at least the first few countries to be infected are… and Andy was kind of convinced that this is going to become an endemic infection, that it's something that we're going to be dealing with for a long time. I saw that MIT Technology Review put up a thing about modeling intermittent social distancing over the next 18 plus months. It seems like a lot of people are expecting us to be able to get back to normal, but normal is no longer in view anymore.Sam: Well, I think we're probably going to be in a situation where normal is going to be very different certainly for a period of time into the future. The point around how we're going to deal with herd immunity is a really complex one because as you pointed out, China didn't get anywhere near herd immunity. Obviously they put in these fairly incredible measures, and I'm not saying incredible in terms of whether they're good or bad, I'm saying incredible in terms of that they’re totally unprecedented. But still, maybe somewhere in the range of a half a percent to 2 or 3% of the population got infected. That's not even anywhere near close to the herd immunity threshold. The other piece of it is we don't know about how long lived the immunity is for this pathogen. So there's good evidence that individuals will be immune for a period of time.We don't know what that period of time is. And so the herd immunity also presupposes that individuals will be immune for a year or two years. There might not be. The other is, that also assumes that people are not going to take measures into their own hands. So we can see all over the United States that people were reducing social contacts well before any mandatory orders were put into place because the social contagions are spreading as well as the biological contagion, and we're starting to change our behavior. And so what you're really risking with that herd immunity strategy is really just killing a bunch of people and not actually getting the outcome you want. And so I really think it's not really an ethical question, for example, cause it was clear the UK had already made that ethical decision. I think the real question is, it's very damn unlikely to work.And so that to me is the problem. I mean actually the real problem is the ethical problem. We should not have a strategy that involves killing a sizable percentage of the population. But, even if you were going to get over that ethical hurdle, it still isn't going to work. And I think that's the situation that was really unfortunate about those conversations—although, I think it's very clear that the scientific community, especially in UK were able to inform the government and help them think through that scenario. I will say that to me is one of the really, such as there can be bright spots aside from penguins roaming around the shed aquarium during this outbreak. One of them has been, I think gave the tight interface between public health, academic, scientific research, private sector, everybody, government kind of coalescing NGOs around this initiative, sharing data, sharing resources, building models, helping to inform public policy, supporting each other. That has been really exciting to see and I think is a big part of the reason why we're starting to move in the right direction with respect to the response.Michael: Yeah. Actually that, I think you sort of preempted my last question to you, which is, what is the good news? And it sounds like: collaboration, learning an effective real-time response to crisis.Sam: Collaboration is good news. It's good news that we're taking this thing seriously. It's super important. We're ramping up the testing, we're going to need that testing when we try to come back to normal. The strategies that they have in South Korea that are working really well. Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, mainland China now, involve this sort of high rate of testing, coupled with case isolation when you identify them, to help bring things back to normal. And so this test volume that we have now is going to be super important for our current response, but it's also going to be incredibly important for our ability to come a little bit more back to normal a little bit earlier because we can engage in this kind of “test, isolate, measure” once the cases start to come back down, that will allow us to try to control the outbreak as best as possible.Michael: Awesome. Thanks Sam. I look forward to having you back on the show when we're no longer on a war footing.Sam: Absolutely. Me too. Thanks so much for this. And have a great day.
25,Episode Details / Transcript Michael: David, it is a pleasure to have you back on Complexity Podcast.David: It's wonderful to be with you.Michael: Together apart. So we're here to talk about this new essay series that Santa Fe Institute is doing, the Transmission series, a set of complex systems perspectives on the COVID-19 pandemic, and its sort of broader consequences and implications. Why don't we start by just explaining a little bit about the villain of this drama, the virus itself. Tell us a little bit about RNA viruses, and then what you had in mind for framing this essay series as an exploration of these broader issues.David: Yeah, absolutely. These are trying times for all of us. And I think we want to just try and get as many useful ideas on the table as possible. I thought I might just start by explaining what a virus is and what a coronavirus is, in particular, and what makes it so frightening. Viruses are parasites, and they're parasites that can only reproduce by gaining access to the cells of their hosts. And once in there, they hijack or hack the machinery of the cell, in order to copy themselves and continue their transmission.Now, viruses come in a lot of different shapes and sizes. For some of them, DNA is their genome, like us, and some of them have RNA genomes, like the coronavirus. The coronavirus is a very big RNA virus by the standards of RNA viruses, about 30,000 bases long. The good news about that is that, unlike most RNA viruses, it's not very mutable. The reason why it's so big is to ensure that its replication is high fidelity. So most viruses that are small make tons of mistakes when they copy themselves, but the Coronavirus is very large and has a machinery in place to ensure that's not true. And it's good news for us because it means that once we have a vaccine, we won't have to constantly be reinventing it because the virus will be the same one, we hope, unlike flu, which is very mutable.Coronaviruses have been around for a long time. They account for about 30% of common colds, along with other viruses like rhinoviruses, and usually we haven't been that concerned about them because they're not very virulent. They don't cause lots of pathology. And this one does. Now this virus is particularly horrible because it hijacks a physiological mechanism that we are all dependent on, and that's sometimes called the renin–angiotensin pathway, and this is the way that the body regulates various cardiovascular functions. The Coronavirus, this particular one, COVID-19, binds to one of the crucial cell surface receptors that we need to regulate our cardiovascular system and gains entry into the cell.A variety of different groups are more or less susceptible to the virus; diabetics, for example, because they have more of this receptor, so there's more for the virus to access and enter, and of course, people who are potentially having medication for cardiovascular disease might also suffer because that also interferes with this pathway. So this is a particularly horrible virus because it's targeting something that we absolutely need and have and exploiting that need in order to ensure that it replicates itself effectively.The virus itself has lots of different proteins in it, everyone's heard of the spike protein, the S protein, and this is that one that gives it its name coronavirus because they look like little sunspots, and it needs that to get into the cell. So current vaccine development is, in part, targeting that spike protein to prevent it getting in the cell. But the most frightening protein it has is called the E protein. This sits in its membrane, and there elicits an immune response. It generates what are called cytokines, which are small little peptides that lead to inflammation, little proteins that tell immune system to trigger the inflammation response. It's the inflammation response that gives rise to the edema, the filling up the lungs with water, that give us our respiratory complications. So there is this little protein, it causes our immune system to go a bit haywire, leading to these horrible pathologies that we're all hearing about. So it's not the spike protein that's necessarily causing the damage, but it's the spike protein that gives it access to the cell.Michael: So there we have the map of the problematic in miniature. Let's move on to this essay series and the broader motivation for doing this.David: Yeah. So, SFI has been working on virus evolution, immunology and epidemiology for 25 years, and many of our researchers are on the front line of this disease. They're forecasting the progress of disease, providing that to the CDC and the White House. They're working on tests, repurposing fundamental research labs in order to make them useful to society. And that's actually something very interesting, Michael, that all of these labs that were doing what we would call basic science or fundamental science, it's taken almost no time in this period of great urgency for them to turn around and actually provide a service to society, which I think is a really interesting fact. It hasn't really been noted that these distinctions that we often make between basic and applied or fundamental aren't really real, because when it comes to crisis and when it comes to real need, scientists are very prepared, fundamental scientists, to turn around and turn that into an applied project very quickly. So that's been a big part of what we've been up to as a community.But beyond that, there are all these questions, the other ramifying cascading effects of this infection on behavior, on commerce, on transport, on ecology, human psychology, institutional credibility. These are the things that are making life so trying, above and beyond the primary infection; flu doesn't do this. And this series is an effort to explore why it is that a tiny bug that's thousands of times smaller than a grain of salt, that has none of the alarming features of an AI that we've been talking about kill switches for the last several years, is actually bringing down the complex systems of the world. And we would like to understand that, in order to forestall this happening ever again; what we need to put in place, what new ideas we need, what new models we need, what new social norms we should cultivate, in order to ensure this kind of tragedy doesn't repeat itself, and that's what this series will be about. So everything, if you like, all the layers of the onion, above and beyond the primary biology of the virus and epidemiology.Michael: Before we started recording, you and I kind of mapped out how the first five essays in this series are linked to one another conceptually. I think we're going to save Simon DeDeo's for the end, but I think it's worth noting, just to connect to what you just said and to lead into your introductory piece, that this is one of those issues where we don't notice the systems upon which we depend until they break. So that very, very, very small virus, leading to a global systemic restructuring is really a perfect ... in the way that it exploits our own physiological vulnerabilities to great effect. It's also an interesting sort of invitation to a broader menu of really important fundamental complex systems concepts. So the first concept that seems worth discussing is the name of the series itself: Transmission. So why don't you kick us off with a course outline of your article that we'll link to in the show notes?David: Yeah. What I tried to do is try to understand why it is that this particular outbreak has been so disruptive of so many complex systems. If you look at diseases like cancer or Alzheimer’s, or respiratory infection in general, or cardiovascular disease, these things have been around for a long time, are terrifying, cause many many deaths, and there's very little prospect of us curing them in the next decade or more. And yet, they haven't led to catastrophic failure of systems. And I wanted to understand why.Now, one of the characteristics of these diseases is that they're truly complex in the following sense: If you look at cancer, there is no one gene that is responsible for the disease, there are many tens, if not hundreds, if not thousands. And that's made treatment very hard, because you can't target one site in the genome. So that's a negative from the point of view of intervention. On the other hand, that is a property of complex systems that's critical for robustness. Our body doesn't want to give one lever or one switch that controls the entire system to one function or one disease because it collapses the complexity into simplicity, and it allows for the possibility of complete disruption with a single point of change. So complexity is actually what we would call homeostatic. It's a good thing, it's hard to understand, but it means is much harder to hijack.Now, look at this particular outbreak. What was very clear to me and many others is that there was one basic dominant causal principle at all complex scales, and that's transmission. So the virus transmits from cell to cell, it then transmits from body to body in social networks, it then transmits across cities, through commerce, and surfaces. It then transmits from city to city through transport networks, and then across the globe. And it hijacks supply chains, in some sense, in the same way that it was hijacking the ACE receptor. It's hijacking the transmission mechanisms of our world. And that does something strange. It leads to a paradoxical simplicity, which gives the virus huge power over a number of scales that wouldn't be true, for example, for Alzheimer's. That was the first point I wanted to make, which is: human culture has become vulnerable at the layer of transmission because too many different mechanisms are aligned. So moving forward, we have to think about engineering misalignments, in some sense, such that this can't happen.The second point I was trying to make is: quarantine and social isolation are actually collaboration in this world; by staying home, you're not just hiding from the menace, you're actively participating in misaligning one element of this complex system, so as to interfere with the progress of the infection. So this idea somehow that a citizen could actually play a part that was as important as a vaccine, but instead of preventing transmission of the virus into another cell at the ACE receptor level, it's preventing transmission of the virus at the social network level. So we're actually adopting a kind of behavioral vaccine policy, by voluntarily or otherwise self-isolating. I think it's a very important point for everyone to understand, and I actually argued in that article that everyone should be awarded some fraction of the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the sacrifices they're making in order to minimize the transmission.Michael: Yeah. I think that the price would be significantly less than proposed federal bailouts, but the fractional prestige would be a nice consolation. This piece that seems linked to something that we've already discussed a couple of times on the show in the last few weeks, talking to SFI network epidemiologists, about how there's another layer of transmission, which is the informational and behavioral contagions that you allude to here, in terms of how do we get people to adopt different behavioral regimes that are going to relate to the transmission of this virus in complex ways.David: Yeah, I know what you’re getting at. One of the things that we've been working on, our community, for the last several decades, is the mathematics of infectivity. We can write down equations or computational models to describe how things transmit. And one of the things that we discovered very early is that the same kinds of mathematics used to describe the transmission of disease could be used to describe the transmission of ideas, and the same kinds of networks that promote or impede the transmission of disease promote or impede the transmission of ideas. So that's in part what I mean by the alignment.One of the things that happened in this particular outbreak is the memetic transmission, if you like, the transmission of ideas, was much faster than the transmission of the virus. But the disappointment, I think, that many of us felt is we didn't act on that. We weren’t, if you like, leveraging the comparative advantage of idea infection over biological infection. But that common mathematical structure that applies to both cases and more, incidentally, is very valuable because it does give us insights into how we might be able to bring these systems out of alignment to potentially control them.Michael: Yeah. So with that we can frame the next four articles in this series as the beginning of an effort in a kind of informational contagion. Like a conceptual vaccine maybe.David: Yes.Michael: Let's start with David Kinney's piece because I think this piece addresses something that's really critical here, something that we talked about when he was on the show a few weeks ago about the difference between the way that science is actually practiced and the way that it's publicly perceived, and that typically there's rhetoric around science that this is objective and purely quantitative: “Just give me the numbers.” But especially when you're dealing with models of complex scenarios that produce a spectrum of possible futures, that there is a hidden value judgment that scientists and scientific advisors have to make in communicating their findings, and that that value judgment is driven by a kind of market dynamics about the estimation of risk in giving the broadest available spectrum of possibility, versus giving the clearest and most actionable advice.David: Yeah. As you know, Michael, here we are in New Mexico, where Los Alamos is based, where the Manhattan Project was conducted. And to my mind, that's one of the most salient examples of this fuzzy boundary line between basic science and policy. If you remember, General Leslie Groves appointed Robert Oppenheimer to basically oversee the production of the atom bomb. That first collaboration worked out, from their point of view, reasonably well. Oppenheimer was overseeing the science, and Groves was interfacing with government and society in a certain way.But when it came to the hydrogen bomb, everything changed, and Oppenheimer was so demoralized by what had happened with the dropping of the two atom bombs, that he felt compelled to make policy remarks. And that led, as we all know, to various trials and conflicts between Teller and Oppenheimer, where Oppenheimer was accused of being a communist spy. So it's an extremely difficult problem, and scientists are, quite naturally, as a consequence, very cautious about making policy recommendations.What David says in his transmission article is that in the late 50s there were philosophers and ethicists who were advocating for a strict division of power, and this is largely the work of Richard Jaffe and Isaac Levy. They suggest that it was the role of the scientist to just give raw numbers to policymakers and politicians and allow them to make the decisions. What David points out is: what policymakers want is certainty. So if I, as a scientist, provided you with probabilities for certain outcomes, if those probabilities are near one or zero, you will act on them. That's what you want, certainty. On the other hand, they're much less likely to be correct.On the other hand, if I give you nuances, subtlety, and say, "Well, maybe there's a 0.6 probability of that and 0.4 four of that," you, as a policymaker, are very dissatisfied, but it's more likely to be closer to the true distribution of outcomes. So there's a catch-22 here. Scientists want to present the true numbers, but the true numbers are unlikely to be popular to the policymakers. So we are forced to exaggerate the severity of outcomes, in order to have them adopted. And I think this is actually a problem that can't be escaped.Michael: Yeah, and in a way, this is also a sort of outbreak of its own, at least conceptually, where we're no longer assigning the accountability or the authority of these values-laden decisions to… It's sort of the typical process to want to pass the buck: blame the politician, "Well, they were just acting on the advisor." And then, it's like, "Well, actually, we have bad data…”David: Yeah. Let me say one more point on this, actually, Michael, which I think is very important, and that is: good scientists are comfortable with uncertainty, bad ones are not. This leads to a genuine conundrum, and it's why pseudoscience flourishes in periods of uncertainty in culture. Because if the real scientist is saying, "Look, we don't have the data to make the decision. To the best of my ability, these are the odds," and a bad scientist comes along and says, "No, I know exactly what's going on.” That's why bad scientific ideas are adopted so readily and with such alacrity in periods of great stress, because they appear to give certainty in periods of uncertainty.It's something that the public should be very cautious of. So when someone says. "I have a solution, I have a remedy," what they're really doing is exploiting this need for certainty, and I think it's a very desperately difficult situation to be in. But just like sport, where outcomes are not deterministic, the same is true of all complex systems, including disease. We have to cultivate our patience, I think, and our understanding that certainty is acquired very slowly, and be extremely suspicious of anyone who claims to have found a solution with inadequate data.Michael: When we had Rajiv Sethi on the show and he was talking about stereotypes within the context of criminal justice, one of the things that really lingered with me after that discussion was how so much of this comes down to the ways that our brains are tuned to reduce uncertainty by grouping what are determined to be equivalent experiences, equivalent phenomena.Now, given enough time, the ominous stranger in a dark alley, you might be able to sit down and have dinner with them and get to know them and develop a model of that person as a unique individual. But one of the problems with stereotyping and criminal justice, and also now as you just mentioned, the desire to cleave to oversimplified explanations, explanations that in a longer timeframe are going to appear maladaptive…is that we don't have the time to collect the data that we need and form the truly rigorous and robust models because of various problems with disease surveillance or economic urgency. So there's a balance that we have to strike, and I think that that leads into the next paper by Luu Hoang Duc and Jürgen Jost on what do we do when we're left with only bad data and relatively little time to act on it.David: Yeah. So, once again, let me just clarify, in periods of uncertainty, we have to learn to live with it and try as best as we can to avoid those claiming to have certainty in the face of inadequate data. So what Jürgen and Luu Hoang have done is they make a very interesting point, and this is very paradoxical, I think. And that is that when data is really bad, you should use the simplest model at hand. When data is very good, you can use complicated models. There's been a lot of conversation about this early prognostication that came out of the Imperial College model. It had, in retrospect, potentially wildly overestimated the number of fatalities, and now, of course, that model has been modified, so as to reduce that number.One of the problems with that model philosophically is it was vastly too complicated given the data that we had. There was a temptation, because of policy in fact, to put everything in, so we're going to put in the number of schools, the age distribution, the household, the number of hospitals, their spatial locations, the position of airports. These are these very complicated agent-based models, and those models are absolutely critical when you have really good data, like those of cities under normal conditions.But what Jürgen and Luu Hoang are saying is, what if you don't? Well now, you should do the paradoxically opposite, use a simplest model you possibly can because they're much less sensitive to fluctuations in the data, what we would call they don't over-fit the data. The last thing you want to do is over-fit, parameterize a model based on sparse or bad data. And the particular idealization that they advocate is a linearization of the data. So if one reads that paper, you'll see they do linear extrapolations based on a logarithmic transformation—they essentially linearize the data, and they try to say that this would be, given our current state of uncertainty, the best course of action.Now, whether that's true or not, remains to be seen, but from the point of view of us as a community and these listeners, the key philosophical point is that if someone comes to a complicated model with bad data, you should be very suspicious of it, and you should be more tolerant of simplicity in times of uncertainty.Michael: Let me see if this analogy holds with you: we’re approaching Earth and we don't have a map of the coastlines of the continents, we're operating with a very low resolution camera deciding where to land. So you don't try to come up with a map of the coastlines based on data that's too granular, that you don't actually possess, that you basically just aim for the center of the continents and continue to update your maps as you get closer to it, as things come into focus.David: It's reasonable, I think. Maybe a better example would be in an economic setting where we have basic laws of supply and demand. They're very, very simple models. If the price goes down, then you're more likely to purchase. If the interest rates go down, you're more likely to borrow. So these are very simple models. And you can imagine a very complicated model that said, "I know exactly what Michael likes, I know what foodstuffs he purchases, I know what TV show you like, and I’m going to put all of them into my model.”  But now imagine that data was all totally bogus. That model would do much less well than the simple macroeconomic model that just looks at supply and demand regularities. So you only want to put complexity in your model, if it's justified by the empirical data. If it's not, leave it out because it will underperform the simple model.Michael: We have an example here. John Harte gave a simple model to reduce conflicting advice on the allowable group size, as we're going through school and business closures. This is something that I brought up with Laurent Hébert-Dufresne, when we had him on the show, this question of where are we getting these numbers that say 200 people is too many, but 25 is acceptable? This sort of gets back to that David Kinney remark on having to sort of place a bet on where you draw the line. But John's got a model here that's simple enough to understand and doesn't rely on complicated extrapolations about the internal structure of these different kinds of groups, and so on. You want to talk about that a little bit?David: Yeah. So one of the questions that we, all of us... Michael and I, like everyone else in the world, just being sensible now, are isolating and in quarantine. What we're doing essentially is reducing our exposure to others, reducing our group size. And what John asked was, "Look, what is a sensible, allowable number of individuals with whom you can interact?" And as we come out of quarantine, what the last thing we want to do is resume normal behavior where we titrate it or iterate up slowly towards normalcy.He gives a very interesting simple analysis. He has a model: you have a number of groups that could be schools, for example. Each school has a number of students in it. Typically you have more students in each school than you have schools. And what he shows is that if you double the size of a group, you have a four-fold increase in the transmission of the disease; this is called a superlinear scaling. In other words, even small groups can have very, very high transmission rates. So when we talk about these numbers, five, 10, 100, they're actually quite meaningful. I mean, I heard early quotes coming from, I won't name who, where they said "Well, there's no real difference between 10 and 100." There's a huge difference between 10 and 100! And the sensible thing for people to do would be to be in the single digits, that's what a sensible group size is. Because of the superlinearity of the scaling, a small increase in a group leads to a very large increase in transmission.So I would hope that what comes out of those simple models, if people can internalize this message, is that, as we basically break free of the grip of this horrible virus, we actually don't rapidly or too precipitously return to normal, but we gradually return to normal. That would be the sensible thing to do, it would be the considerate thing to do for all the citizens of the world, and I think John's model makes that extremely clear. So there is a difference between 10 and 100. There's a difference between one and 10, there's a difference betweem 10 and 20. In some sense, add one or two at a time, that seems kind of preposterous at one level, but it would be the sensible thing to do.Michael: To link this back to your piece, this is the continued citizen science experiment, that every time anybody leaves their house, they're increasing the size of that group, and then providing data to someone, hopefully not at great personal expense…In the case of this novel coronavirus what we have is a situation where, as people like SFI External Professor Lauren Ancel Meyers have shown in their research, the interval between someone receiving it and actually developing symptoms is great enough, this is part of why our data is so patchy on this particular outbreak, because it's probably impossible to reconstruct the actual transmission network. There are so many sort of mysterious links too far separated in time and space.And yet we've been relatively effective, at least by some measures, at containing it. Like you said earlier, this was a very rapid and emergent social mobilization. People were isolating themselves before they were ordered to do so by the governments. At least in that respect, it's, like you said, “an antiviral flash anti-mob.” Kudos to the Internet and the citizens of the Web for being able to coordinate our misalignments.David: I think that's absolutely right. I think you made a very good point earlier that this gets back to that notion of citizen based medicine. So, we're very used to these interventions that are in some sense biochemical, and they give us a sense of security because they're basically reductionist. But we're moving into a world now where everyone should see themselves as a part of a solution. And in a complex system, you are absolutely as important, if not more important, than the ACE receptor.This graduated return to normalcy is actually quite a sophisticated mathematical principle. If people could acquire these new kinds of habits, we'd make the world a much better place looking forward. What we would like to do, I think, is develop guidelines for sensible forms of behavior that don't feel oppressive, but feel empowering, that give people a sense of what they might be able to do under these circumstances. And they're not easy. They're actually, in some sense, more difficult than developing a vaccine because we're developing a social analogue. So you're absolutely right. I think every citizen now is actually, in some sense, empowered to control this pandemic. And what John's article is telling us is giving us an insight into how that should be engineered. So what I would like everyone to do is develop a kind of sophisticated sense of how social networks and transmissions work, in order that they can make the best decisions for themselves and society, in terms of how we roll back to normalcy.Michael: Right. But that brings us to Simon's piece because whatever normalcy we roll back into is going to look very different from the normalcy that was disrupted at the beginning of this year. As Andy pointed out in our episode, we've done such an excellent job at containing this, but very few of the models make it look like this is a one-wave infection. Very few of them make it look like we're going to have completely trounced this thing.It seems very likely that there will be additional waves, that there will be additional injunctions to get go back home after we have returned to work, to distance ourselves again, because we will not have infected enough people through our successful early containment efforts to have developed a herd immunity for this. This leads us into Simon's piece: we're in a kind of interregnum here where we don't really know what the new normal is going to be. Why don't you tell us how you read Simon's piece?David: Yeah. So this was Simon DeDeo's contribution. It's really about the dangers of habitual thinking and in relation to all that we've discussed before. Society has evolved over thousands of years, so as to minimize the cognitive burden on individuals. And we call that minimization habit formation. So we have rules of thumb, heuristics, that allow us to solve problems quickly because the environment in which we live is more or less constant. But when that environment changes, those habits become deleterious, they become maladaptive, they no longer fit.And then, we have to sit down and reason again. What Simon is arguing is now is the time for us to rethink thought, meaning rethink habit. There's a nice language for this. Daniel Kahneman wrote this book on system one and system two, where system one, if you like, is the instinctual, the reflexive, and system two is the analytical, the more ponderous. And what's happened, in a sense, is the crisis has forced us to move behaviors that would normally sit in system one into system two. It's almost as if all these years you've been playing chess, and someone came along and said, "Oh, by the way, the rook now can move on diagonals, and the king can move three squares on the horizontal and vertical, and the pawn actually now behaves like a bishop." Things that you would just have almost done automatically now you have to rethink completely, it's a really sort of difficult thing to have to handle and confront.I think what the pandemic has done is exactly that: things that we took for granted in society, things that are extraordinarily comforting for us, as human beings, human proximity and conversation and group living have been challenged, and we have to rethink it. Hopefully, we will return to that again, but we might not, and I think that's Simon's deep point, which is that it's time to be analytical again and to reconstitute what becomes habit of the future. One of the things that we can all be doing, as we're all incarcerated in this horrible moment, is to think a little bit about that. I mean, what would I change given that the world might throw at me a catastrophe of this scale again? We don't want to be crazy preppers, we don't want to become paranoid, this is not about stockpiling firearms, which seems to me absolutely ludicrous. But it is about being very thoughtful about a world, where perturbations of this magnitude or slightly less might be more common than we had anticipated, the so-called long tail.Michael: Yeah, as you've mentioned a few times in this, through your lens on the now suddenly obvious importance of individual citizens to a collective experimental process here… It's been interesting, I've been seeing a lot in the SFI-affiliated economics discussion about how this is changing the assumptions that we make about the balance between labor and capital, for instance. Recently, Suresh Naidu on Quartz was talking about the gig economy and how these essential independent contractors, are suddenly the stone upon which so much well-being is balanced right now. They have a negotiating power that they didn't have six months ago. Marketplace, in their reading group that's going on right now for the CORE Econ textbook that Suresh and Rajiv and Sam Bowles and Wendy Carlin and... who else is in on that one?David: Those are the dominant ones from SFI.Michael: Yeah. Marketplace was talking recently about how this is shifting the way that we understand healthcare from something that's conventionally understood as a private good to something that's understood as a public good, because this crisis has made it much more evident than it used to be that wellbeing is something that exists in a network, that if I get sick, it's going to affect your health, your economic wellbeing, and so on. What seems to me to be the trend here is a kind of democratization of the SFI way of thinking, really, an understanding of our individuality as something that is emergent and relational. How do you imagine that moving forward?David: Yeah. I’d like very much that society became more empirical, more analytical, more cooperative, more prosocial. These are things that we all hope for, but I'm not that optimistic. If you look what happened in 9/11, there was this extraordinary collegiality at the level of the globe, great sympathy, the prospect and possibility of global collaboration. But very quickly, it turned into rabid xenophobia and protectionism, and it sort of all went horribly wrong. I don't think we can place the blame anywhere in particular, but human beings very quickly reverted to their usual selfish selves.That's why I think this point about analysis versus habit is so crucial because what we sort of have to do is we have to make what is clear when we reason clear when we act, we have to turn thought into action by making analysis habit. Unless we do that, they'll just be a massive rebound to normalcy. I mean, look, we're all looking at oil prices, and it's extraordinary. We’re also looking at the incredible rapid cleaning up of the environment, given the reduced traffic and human activity. But we all know what's going to happen: as soon as a green light goes on, humans will go out and say, "Look how cheap gas is, I'm going to take road trips," and it'll massively increase production. And all of those transient positives that only a little bit offset the terrible negatives of what's happening to people in their lives, and unemployment and in terms of health, will be eradicated.So I'm not the person who believes in this. I believe that, unless you move from something into a social norm and a habit, it's basically behaving like a Pollyanna to think that the decency that one observes under periods of crisis are maintained in periods of normalcy. So we actually have to act in very thoughtful ways, in order to ensure that that's true, instead of hoping that it will be true.Michael: Certainly, although were we to rush back into this, we would be running back into the same wall that nailed us the first time. The normal that we would be rushing back into is a mirage, and the second lesson would be even more difficult than the first. So I imagine, over time, run multiple iterations of our foolish and uninhibited return to the great American road trip and business as usual, and it seems like it would select out those behaviors over two or three runs.David: But you see, I'm much more sympathetic to the desire for normal. The example that I like to give is exercise. One of the things we've learned, I think, in the last several decades, is that everyone wants to be healthier, but it's extremely difficult to change your habits. And there was this perception, say, 20 years ago that you'd have to sort of cut your caloric intake in half, and you'd have to start running 20 miles a day, and so forth. And no one could do it. Now we live in a much more humane world, you can say, "Look, if you take a 10 minute-walk, that's fantastic. That's genuine progress. You're developing habits that you can then build upon." And I think the worst thing that could happen is an alternative ideology, that doesn't like this one, proposes these draconian transformations of society that will be rejected wholesale.The right thing to do is learn from fitness coaches and say, "Look, it's not a big change, maybe we should stop shaking hands, right? It's not a big change, we should be a little bit more considerate of individuals in the gig economy." So incremental change is real change, revolutionary change is illusion. I think one of the things we learn from complexity is: any attempt to treat the system as if it was simple and that there are one or two levers that will lead to transformation is a mistake, and we have to have a nuanced attitude towards tiny changes in many different places.Michael: Well, that seems like a great place to tie a bow on it, David. What do we have looking forward into the next week? Do we know whose essays will be coming out next week?David: Yeah. I mean, it's quite exciting. I think we have some really interesting pieces. I’ll mention a few of them. One is the nature of zoonosis and pathogenesis, where did this virus come from, from the bat population? Why aren't the bats sick, but we are? How does that work? So that will be one. We'll have some insights from the socio-political crisis in Chile. What are the similarities between social upheaval in society and the kinds of experiences we're now having in the pandemic? And then, some very interesting analysis of the use of analogy, in trying to allow us to think through the crisis.David: So, we've heard mention of this being war and there being a wartime president, we've heard mentioned this is like the plague. What are these analogies doing? Are they useful or are they alarmist? So a whole set of issues in this general complexity perspective, which is looking at everything above and beyond the primary viral agent that's leading to this catastrophe?Michael: Well, excellent. David, I look forward to discussing the next round of Transmission articles with you here soon.David: Me too and best of luck to everyone at home. I hope you're being good to each other, and I hope that these ideas helped you in some small way.
26,Episode Details / Transcript MichaelDavid, it's a pleasure to jump back into the complexity with you.DavidYes, I'm looking forward to summarizing the next five Transmissions.MichaelAnd it's a good five this week. We've got Andy Dobson… Let's start there on Andy Dobson's “Need for disease models which capture key complexities of transmission,” because the origin story of this novel coronavirus in another animal is a really interesting point of the way that this is going to be remembered and a really key entry point for understanding some of the systems dynamics that have been revealed to us more popularly through this crisis.DavidYeah, so Andy's was a very rich contribution, I felt, and he made three very deep points. The first point was, why is it that a disease like this one is so much worse in cities, whereas a disease like malaria is actually worse in rural communities? And it comes down to this technical insight of what the modelers call a “density-dependent transmission” versus a “frequency-dependent transmission.” With density dependence as the term would seem to imply, the higher the density, the more transmission there is. And that's why we're socially isolating. So the more people there are as there are in cities, the more the virus can spread. But if you look at a vector-borne diseases like malaria, it's quite different. When the mosquito takes a blood meal that transmits this protozoan parasite, the malarial parasite, it has to stop and digest. And so if you present to the mosquito another potential susceptible host, there's nothing it can do because it's busy digesting. And so as you increase the number, the density, if you like, the number of people, that doesn't necessarily increase the transmissibility. And in fact as the population grows, the relative rate of transmission goes down. And so they thought that was a very interesting point to make because people might be wondering why it is that not all transmissible diseases are worse in urban centers or high-density.So that was his first point. The second point I thought was really cool and had to do with, if you like, the biomechanics of flying mammals, in this case bats. So bats, like all flying mammals, have to have particularly light bones. And a consequence of that is that there's less of a volume of bone marrow, and bone marrow is where B cells of the immune system are synthesized. And the B cells create antibodies that create the inflammation that creates the pathology. And so bats, by virtue of being volant mammals, flying mammals, are actually in some sense, naturally more resistant to immune pathology. So that was a really interesting point. He then went on to make another point about bats, which was every time a bat flies, in some sense it's generating a mini fever. And high body temperature, as everyone knows, is one way that physiology has invented to rid ourselves of infection.So the bat is in some sense generating this fever every time it flies and killing off any viruses or some number that it might be infected with. And the third thing about bats is that they enter into what's called torpor. And torpor is a little mini hibernation where they have very reduced activity and that naturally socially isolates the bat. So in its natural repertoire of behaviors, it has built into it in some sense a natural means of combating viral infection that we do not. And that goes some way to explaining why bats don't suffer as much as humans.Now, Andy's final point is actually the most technical and most frightening. Every species that gets infected with a virus has a natural epidemic cycle. And the factors that contribute to that cycle are things like how long they live, how quickly they reproduce, and so forth. And small mammals reproduce more quickly and have shorter lifespans, and large mammals conversely reproduce slowly and have longer lifespans. And that means our epidemic cycles are slow relative to a bat.Now as long as we have separate, largely uncoupled life histories, that's fine. But now if you increase the transmission between species to a level that you would observe within the species, something very alarming happens, and that is that the faster epidemic cycle dominates the slower one—which means that the bat species could drive the human species extinct, because we would be living in some sense on the timescale of a bat population. So in this case we kind of dodged a bullet because even though it's dreadful, there was in some sense one or a few points of contact, but if human beings persist in the stupidity of engaging at a high rate, through whatever means of transmission, with nonhuman species such as the bat population, then there's a real prospect of a far worse entangling of the epidemic cycles potentially leading to a very significant reduction in the human population.MichaelYeah, this is an interesting place to enter the question of what you brought up last week, in terms of intentionally misaligning phenomena occurring at different scales, uncoupling systems that are operating at different scales, and this I think also touches on Rajiv’s paper. We'll discuss later, as you know, we’re looking at the epidemic timescale in bats, the epidemic timescale in humans, but then also the way that this epidemic is rippling through our economic systems and so on. There are a lot of areas where we either want to drive them apart or we are forced to align timescales to shift our economy in order to make it sort of work with the human epidemic timescale. But that's getting ahead of ourselves.DavidWell, no, I think it's a really important point you make as, as I'm not sure everyone understands or knows, SFI has been for a long time fascinated with this topic of “complex time,” which is how temporal phenomena play out across the scales of the complexity of the earth. And what evolution has done is it's created this interesting coupling of all of these clocks. You can think of every species as being a little clock that ticks away at its own rate and we interact at some level, but we're not strongly coupled. And if we strongly couple, then you get these strange synchronizations that appear. And in this case, the synchronization is dominated by the fastest clock. And in the case of transmission, that could be a lethal synchronization.MichaelSo to get back to the core of this series and the dynamics of transmission. Let's talk about Michael Hochberg’s piece.DavidYeah. Michael is in some sense is doing what John did last week in presenting us with the intuitions of a simple model. And the intuition that he's trying to instill, which we have a very hard time with, is exponential thinking. Human beings are basically by default linear thinkers. You double the size of that, you double the effect, you know. It takes twice as long, you know, and it's twice the effort. But in the exponential regime, that's not true. These nonlinearities dominate. And the one that Michael focuses on is again, this enigmatic quantity that everyone is talking about, but in England we call “R naught.” But here we call “R sub zero,” which is the number of new infections caused by a primary infection. So if I were infected, how many other people I would infect. And we know that for this particular virus, that value is about 2.5 so a primary infection would cause about 2.5 secondaries, which leads to a doubling of the virus about every three days.What that means in large populations is really kind of staggering and it bears on this whole question that we discussed on coming out of quarantine. So if the initial size, if you like, of the infected population is in the hundreds, in a population of millions as we live in, then thousands of people will be infected. But if the initial population of infected is in the hundreds of thousands, then the total number afflicted will be in the millions. And so this gets back to this crucial insight that because of the nonlinearity and this doubling effect, as we come out of isolation, it's crucial that we don't expose the world to a very large number of what might be non-symptomatic infected, because we're going to get these nonlinear effects, which lead to millions of people becoming infected.MichaelYeah. There's another number here, the the effective reproduction number R(t). I've been hearing people confuse these two numbers. I think it's important to differentiate. This is what you're talking about is the R naught gives you the transmissibility on day zero, but when we're actually looking at how it lands in these different populations, it's not just the size as as we talked about with Laurent Hébert-Dufresne different on an earlier episode. It's not just the size, it's also the structure, but let's set that aside for a moment and talk a little bit about how R(t) is different from R naught.DavidYeah. The difference is essentially they're very similar concepts, but R naught, as you said, is in a way the concept that we worry about at t=0 when the infection starts, but while the infection is moving along, there's also a reproductive rate of the virus, that's time-variant as the epidemic proceeds. So it's not necessarily just what happens at the beginning that we should be concerned about, but what's happening as the infection unfolds. But they are to all intensive purposes, very similar because they all reflect this effect of the instantaneous current population size on the future epidemic size.MichaelYeah. It seems like one key point to take away from that, though, is that when people hear other people talking about lowering the R value for this virus, they're not talking about actually changing the virus itself to become less transmissible. You're talking about network dynamics.DavidExactly. That’s absolutely right. They all play into that calculation of of R zero or R, and as we said last week, there's been so much emphasis on the molecular biology that we've forgotten that the social distancing measures are an essential parameter in the epidemic modeling.MichaelSo a little bit later this week, we have a conversation with Caroline Buckee coming out, and she's published quite a bit recently on disease surveillance using modern techniques. You know, this is a modern pandemic and so it's a pandemic happening in a world of data surveillance, happening at multiple different scales, and there are a lot of really interesting both technical and ethical questions that come up from that. But one of the reasons that it's such a hot topic is because it would allow us to potentially detect these things a lot earlier than we did this time. Or to be able to respond to them in a much more precise and granular way. So that that brings us to Miguel Fuentes’ piece on “The use of social media data to detect signatures of global crises.” What'd you think about this one?DavidYeah, this was very interesting and it had that really spooky epigraph from HP Lovecraft, right? Which is, “The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.”MichaelWhich speaks to last week's entire conversation on rigorous uncertainty.DavidIt absolutely does. And our desire to do anything in our power to pretend that the unknown is not unknown. What their contribution is, what they've been doing in fact for the last several years, is studying social unrest in their own home nation of Chile. And the question that they ask themselves is, what is the signature of social crisis? And they're interested in that largely because they want to detect it before it unfolds. And they've been studying social media, in particular tweets and Twitter feeds, and they made an interesting discovery. In retrospect I think it's pretty obvious, but I think it might not have been before the analysis was performed. And that is, during periods of high crisis—that is during marches, during demonstration, during periods of significant civil unrest—if you look at the social graph, if you like, or the social network that you can reconstruct from tweets who sends messages to whom and so forth, you observe that during crisis, that graph has a very particular top logical structure. And that structure is that messages are very clique-ish and they center around a very small number of dominant themes, dominant terms of course, or keywords or tags. And so the graph kind of fragments and the particular reach of any particular person in that social media graph is limited. As you move into periods of low crisis, the number of terms or tags becomes more diverse and its reach increases. It extends over longer distances in the graph. And what was intriguing, I think, about their analysis of this particular dataset in Chile during the civil unrest, is that those signatures were present before people were out in the streets.It gets to our point last week, right?: that technology allows for mimetic transmission to be in advance of behavioral and biological transmission, and in just the way that we fail to act with alacrity in the presence of the data which we discovered today, for example, with much earlier maps, perhaps even in January, we knew this…that there are similar questions about social unrest and it and it raises, you know it's a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, yes, you might be able to see this. On the other hand, in whose hands is that appropriate information and how would we use it responsibly?MichaelIndeed. You know, something that I get out of this—and I'm curious to know your reflections on this—is this sounds a lot like the way that Francesco Varela described the 1973 Chilean revolution, when he spoke of turning on the radio and one radio station would say that it's sunny outside and another radio station would say it was raining. It was like a fragmentation of reality. And you know, there's, there's been a lot of research at SFI, including work by Joshua Garland, on polarization of networks on social media. Reading Fuentes’ piece, it almost reminds me of the meiotic spindle and the polarization of chromosomal pairs at the moment that we're seeing this transition—a cell’s reproductive cycle. Without suggesting that there's any kind of developmental telos here, I’m curious in relation to your earlier remarks on multiple different timescales and the way that an epidemic in a smaller organism can drive disease dynamics in a larger organism, whether you think that what Fuentes and his colleagues are observing is the network coupling two phenomena that are going on at different scales, at different paces, and attempting to adapt to accommodate that.DavidYeah, I think you're right that what's happening is, of course,  we're all now obsessed over this virus and it's rather dangerous actually. We’re becoming a memetic monoculture, the news that should be reaching us is not, and our cliqueishness with respect to ideas is shrinking and I think it's a good example of that phenomenon. What’s surprising, I think when one performs these analyses of the kind that Miguel has, and Josh and others, is that what is clear at the level of our social lives also manifests at the population level, the national level. And that's surprising. I think it's very difficult for us to project out our own psychological insights into the collective—and what the social media data is allowing us to see is these echoes, if you like, of the micro in the macro. And it needed to be that way. But in this case it does seem to be the case that as we become, in some sense, more narrow in our obsessions, so does culture at large.MichaelTo explore this a little bit further, I just read a really fascinating essay about the Thirty Years’ War: the Anabaptists holing up in Munster fighting the Catholic Church, and the way that the fragmentation of Christianity across Europe was driven by the circulation of pamphlets due to the recently invented printing press and the way that, this was an early modern information explosion that led to a phenomenon that Fuentes would call a “crisis,” in the way that you know it bears this kind of signature in its networks. We talked a lot in the first episode about the way that the social contagion dimensions lay over this and make this, again, like a distinctly information-age pandemic. That period in the 16th century, 17th centuries… We’re going to talk about Melanie Mitchell's work on analogies here in a little bit, and I'm curious to what degree you might find that particular period of polarization and loss of collective narrative coherence as a useful analogy or guide for what's going on now—and then moving into Rajiv's piece with Danielle and Glen, what does that suggest in terms of our options for recovery?DavidYeah. So if we look at the article by Rajiv, Glen, and Danielle, what this is saying at the broadest level is that we have to be equally as sophisticated in the treatment of the socioeconomic networks as we are coming to be in the treatment of the social epidemiological networks. And again, it gets to last week—we’re so accustomed to these reductionist forms of thought where we look for these magic bullets at the genetic level, that we've become blinded to the fact that they're by and large useless at the level of the collective, and we need new insights, which is in part what complexity tries to do. What they are proposing in their article is something in some sense, in retrospect, very obvious—which is that we need a multiple timescale approach to this crisis that makes most effective use of confinement testing and mobilization. And they call their strategy “mobilize-to-transition.”The basic concept of mobilize-to-transition is while we are in confinement is the time when we should be maximizing virological and serological testing in order to move the either resistant or immune subset of the population back into the economy. So we don't wait for the wave of the pandemic to subside. You actually are actively mobilizing now while in confinement. And the point that they make, which I think is the most important, has to do with this question of technological certification—because everyone's asking this question: “If I tested negative and I returned into work, well how do you know that I haven't been infected the meantime? Right? Because I've been exposed to any number of people by coming back to work and we can't be absolutely sure everyone is still negative.” Now with serological testing, with antibodies, we're more secure because we hope you have persistent immunity and that's where technology comes in.And so they are suggesting we need to develop new technologies, which certify negative-tested or serological positives that are reliable and can be accessed by other individuals. So it’s as if, Michael, we both came into a room and I looked at my phone and it said, “Yes, you can talk to Michael because he's a safe contact,” but you can again note how frightening that might be with respect to security. So I think the bigger question that they're raising is, yes, we need the sophisticated schedule of social change. We need a technological means of certification and we need to be sophisticated about the robustness of that certification.MichaelThere's another piece here which ties into—if people heard Rajiv's episode of this podcast when he was here talking about stereotyping and criminal justice, and he was talking about the imbalanced distribution of stop and search that certain groups are targeted due to ethnicity for discriminatory police action. And he uses that as an interesting metaphor here, to explain what we want to tune this process of testing for, in terms of optimizing for a best distribution of testing. Why don’t you talk about that a little bit?DavidWell, now, this just gets to this point again, it's very general. I'm not sure we have a good answer to this. Which is what you don't want, right? Is all of these biases built into your process because you think you know who the highest-risk individuals are. So in some sense you have to spread your survey much wider than your prior beliefs might lead you to. And my take away from Rajiv's point on that is that we have to be extremely aware of how we use historical bias to inform future survey, and that the best thing we could possibly do is know it in order to adopt a more uniform sampling strategy.MichaelYeah. He says, “If a location is turning up more positives than another at the margin, resources would be better used by shifting to the former at the expense of the latter.” So this is about reallocation of testing through a dynamic process that's provisional and under constant revision. You know, something else that came up around this paper on Twitter is people's discomfort around the idea. Nowhere in this paper does it say that people will be forcibly reallocated into different labor sectors. But of course when you're operating on a fraction of the workforce and there's been a massive shift in the composition of goods and services in economic demand, then it's clear that reallocation is going to happen, but it's going to happen, as they make clear in this, among those who are willing and able. And so this is another piece that I'd like to hear you speak to, which is how this kind of process is going to emerge naturally, rather than being forced in a kind of top down way. That you can't do that with a system like this.DavidYeah, but this gets to David Kinney's contribution of last week having to do with the limitations of scientists’ insight into policy advice, which is that what Rajiv is saying—very correctly—is there are statistical anomalies that come from these biased samples, and that there are techniques to actively avoid them. In his case, do the inverse, which is one way to do it. But then it leads to your question, which is a policy question, which is how do we then use that kind of insight?And I have to say, I mean it's one of those cases where it's certainly above my pay grade. I would say it would be my job and the job of our community to be as rigorous as we can with the limitations of the survey and suggesting improvements to harvesting the true information. At that point, we really have to turn to democratically elected officials to make difficult decisions, and to the citizens of the country who elect them. So I'm always very careful about stepping into that domain because I wasn't elected for my sociopolitical wisdom. I was elected for my scientific capability.MichaelThat is a fair caution. What it seems like though is that there is a scientific opportunity here to investigate how the timescale at which people can be retrained suits the timescale at which people are going to be reentering the workforce, and gives us some insight… You know, like when, Maria del-Rio Chanona, Doyne Farmers’ PhD student, came out for the symposium last year and was discussing looking at networks of skills rather than at job descriptions and looking at how we might be able to help people see this in a fresh way by unbundling all of the different capacities that people have. Now that kind of work seems like it would be really useful in advising policymakers on recommendations for retraining and that kind of thing.DavidYeah, I do think that one thing we've learned in pedagogy is how vastly more flexible human minds are than we thought. And all of us when motivated have an extraordinary latent capability to learn. And so on that side of the equation, I think yes, but you know, as you are, I'm extraordinarily concerned about despotic moves during periods of crisis. They're very hard to undo. And so I would be extremely cautious in giving individuals in political power that instrument to dictate what people should be doing with their lives.MichaelTo the point on plasticity and people being able to change the way that we think about something, that leads us very gracefully into Melanie Mitchell's piece on analogy.DavidYeah. So this was really a wonderful, thoughtful and very witty contribution having to do with how we struggle to conceptualize a moment like this, and how we're forced to reach for analogies to make sense of it because it seems so unprecedented. And of course Melanie had worked on artificial intelligence systems with Doug Hofstadter to try and draw analogies. So she has a really interesting background in this topic. The first analogy that Melanie mentioned. to flu. And many people and many of us actually were quite confused by the situation because flu, as most people know, infects hundreds of thousands of us citizens a year. That leads to tens of thousands of deaths. Why is it that the coronavirus had a much stronger systemic effect than the flu virus? And one obvious answer to that is, because we knew the flu virus and and society doesn't like uncertainty, as we have established.  Just the novelty alone was enough to lead to a strong reaction.But more importantly, other details of its biology that the coronavirus is more virulent, it's more transmissible. And that means that the rate at which society is being perturbed is higher. And this led to one interesting and amusing quote from someone with a comedic capability, in her article, who said facetiously, “I do not understand how McDonald's can serve 2 billion hamburgers every year, but when I order 5 million at the drive through, it overwhelms the system.” Right? So it's a very important point made there. And is the difference between number and number over time, right? And rate. And the problem, the difference between flu, if you like, and coronavirus is not the number. The problem is the rate.And she then goes on to talk about these other analogies that we draw, you know that we're in the throws of a tsunami.  This is a wave that hasn't crested yet. And the question is what's behind that analogy? And I think what's behind that one is our awareness of something with immense power that we're not aware of until it's too late. That is, in a sense, if you unpack what is meant by a tsunami, that's what's meant—in contrast to a quote that she has from The New York Times where someone says it's like asking a fireman when you can move back into your house, but your house is still on fire. And that's completely different, right? Because that's an inadequate grasp of the risks of a common event. And what that analogy is saying is, “Get real.”She goes on to develop all of these analogies. And the one that's in some sense, most alarming in reference to our earlier conversation, is the analogy to war. That the pandemic is our war, the war of our time, perhaps World War Three, and with leaders, including presidents and prime ministers referring to themselves as wartime leaders, as wartime presidents. What is behind that analogy? Well, on the one hand it’s a positive that we all have to cooperate. We all have to work together to solve this. We all have to make sacrifices. But there's also a very significant negative. And that is that during a war there is a reduction in civil liberties, and the question we're asking ourselves is, during this so-called war, are we cooperating or are we being controlled? And that's the question when we should ask. So the analogy is not benign, right? It carries with it both positives and negatives and Melanie's deep point is, we should all be very thoughtful about both of those, because they're going to change our behavior in the long run.MichaelThere's an entry through this article to a deeper and broader topic in complex systems thinking generally, which is that these analogies are informal verbal models. You know, SFI External Professor Scott E. Page and his book The Model Thinker. It seems like a kind of adaptation to the information explosion that we were talking about earlier in this call. To try and sort of fortify that an analogy with the printing press, you know this was something that gave people the capacity for peer review. It was a technological innovation that enabled modern science, by a lot of historical accounts, and in some way that's sort of the press was the cause of and solution to the information crisis. So in this sense, at risk of going on a digression I'll have to cut out later…DavidI can answer actually.MichaelYeah!DavidI think you make a really important point, which is that in some sense, what we do when we build mathematical models or models of any kind is make analogies. If you look at the early theories of the solar system and the cosmos, they were based on clocks, right? In other words, mechanical devices, we used to model the motions of the planets, and so hence we have our armillary spheres and astrolabes and all of these extraordinary devices that are in some sense embodied physical analogies. And you're right, say that we should understand that because what your brain is doing when someone says this is like a tsunami, is you are in some folkloric sense invoking fluid dynamics. You're saying, “I know what a wave is. I know how they're propagated. I have an understanding of the force behind them. I understand what happens when they reach shallow ground and a wave breaks.” So you have in your mind a mechanical picture of a dynamical system. It's just that you are not writing it down rigorously in mathematical terms. But your brain is using a similar understanding of mechanics, and it's a very natural extension in fact from the verbal analogy to the mathematical model. So it's actually one of the very powerful things that the brain does, and it allows us to arrive at insights without doing a considerable amount of formal work.MichaelThe question that Melanie's calling us to hear I think is really important, which is,  not all models are created equal. There may be moments where the complexity of the situation calls for a kind of holding together of multiple models to get a stereoscopic view, to see things knowing that each model is hiding crucial aspects of the situation, and suggesting things that we don't want, like you mentioned, you know, the wartime footing tends to lead to xenophobia and so on. So these are different stories in a sense that are inhabiting a kind of evolutionary landscape. And some of these models are really robust and ancient, and some aren't. And in communicating them, some of them are simple enough to be effectively communicated, but like we were talking about in the last episode, the most encompassing complete model may be dependent on data that we don't have or may overfit a rapidly changing situation. So I think this really speaks to the issue of careful science communication, here.DavidWell yeah, again, this analogy concept and the relationship to models is very deep. I mean we could all sit down, it might be an interesting exercise in fact, and say, okay, let's take the three analogies that are in play here, “war,” “tsunami,” and “fire.” And if you were to sit down and just write down a list of what those things implied and which one we thought was the best fit to our circumstance, it's quite interesting. Right? War typically has relatively equally matched adversaries who have strategic interests that are being in some sense reached for through conflict, typically territorial expansion. Does that fit this circumstance or not? And I think it's a very interesting exercise, because language is so seductive and so infectious, and sentences are so easy to repeat, we often forget that they carry specific meanings. I think that Melanie's contribution is asking us to consider what those meanings really are.MichaelIndeed. Well that's a fine place to wrap it for this one, unless you have…DavidNo, I think that's really great. I thought I might mention briefly what we're going to be dealing with next week.MichaelLet's do it.DavidSo just again, another batch of five really interesting thoughtful pieces. We will have a contribution on investment. What is the right thing to do in a market such as this? And of course Bill Miller will be making that contribution, our former Chairman of the Board and obviously a very well known investor. And of course Bill is always extraordinarily brave and says now is the time to take risks. We’ll have contributions from virologists in Spain who are on the front line of repurposing basic science virus labs to create PCR-based tests, all the way through to paleontologists like Doug Erwin, who is going to be discussing what we can learn from the history of mass extinctions in the fossil record and their recoveries.MichaelDoug's always great for the gallows humor that you can only get from a paleontologist who studies mass extinctions.DavidEverything pales in comparison to their dataset!MichaelYeah! It’s also worth mentioning, I think that the InterPlanetary Festival, which has unfortunately but understandably been canceled, has been working on a series of online course materials around this essay series and this podcast. And you can go and sign up for weekly PDFs with all kinds of fun supplementary material at interplanetaryfest.org. It’s been lovely, when we're talking about the spontaneous and self-organizing reallocation of labor, it’s been great to see that team pumping out these materials. They're really, really good.DavidYeah, they're great. And I would just suggest, for those of you who have kids or are looking for something to discuss in confinement with your families and going a little stir crazy, what this does, and I think the InterPlanetary team done a great job, is it takes a lot of these Transmissions, renders them in a more accessible language, and couples them to quizzes so that you can all discuss some of these topics and do something hopefully constructive rather than all losing your minds.MichaelLearning it multiple scales at once. All right, David, it's a pleasure. Looking forward to catching up with you on the next set next week. Fantastic.DavidThank you, Michael. Thanks everyone. Be safe.
27,Episode Details / Transcript MichaelShall we just dive in? CarolineYup. Yup. MichaelExcellent. Caroline Buckee, thank you so much for joining us on Complexity Podcast. CarolineThank you for having me. MichaelSo there are two pieces that touch on issues you brought up in the SFI Flash Seminar we hosted last week that would be really worth discussing. It’s two papers we'll link to in the show notes. One is a letter that you coauthored for Science on, “Aggregated mobility data could help fight Covid-19.” The other is a letter that you wrote for The Lancet improving epidemic surveillance and response, “Big data is dead long live big data.” Quite the name! CarolineI actually wrote that before this outbreak, and subsequently modified it to include reference to COVID because it's so pertinent right now. MichaelIndeed. Yeah. You know, let's just jump into it. I think the right place to start is with the state of epidemic surveillance as it is now. And I think it's worth, before we get into the specific problems that you bring up in the, in the Science piece, talking about how we were actually doing disease surveillance at the end of 2019 in the beginning of 2020, and what does that really look like? What are the sources and how are they being employed? CarolineSure. So I think, so the first thing to say is that there's a big difference between routine surveillance for infections that we already have diagnostic capabilities and programs and so on, versus surveillance for an emerging infection that we don't know anything about. So surveillance systems are in place for many different kinds of infectious diseases and other diseases. And those have kind of different types of data collection methods and, you know, different diagnostics and different reporting mechanisms and so on. For an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19, what starts out happening at the beginning is just going to be a handful or cluster of weird looking disease in a particular place. Right? So in terms of surveillance, what that looks like and what it looked like in this context, was strange pneumonia that started to happen associated with a particular time and place. So in this case, a wet market in Wuhan. And what unusual is, unusual looking pneumonia in a lot of patients, will depend on what your baseline is, and how well you can detect an uptick in unusual symptoms.And then of course our ability to detect it is also going to depend on, how much the symptoms from a new disease look like. Other symptoms that we already understand. So in this case, a fever and a cough for example, is fairly nonspecific. And for surveillance systems in general, this is often an issue. For many, many diseases, we won't have a diagnostic test, we'll just have patterns of, for example, influenza-like illness. And we'll try to infer what's happening with it with transmission of a particular disease, from patterns of fever or other types of symptoms rather than confirmed cases that are circulating in different places over time. So the first thing to say, I think, is that the state of surveillance for an emerging disease is by definition going to rely on symptoms and being able to tell the difference between an unusual cluster of patients with particular symptoms versus a baseline.So in global terms, that's kind of how we're going to first detect something unusual happening. Now our ability to track and monitor the spread of an epidemic depends on how well we're measuring cases and that has a whole bunch of different features to it. So in this context, fairly quickly, it was identified that this was a coronavirus, but in other contexts, the etiology, which is what the actual underlying pathogen is that's causing a disease, may not be known initially. So that's the first thing, right? Is trying to figure out what's causing the disease. And that happened fairly early for this one. We knew fairly early on that it was a coronavirus of some kind. Being able to track it then depends on how well we're able to capture cases within a surveillance system. So the whole debacle with testing really emphasizes the importance of this piece, of being able to track the outbreak because testing has been slow to ramp up—and that's understandable for a new disease cause you need to develop a quick diagnostic test because it's been slow to ramp up.That means that we're not sure how many cases are occurring in different places in different times. And already that makes it quite difficult to figure out how quickly it might spread, you know, estimate the basic parameters of the disease, like the reproduction number and so on. And in the context of this outbreak—and this is true for quite a few different diseases—we also think that there's a huge number of mild cases and cases that don't have any symptoms at all. And so of course in a normal surveillance system, you're not going to capture those people, because they won't be tested, because they won't be showing up at the clinic or the hospital. So again, you have different types of biases both from a testing capacity standpoint and from the epidemiological standpoint where you're just not capturing a lot of cases because people are either home sick but they're not going to hospital and they're not been captured or they may not have symptoms.So again, that's why the surveillance aspect is quite tricky at the beginning and it remains a big challenge in this epidemic. What you do with that data on how many cases there are and where is then going to depend on the kind of infectious disease it is, what kinds of interventions you have available for an emerging infectious disease. Non-pharmaceutical interventions are often are only available tools before we have treatments and vaccines which require of course a huge scale-up of pharmaceutical capacity and randomized controlled trials to establish what's going to work. So that's why social distancing is one of the only tools we have at the beginning of a scary epidemic like this, to shut down transmission sufficiently to give us some time to figure out how to combat the disease itself. MichaelYeah, just this morning in the SFI in-house emails, Geoffrey West shared this thing that some of the listeners may have seen going around suggesting that this novel coronavirus is like the Schrodinger's virus because you both have to act as though you have it and that you don't have it. This is a profound uncertainty that we're all acting under here, which gets to this other piece and I want to, we'll put a pin in that for later, but I think you brought us right up to the lip of the concern around when we really only have network interventions when we really can't do effective contact tracing, when we really don't know who has already had and recovered at the resolution that we would like. CarolineWe have contact tracing. In fact places like South Korea and Singapore did a very effective contact tracing program, and actually we wrote a paper where we showed that in combination with social distancing contact tracing, aggressive case finding, can be very effective actually. So it's not that we can't do contact tracing, but we certainly don't have pharmaceutical interventions just now. So contact tracing is one of a suite of tools that will be helpful in, in combination with social distancing more broadly. MichaelYou're talking about the piece that you did with Kahn, Grad, Childs, et cetera. CarolineYeah. Corey Peak is the first author. MichaelYes indeed. We'll link to that one. Bringing it back around to the use of mobility data and how this brings us into an ethical discussion… A lot of the conversations I've been having about COVID-19 are about how in a sense, it didn't just infect us as individuals; it revealed to us by breaking all of these other global networks, supply chains and so on,  it showed us the vulnerabilities in those networks. And one of the vulnerabilities that you address in both of these writings, although at different angles, is in places where we don't have sort of modularity built into the structure. In one of those cases it's how we aggregate data. I'm thinking about Albert Kao's work on modular decision-making and how local aggregations coarse grain things. So in this case, it's about anonymizing data at the level of individual people, but still providing useful information to people at different points at county, state, national-level decision structures.The obvious question is this, you know, thinking about disease surveillance brings up all kinds of issues with privacy and so on. I'd love to hear how you and your colleagues have been thinking through this. CarolineSo just to back up to your first point about global connectivity and supply chains. So I think absolutely this has brought home to people what epidemiologists already knew, which is that we live in a global community and depending on the epidemiology of a disease, we are not immune to global outbreaks. I think the supply chain issue is very interesting, and one of the things that we're seeing that's worrying me is that there's disruption to the humanitarian aid supply. And that's going to have a huge impact on low and middle income countries that rely on, for example, a distribution of food and other humanitarian aid, and how they're going to be able to manage that. And it's an interesting scenario. So in Vanuatu right now, there's a tropical cyclone coming and they're going to probably need international aid. But there's a possibility that those international actors will bring COVID-19 to Vanuatu with them.And what's more, when you have a natural disaster, everybody shelters in place and they're all crowded together. So that promotes the spread of the disease. So there's all kinds of interconnectedness, that happens not just in terms of the initial outbreak and people traveling around, but also as you point supply chain. And then this issue of international aid and humanitarian interventions that we need to continue. And how do we think through those types of connectivity patterns. So that's one thing. Just to mention that I think that we really need to think about this. think through some of the factors for low income settings where the reality is that the elderly populations there are lower than they are in the Western world. And so in fact from a disease standpoint, the trade offs that they're having to make with respect to humanitarian issues, food, routine vaccination, some of those are going to be… Well I should say, they may have to make different types of decisions about what they want to do with respect to COVID-19 because of the way that their societies are set up and their demographic distributions and their reliance on global supply of a different kind. Does that make sense? MichaelYeah.CarolineIn respect to privacy. So I think the most important thing to emphasize here is that there's a very important distinction between apps that we're seeing designed for contact tracing, which are individual level data, and they are designed specifically to try and look at chains of transmission to aid contact tracing programs. In contrast, the type of data that we've been working with is aggregated to the extent that it's no longer human subjects research for example. So we've done this work for quite a long time. And the principle behind the aggregation that happens is that you want the lowest resolution. So the courses spatial scale at which you can still say something useful. And if it's the case that the spatial scale needs to be on a smaller spatial scale or higher resolution for you to be able to say anything sensible then we don't do that.So under the DUAs and the kind of privacy protocols that we have in place, re-identification is a big deal and we really take that seriously. So the aggregated data itself tells you something much more general than these contact tracing apps. And what it tells you is kind of generally what's happening, how far are people going when they're traveling around, how much movement is there? And that's roughly related to the contact rate within an epidemiological model. We don't really know yet exactly how those two things are linked mechanistically, but once we have better data on COVID transmission in different places coupled with specific policies being put in place, we should be able to start to disentangle what these aggregated mobility metrics mean for social distancing. And the reason that that's really important is that down the road we're going to need evidence if we're going to make decisions about how to relax social distancing on the other side of this epidemic. Without having a way to monitor social distancing interventions and understand what that will do in terms of transmission, we won't be able to relax them based on data. We'll be guessing. So again, that's going to be really key, especially if we're going to be in a scenario where we have to go into lockdown multiple times, which is one possible scenario for the future. So we really need to start measuring this in a sensible way. MichaelThe episode that came out just before this one was with David Krakauer discussing the first few submissions for the SFI Transmission article series. The theme linking all of the first five articles in that series had to do with this issue of the correct resolution of the model and deciding at what point you're making the trade-off. Where are the most effective trade-offs made between an honest account of the spread of probabilities to the actionability of the knowledge itself. So that links, I think,  this work on aggregating mobility data to this other piece that you wrote for The Lancet, which addresses this issue in a lot of ways. One of which is that right now epidemiology is a crisis discipline where you're working these things out in real time. And much as a Rajiv Sethi mentioned and an early episode of this show, talking about the way that we run models of one another in the criminal justice context, you know, if you meet someone in a dark alley, you don't have a lot of time to make a decision about them. And that's where all of these implicit biases come out.And there's a similar thing going on right now, when we meet the coronavirus in a dark alley. We have to figure out what degree we are clustering versus treating these cases as unique cases. And so this piece of yours, I think it's good to start where you started, on the urgency of better surveillance systems, but you also bring in these three other points about three other very crucial challenges to this. I'd love to hear you lay those out. CarolineSure. So for several years now there have been discussions around the use of different kinds of data to inform surveillance and to react when epidemics happen. So you know, data from phones is one of them, the one that I know the best, but there's lots of different kinds of discussions around how corporate-owned data could be useful for forecasting. So in that article I really discussed some of the barriers, over and above the privacy concerns, which I think are very real and are being addressed currently.I think the incentive structures are all misaligned for this to be implemented in a routine way, although I've been really surprised and pleased by this response. I think we've started to see these collaborative networks being built and hopefully they will continue to be incentivized in a way that's sustainable into the future. But so incentive structures, academic incentive structures, are not really great for translational work. And then corporate data sharing, there's all kinds of issues with that. And then of course for governments it's a risky game to try and do a massive data sharing. And there are lots of different types of priorities that they have. So just to say that everyone's got their own agenda and that's challenging when you're trying to build out these analytics pipelines.The other point I made in the article was that at the moment there's a very much a separation between the methodological and high-tech world in which some of these methods are being developed, and the realities for the most vulnerable communities and the populations who are actually dealing with the implementation of surveillance on the ground. And are going to be the frontline when it comes to first detecting and then responding to epidemics.Really, I was thinking about Ebola in the article because I think that highlights it well. You know, there's a lot of scientists in high-income settings who think through problems very far away from the people who are going to have to implement them. And so in the article, I argue for a shift in the focus of intellectual and methodological work down the kind of translational pipeline and to the geographies where many of these challenges are being dealt with. So that's another thing.And then the last thing I was talking about that I think relates to what you mentioned before about the previous podcast… There's a sort of a divide in the modelling community, I think, that reflects attention between simple mechanistic models and very granular, detailed agent based models, and what their utility is for different types of scenario planning versus making quick decisions during an epidemic.And I argue in the Lancet letter that for emerging epidemics, often the simplest models are the best or the most useful, because they're transparent, and they can be quick and easily translated. I think for this outbreak, one thing that modellers always have to grapple with is whether the uncertainty in your model parameters and model structure outweigh the utility of having a very detailed agent-based model, right? So if you have a very detailed agent-based model, but you have huge amounts of uncertainty in the basic epidemiological parameters of the disease, it's not clear to me how useful that will be, right? Not to mention it's highly computationally intensive.In contrast, a very simple model is limited in what it can, it can manage to tell you because by definition it's simple. On the other hand, you can clearly explain the major uncertainties in your parameters and in the model structure. And you can see very quickly the types of broad qualitative impacts some of those uncertainties are gonna have on different types of intervention. And so I think, well, the spectrum of model complexity maybe useful for different kinds of response and different kinds of research playing into different policy decisions. Right now there's a huge amount of uncertainty in the basic parameters. And I think one of the biggest ones is how many people are asymptomatic. And by that I mean never symptomatic. It could be a substantial fraction. And that's an uncertainty in the model that's very hard to account for unless you have serological data on how many people have antibodies to the virus. Some of these other parameters have become more clear as the epidemic has progressed, but still there are big questions about that in particular that I think I'm making detailed predictions difficult.The other thing that's very uncertain is what impact will these social distancing interventions are having on the contact rate. And that's something that we will hopefully start to be able to parameterize a bit more as we move further into this epidemic. But right now, again, it's quite hard to parameterize… If you imagine an agent based-model with people moving around, it's quite hard to know really what's happening now in terms of the contact rate. So linking that to a prediction or a forecast is extremely challenging. So again, I think that the simple models are pretty good for general scenario planning, getting a quick idea for what's going on and highlighting the major uncertainties in some of the parameters. Whereas the agent-based models can obviously give you a lot more granular resolution on particular kinds of question. But I think there's a huge amount of uncertainty associated with that right now. MichaelLet's wheel this back for a moment to the first challenge that you laid out, which is the misalignment of incentives in public-private partnerships with respect to this kind of an urgent situation. I've actually been really impressed—like you said, this particular run, it's been kind of inspiring to see academics and corporations and governments working together as well as they have. But it does call into question not just policies around corporate and governmental data sharing, but also the timescale at which academic research is normally conducted. And I'm curious how you see these things shifting in an adaptation to the crisis and what kind of hopeful developments you've observed on that front. CarolineYeah. So, the timescale issue is a big one because obviously, if you look at NIH grants that many of us rely on, the turnaround time… I would say that the turnaround time is long for good reasons because we want peer review and so forth. But I think it's fairly extreme if you think about epidemics and how we respond to them. So the turnaround time is long. There's also the incentives in academia are also misaligned in the sense that we are still incentivized in terms of promotion based on first and last authorship and these types of archaic metrics, which don't reflect how science works these days. So now if you look at the papers that are coming out on COVID-19 and you look at the people actually doing the science, these are big team efforts, right? These are consortia of modellers and virologists and clinicians and they're working together to come up with a solution. And I think that has to be a shift in both how we allocate credit to scientists in those big teams and how we think about funding. So PI, single PI-led grants and things like that I think are just not going to be conducive to being able to push out this kind of work. The other thing I would say is that, you know, so for example, the MIDAS Network was funding centers of modellers and other collaborators with the express purpose of developing methods that could then be deployed during an epidemic. And I think what you've seen in the U S response is that that network has been absolutely central, like really central to, responding to this challenge and doing the science and rolling out models and everything. So those centers are about to lose funding and I hope that this epidemic will prove to the powers that be that actually, we need to invest in those kinds of centers. We need to give academics sustainable funding to do the slow methodological work, and then to have the flexibility to respond when the pandemic hits. So that's one thing and I hope that we will be able to use this to to showcase how science works now and get it funded in a more appropriate way.As far as the corporate side, I think there's still some evidence that there are kind of competitive forces at work that aren't necessarily helpful for data sharing more broadly. We also have seen a number of corporate and other actors generating models and stepping in to be the interface with state governments on their response, and I think this pandemic shouldn't be seen as an opportunity to monetize. I feel that very strongly and I worry that given the current economic setup, we're still seeing evidence that those types of competitive and profit-driven motives are evident in this response. And I think it's really important that as a society we think about that moving forward, because that strikes me as potentially quite problematic. MichaelHmm. This seems like it ties into a question that I had for you that you put under the third challenge, the methodological challenge with respect to uncertainty here. For me, there's, there's something about the way that this pandemic is unfolding that is distinctly information age, right? When we had a Laurent Hébert-Dufresne, when we had Sam Scarpino on the show, both of them were talking about complex contagions that involve both biological as well as informational social components, in terms of how people are understanding it, making sense of it, behaving in regard to that. All of this seems somewhat structurally similar to the Thirty Years War, right? Like the way that a lot of the structures for how we would normally verify information are themselves going through a crisis. And we're seeing a lot of competition at the level of people without what we would think of as normal credentials stepping forward to, in terms of the printing press… The analogy is like their own version of Christianity, their own version of epidemiology. And on the one hand, this is really inspiring. You're seeing people step up en masse. But in another sense, you make the case in this Lancet article that it's really dangerous because what's happening now is that we have a lot of people who, when the barrier to entry to participation in modelling and sharing this information has been lowered like it has, there’s a narrative collapse. It becomes very difficult to coordinate action. People are buying models from people that aren't really authorized or they lack the expertise. Disinformation and misinformation are rampant and it's a tricky thing, right? Because on the one hand, we do need to be able to move fast enough to do this, but it's unclear how to move fast enough and still be able to apply the brakes when necessary, or steer it. CarolineYeah. I mean, I think the specific point I was making the article was that you can't get away from needing solid epidemiological data and solid epidemiological analysis, and good analysis… any model ultimately you need to know how many cases you have. So, there's this feeling in this world of AI and deep learning and big data that somehow we're going to be able to make up for a lack of solid epidemiological data with all these other datasets. And while I agree that if you have nothing, it's helpful to have some other sources of information to inform your estimates, but you can't replace it and you can’t ultimately make any sensible statement without these key very basic epidemiological pieces of information. So that's sort of related but a little bit tangential to what you were saying.With respect to expertise, I think the danger here… So first of all, I think people conflate forecasting, epidemiological models with forecasting the weather. You know, with this sense that if you just have a big enough computer, it's going to be fine, right? And it's not because epidemiology involves human behavior and feedback and you change the situation when human behavior changes. So if you say it's going to rain tomorrow and everyone carries an umbrella, that doesn't change the fact that it's going to rain. If you say there's going to be an outbreak tomorrow and everyone stays home from work, there's no longer an outbreak, your prediction is wrong, and everybody loses trust in your model, right? So these things are not the same. And I think it's very easy to underestimate the difficulties and the amount of expertise that you might need to make a sensible model that's actually useful.So I'm all for democratizing science and I think that that's great. The problem is whether you're using that to inform policy and how it's being communicated to the public. And there you really have to be very clear, and we've seen that with this COVID-19 outbreak where there's a lot of confusion in the media and among different levels of government about what these models really say and what they can say, what they can't say. You know, we've had the press say, “Oh, the model said this last week, and now it's saying that,” when there's no inconsistency in the modelling framework, it's just that the model under scenario X is not the same as the model under scenario Y, for example. So I think that there's a huge communication problem here that has the potential to be quite dangerous. And the rise of so-called armchair epidemiologist is part of that general attempt. People want answers, right? And so people step up.You know, there was an article yesterday in the New York times about the, the new heroes of the coronavirus outbreak and all six of them were white men. And I do think that there are gender differences in who is stepping up to have an opinion. And not just that, but there's also very big divided in terms of who's being portrayed in the media, who is coming out on TV and talking. So we talk about disinformation. I think there's also a misrepresentation and a problem there where if you look at who are the people who are coming forward to have strong opinions based on potentially not that much expertise, it's definitely has a racial and gender bias, is what I would say. MichaelSo that's contributing to a problem that you identify and prescribe with a reallocation of resources—you know, money research, et cetera—into those populations that are at risk. Those populations that are undersurveilled, those populations that are actually the stakeholders locally, the recipients of these interventions. And this is something that touches on all three points in this piece, the misalignment and the analysis pipeline, the gap between the innovation and the implementation, and then the inherent uncertainty of it all come to a head in, “Well, it would be better if, rather than trying to make a global theory of everything for the coronavirus, we looked at local solutions and then how those fit into a broader understanding and solution.It would make sense if we designed these interventions in the context of where they would actually be deployed. But you know, when I had Sam Scarpino on the show, he made the point that often the populations that are most in need are the ones about which we have the least information. Right? This ties into your, there's a misrepresentation among the heroes as well as the sort of victims in this situation. And so how could we align our incentives and reinvest when we're basically shooting blind, right? If we don't know where to put it? CarolineYeah. Well I would say so first of all, it's true that there has been a kind of neglect in terms of allocation of resources for science globally, right? And so, and that has a very distinct geographic flavor. So I think a lot of these issues, not necessarily for COVID, although for COVID as well… but being able to tailor a response in a way that is not just reflective of the situation in the US and Europe for example, but reflects the different realities around the world, different demographics, different co-morbidities, different issues for routine medical care. What you need is to invest in scientific groups in the Global South for example, we should be building centers, supporting excellent scientists who exist all across Africa and India and Bangladesh and so on. And we should be making sure that we fund centers of excellence and the researchers there who are in a much better position to be able to interface between policymakers and scientists and public health in the context that is going to be relevant for their response in a way that will ultimately protect everyone better.Given that we live in a global world, we need to think about adjusting resources for the scientific community so that they can respond where epidemics start. And that's going to be agnostic to many different factors, but right now the focus of expertise and money and funding for science for this kind of thing is in the US and Europe and Canada and places like that. We need to shift it. We need to recognize that we live in a globally connected world and we have systematically neglected funding in the Global South. And then we need to address that directly. MichaelHow do you see it as working within the United States? In Europe, for example, you know, the lowest quartile in income are the ones that both have less access to healthcare. And then also in a weird way, a kind of privacy through their disclusion from the system that would provide data on them in the first place. So how do you imagine creating flexible and distributed teams that are able to serve the poor in that regard, even within healthy nations? CarolineSo I think, the first thing is that a lot of these problems, stem from economic and political injustice against particular groups of people and the poor. And so the first thing to say is that the best thing that the government could do for those groups is to make sure that they're supported economically. Unemployment's just skyrocketing. We need to support those populations and make sure that they are at least economically looked after, as well as provided with excellent medical care and access. But I think that this data issue is really key. So one thing that we have talked about with this aggregated mobility data is the reason that we provide very coarse-scale data is because we really want to avoid punitive targeting of particular groups of people based on their ability or inability to social distance. And with these contact tracing apps and personal data, one of the critical things here is that it's not used in a way that exacerbates inequality and is punitive. So that's something that I think this whole field is going to have to really think hard about in any context. But particularly in the US, I think it's going to be an issue. And then we should be thinking creatively about how to re-employ a lot of the newly unemployed populations to help us fight this thing. Right? Let's try and put people to work to distribute different kinds of PPE or help with contact tracing protocols, while making sure that we're not putting them at excess risk, but there should be creative ways that we can, manage this threat and simultaneously, think about the economic hardship that the impoverished communities here are going to have to suffer through. MichaelRight now, what do you find, for you personally, are the most interesting or the most salient points that you're tracking as you develop your unfolding thing? We'll tie a bow on it with this question. What do you think are the channels or the types of data that are most relevant to a randomly selected audience member right now? CarolineYeah. So I think that there are two things. The first thing is there is a race right now to develop serological tests, and that's going to be absolutely critical. So that's a test that looks for antibodies to this virus. It's a marker of infection. Once we have serological tests, we're going to need to roll them out to make sure that we are sending healthy people who have some level of immunity and we still don't know whether people are immune, but hopefully they are. So first of all, the serological tests are going to be critical, and that will help us estimate how many people never had symptoms, the epidemic size, parameterize a lot of the models, think through policy scenarios, as well as get people back to work and back to their normal lives as quickly as possible. The second thing I think we really need to do is to monitor and measure what social distancing interventions are doing, whether they're working, how much reduction in mobility is needed to reduce transmission by a certain amount.That's going to be critical as we move towards a situation where we're going to relax some social distancing interventions and not others. Right? Is it okay to open schools? Is it okay to open workplaces? We're going to need to make those decisions in an evidence-based way. So again, linking some of this mobility data to actual COVID is going to be critical. For that we need testing. So like everyone, I would call for more testing, randomized testing, good study design and then moving forward. I think that for me this is a probably once in a lifetime—I hope once in a lifetime—event. So my hopes and fears are that I hope that it leads to a radically restructured society and a much more inclusive society that recognizes how interconnected we are globally and within our communities. And I think a positive outcome from all of this could be that we start to be much more community-minded and we start to think through how we provide healthcare to people in a way that reflects their needs.And so the good outcome could be that we are more equitable on the other side of this, and we've restructured supply chains so our dependencies are more local and so on, while not giving up the really vital international aid and cooperation that we need for our global world. My fear is that that won't happen. And like with other pandemics that have come and gone, we will come through this, we'll scrape through, it will be a disaster for many people but we’ll scrape through and we will have learned nothing. So that's my biggest fear is that we'll end up on the other side of this with a weakened society that has suffered a lot, both economically and socially, and that we will not have taken the opportunity to restructure our society in ways that will benefit everyone. So, I don't know. I think people need to really think through what their values are  and how we move forward to make political decisions that reflect those values. That's my hope. MichaelWell, I think with a trumpet blast, we can call that the end of this conversation. Caroline, thank you so much for taking the time. CarolineThanks for having me. Nice to talk to you.
28,Episode Details / Transcript MichaelSo we're back for week three and I feel like the first two episodes in this miniseries have really set us up to dig into this latest set of articles and find some jewels of insight in there. DavidYeah. This one is pretty much firmly in the complexity territories now. MichaelSo the first piece we have, which links back to your discussion of the viral action of the novel coronavirus in our first episode, is by Santiago Elena. Why don't you open this one up for us? DavidYeah. So this certainty touches all sorts of really intriguing ideas here. So for those who don't know, scientists basically does fundamental science using the virus as a model system. So if somebody is not primarily interested in the virus as an agent for disease, but he thinks about the virus the way, say a physicist who is working in quantum mechanics would think about the hydrogen atom or a biologist would think about the worm C. elegans, in relation to development.So it's a model system and in that respect is rather late. Darwin's finches. And I want you to mention that. So folks may remember that in 1835, Darwin gets to the Galapagos archipelago, he makes these observations on the finches, which subsequently, once back in London, he realizes working with a number of others, that the bill morphology of each of these finches varies according to the habitats in which they live, the islands and in which they live, most notably the food that they eat, leaves, seeds, vampiric, insects, and so forth.And this became known as the Darwin Finch story, and it's a story of adaptive radiation and viruses are just like that. But instead of feeding on different plants and animals, they feed on different cells. So we talked about the coronavirus feeding on the cells in the pathway regulating cardiovascular function.But you have viruses like parvo viruses that feed and heart cells and herpes viruses that replicate in epithelial cells or hepatitis viruses and liver cells. So in that respect, they look a lot like large charismatic birds and mammals. But then there's one very crucial difference and that is that unlike large, multicellular creatures where we describe them as being members of a species, a virus is really a member of what Eigen and Schuster called a “quasi-species.” So instead of thinking of a point in space which would be a species, a type, they occupy a cloud because they're so mutable that what we think of as the lineage is a much more amorphous population of variants rather than a single category of biological variety. Should I just continue or do you want to interject on that? MichaelHe makes a distinction that I think is important here with RNA viruses and the mutation rates that I think brings us to a key point I know you wanted to discuss. DavidYes. So now we have this rather interesting difference between a regular species and a viral quasi-species. And the great thinker in this field was one of the early frequent visitors to the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winner, Manfred Eigen. And he had been Werner Heisenberg's student as in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that if you know more about position, then you know much less about its conjugate variable, momentum. And this is very famous and Eigen was very inspired that way of thinking and look for something like it in living systems. And what he discovered  was the error threshold that if a living lineage has a very high mutation rate, there is a possibility that it can cross a threshold and vaporize itself. So think about water being heated up and becoming water vapor. If you take a virus and you start increasing its mutation rate, that cloud I described grows and at a critical point called the error threshold, that cloud diffuses into free space and the virus disappears. And in a paper in 2002 Manfred Eigen suggested that one way that we could eliminate a virus infection is by doing something completely counterintuitive. Instead of creating a vaccine, say that prevented its infection, we're actually going to increase its mutation rate. And you'd think that would make it more adaptable. But at that critical point of the error threshold, the virus will just vaporize, it'll do what water does when you heat the temperature up above the boiling point. And this is something that Santiago has been very interested in, and in this article, he suggests a form of viral treatment based on what are called defective interfering particles or DIPs. So when every virus infects a cell or when every quasi-species infects a cell, it generates a ton of defective viruses because even though a coronavirus, as we said, has a relatively low mutation rate, it still generates a lot of error. And so any given cell produces viruses that are viable, that could infect future cells, and viruses that are non-viable and he wants to sort of use those non-viable viruses as decoys and stick them in cells, in order that most of the viruses appropriate defective parts. So this insight of Manfred Eigen’s, that you could push a virus over the threshold, can form the basis of a treatment in terms of these defective interfering particles. MichaelThis issue of the error threshold ties in a lot from last week's conversation to pretty much everything that we're discussing today. I feel like I'll be calling back to Miguel Fuentes’ piece on the way that they were able to detect changes in the structure of social networks through Twitter data on an impending crisis before the crisis even happens. What I see there is something like this, like you know as society itself approaches this error threshold in communication—and I might be jumping ahead here but I think you know, calling the shot before we make it might be helpful—there seems like in a discussion of the opportunity of crisis, a deep relationship between the opportunity and the crisis, because there is something about this escalation of novelty, whether it's genetic or memetic, is involved in these catastrophes. It’s key to understanding why they even occur. DavidYeah, I think there is definitely running through today's conversation this idea of error and opportunity, collapse and rebirth, and whether it's a virus or the fossil record or the behavior of financial markets and it is extremely interesting to try and understand the nature of that nexus. The Santiago paper gives one beautiful example. Viruses need to mutate to evolve in order to infect new cells and to evade the host immune system. But there is a critical value of mutation where they obliterate themselves and so it has exactly that character you're describing. And the question is, “Can we come to understand that and intervene?” And the last thing we'd want to do, and it's one of the reasons by the way, that people never used Eigen’s original proposal for viral therapy, because it looked as if we didn't know where that threshold was and we would be inadvertently making it more evolvable as opposed to pushing it if you like to collapse.The other one I do want to mention though, since we are on the Santiago contribution is, we talked about this also before, which is in a fundamental science versus applied science. These fundamental ideas, which seem really quite esoteric—you know, go back to Heisenberg and uncertainty and mutability and selection—that actually become the basis of therapy. But it's also in practice because Santiago's lab very quickly moved all of its polymerase chain reaction machines from their lab into biohazard secure rooms. And so the machinery of basic science could be mutated into application also. And I think that's really intriguing that these events are not only opportunities to rethink basic science, but to rethink the way that science is conducted. MichaelYeah, which brings us real cleanly into Doug Erwin's piece about not letting a crisis go to waste. He says in there that, “In past mass extinctions, the factors favoring survival have had little to do with those that provide an advantage during ‘normal times’.” When you think about evolution making use of what is lying around, it seems like the opportunities here are in this lovely Stephen Jay Gould word, the exaptation, the appropriation of existing parts into new uses. So let's talk about Doug's paleontological big picture view on this. DavidYeah. So paleontologists as you well know maker or a sort of a different species, they, they think about things on much longer timescales. So while we're worrying about hundreds, thousands of years, they're worrying about millions if not billions of years. So it's a very different mindset. And Doug, interestingly in a foreshadowing of what Bill Miller will talk about is talking about mass extinctions and just as paleontologists who recognize very coarsely five major mass extinctions, Bill mentions in his own lifetime, five major stock market crashes. So that was rather interesting. Most of us are familiar with the extinction of the dinosaurs, but Doug focuses on the End-Permian extinction event, the so-called Permian-Triassic extinction event about 250 million years ago, which was much, much larger with about 90% of marine species and about 70% of land species going extinct. So it was truly catastrophic event in Earth history.But Doug makes this point that it's not the extinction itself that interests him, but what happened afterwards. And as he points out, what happened afterwards were dinosaurs and insects and mammals and turtles and perhaps even the first flowering plants. So there was something about that cataclysmic event that sort of in some sense cleared the board and allowed for the possibility, entirely new forms of life to emerge. And the question is, what are those characteristics that lead a clade or group to go extinct? What are those characteristics that allow it to survive it? And then what are the characteristics which allow new species in groups to come into existence after the extinction event. Most people are familiar with trilobites, these little arthropods that you find in the fossil record that survive an awfully long time from over 500 million years ago up until this event and then they were disappeared completely—as opposed to things like bryozoans, which are little invertebrates look like corals that survived and prospered. And in all those new forms that we mentioned before that came into existence. And I think what Doug is suggesting is borrowing an insight from the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, that mass extinction events are periods of sort of creative destruction and the aftermath of creative destruction is typically innovation. And the reason for that is by and large, because all of the competitive trophic networks that had constrained the growth of lineages are now lifted, allowing for the possibility of entirely new forms to emerge and dominate. MichaelYeah, I’m specially fond, in a much smaller framing, of thinking about this in an ecological sense about a mature forest canopy and a tree falling and then suddenly new light reaching the forest floor. There's one way of looking at this, that it's about available resources. Like you just said, there's less competition and in some sense more to go around. Now, I mean obviously this is a kind of a morbid paleontological angle on what, what is more to go around mean? It means everything that has just died. DavidYou're absolutely right. It's, it's very strange that way because most people will be familiar with this from companies, you know, that in some sense go extinct, you know, like Research In Motion with their Blackberry phone. That in some sense allowed or established the foundations for the selective context that became the adoption of the iPhone. So it's very much a part of economic life and it's certainly a part of the life of ideas, but it's difficult to reconcile with the timescales that we live in. And that's what makes the paleontological view particularly interesting, because it points out that if you integrate over long enough periods of time, you realize that these events are crucial to the kind of Earth we've become familiar with. MichaelDoug leaves us with this question at the end of this piece, which is, why did these particular organisms, the atheists, is the turtles, the dinosaurs, why did they succeed in the wake of the Permian extinction? And you know, I think starting to answer that question carries us into Manfred Laublichler’s piece on the evolutionary fitness landscape, which is in a sense a sort of abstraction of the channels through which evolution can flow and and reach opportunity. Although I guess that's sort of an inversion of the rugged landscape as an image. DavidYeah. So yeah, Manfred is interested in stasis and change and evolution biologists following Gould and Eldredge and others slowly came to realize that non-change required as much explanation has change. And there are essentially two sources of constraint if you like, that Manfred introduces us to. One is external and that's what we think of as fitness or natural selection. And in the 1930s Sewell Wright introduced the idea of the fitness landscape. So think of a landscape with topographical features like peaks and valleys and think of a well-adapted species as living at the top of a peak and the valley is being maladaptive intermediates. What evolution does is over the course of time shift that landscape such that different species come to prosper at different points in time. And a mass extinction event is precisely that event that completely changes the topography of Wright's fitness landscape.So that would be an external constraint. But in the 1940s about a decade after Sewell Wright, Conrad Waddington introduced the idea of the epigenetic landscape, and that's not an external constraint. It's an internal one. And it says that development from egg to embryo to adult morphology follows a path which is very canalized or very restricted. You can't all of a sudden, for example, develop three extra limbs that grow out of your back. It's very, very improbable. And the reason for that is that the trajectory of the phenotype from egg to embryo to adult is very constrained. What he called canalized. And this has nothing to do with fitness per se because it operates on a much shorter timescale, but to do with the constraints not of trophic networks but of regulatory networks, gene regulatory networks, and they constrain the number of possible forms that can be realized. And Manfred's question I think in this article is, how do we consider the relationship between the internal epigenetic and external fitness landscapes at times of crisis? How does one influence the other? And I think it's more a question than an answer because we don't know why a change in the topography of the fitness landscape liberates regulatory networks to explore new body types. MichaelI was just reading last night, about research on the origins of multicellularity and some experimental work done with yeasts where they were able, over the course of a year—this was published in Science—ver the course of a year compel yeasts through predation to form multicellular, like what they called a “snowflake yeast.” This was two years ago. And one of the things that that snowflake, that very prototypical multicellular organism would do… When one of its cells, you know, the oldest cells at the edges of it, the organism as it grows from the center out had the highest rate of mutation. And so they started to see early specialization in cell types because the cells at the base of those stalks of the snowflake, would commit programmed cell death and release that mutated stock out to grow its own separate colony. I wonder whether at the intersection between those two different ideas about the fitness landscape, more or less internal developmental and external evolutionary, are basically the same thing but operating at different scales. And so that brings us back to the way that slow and fast variables are related in the last conversation. DavidYeah, it's not known. I mean there are some simple explanations. For example, if the environment is fixed that's called normalizing selection. And so rare mutations that don't align with the selection pressures tend to disappear quickly. They don't get a foothold. And it's not that they're not there, it's just that they're largely invisible. And so when the landscape changes, all of this so-called cryptic variation becomes visible. But there are more interesting mechanisms, along the lines of perhaps the yeast had you mentioned, associated with error repair proteins like chaperone proteins. So these are proteins that help other proteins fold because not all proteins fold into their right tertiary configurations that give them their function. And if you remove those chaperone proteins or down-regulate them, all sorts of protein folding patterns appear that weren't there before, because they're not all being folded into the same shape. And this allows for the possibility of new function. And there is some data to suggest that when the environment changes, these chaperone proteins are down-regulated in order to allow more protein variation to exist, which might turn out to be beneficial. So these are very new results that suggest that there are pathways connecting the external to the internal, but we don't fully understand how they work, presumably through some means of epigenetics—that is, changes to DNA or protein that's non heritable. MichaelSo this is linked to Andreas Wagner's work, right? On applying selection pressures in the laboratory, and watching the bacterial cultures flail about for a creative solution? DavidYeah. But with bacteria because they have also quickly, you can never be sure that the variation wasn't there to begin with, but just at very low frequencies. Whereas these epigenetic mechanisms are a direct causal line from some form of sensor in the world into the cell. And I should correct myself because of course with epigenetic modifications of the genome, they are heritable. Epigenetic modification of chromatin is not. But that's in some sense the experimental challenge. Are we seeing regular evolution where we don't have to invoke a new connection between the fitness and the epigenetic landscapes, or is it something different? And that's been very difficult to tease apart. MichaelSo there's a kind of a Hail Mary pass I want to throw to you to get us to Mirta Galesic and Henrik Olsson's piece, which is about affordances. What is possible in that epigenetic interrelating between the organism and its environment. And it seems like it starts to possibly answer the question that Doug leaves us with about who survives the mass extinction to flourish after…Which is something in Santiago Elena's piece about the distinction between generalist and specialist viruses. Specialist viruses are sort of, as you put it, more canalized. They are narrower in their specificity and therefore more subject to disruption and that's what you see in the record of extinctions is… When I was at the University of Kansas, our head of paleontology said if you want to survive a mass extinction live on insects, be as much of a generalist as you can, soak up what resources are available rather than subsisting on a very specific resource. So with Mirta and Henrik's piece, this kind of thinking, you look at our communication modalities and cross cultural communication and this issue of scientists communicating with new audiences that if we only speak business to business or scientist to scientist, then we are less resilient in the face of disruption to our social networks. DavidYes, no, I think there are, I think there are definitely connections. One of which is what does a crisis like the one that we're facing do to science communication, what role does it play? How willing are people to accept facts as opposed to resist them? And the other one has to do with the internal and external constraints on credibility. So let me just mention them both. So the first point that I think connects back is this observation that Mirta and her colleagues have been making, which is that people are not only influenced by reputable centralized sources of discovery but by their neighbors, by their friends, by their family and community. And in fact in many cases when forced to make a decision between a fact as presented, you buy a reputable newspaper for example, versus your neighbors, you’ll choose the opinion of your neighbor.And the reasons are obvious: the consequences of disagreeing with the newspaper are nearly zero, whereas the consequences of disagreeing with your friends and family can be rather catastrophic. And that is very close to the external constraints of the fitness landscape versus the internal constraints of the epigenetic landscape. And scientists would be well advised to understand that. And I think we've all been seeing this in other catastrophic areas like climate change. Just presenting people with the facts and hoping that there will be in some sense absorbed and acted on is never enough, because there are other forces at play that constrain people's abilities to accept them. And the big connection to this particular episode is what happens in crisis, because in crisis, those internal epigenetic constraints are relaxed and all of a sudden more people are trusting the authority of scientists, as they point out in their article.Medical practitioners now are considered reputable sources of information for very good reasons. And so the bigger push is, “Look, if this is true, now is the time not to become despondent about our inability to deal with the challenge, but actually to present the facts as best as we know them and ask everyone to collaborate in a rational empirical debate about how to move forward.  And to extend it beyond the coronavirus to other issues like climate, which for related reasons people have been resistant to accept.” And so again, this is that “crisis in opportunity.” What happens post cataclysm? And I think they're being rather optimistic, which is nice. And considering the possibility that we'll have a different attitude towards reason. MichaelThere was something in Mirta and Henrik's piece about abstraction and how the shift in the costs of disagreeing with your community versus disagreeing with scientific authority are about how the phenomenon becomes evident to people. Like you were saying, it's a shifting in the external fitness landscape. But you had another point you said there were two pieces. DavidYeah. So I guess one piece was this question of who is a reliable source of information, and why do local forces dominate global forces? In other words, the beliefs of your neighbor, family and friends over the beliefs of a community of putative experts. And the second point was why during a crisis, the balance of forces area shifted such that the external source of information could come to dominate. And I think that's what we've seen now. And I think you make the point, Michael, exactly that the reason why that could happen is because what felt like a very remote consideration was domesticated, because our friends and family are suffering from this disease. And so we can see it at the local level. It's become an “epigenetic” phenomenon, in that metaphorical sense and now that opens up the opportunity for us to think in a much more rational, empirical way about how best to proceed. MichaelI'm curious how you see this linking to Bill Miller's piece because Mirta Galesic and Henrik Olsson are talking about a conversation that we're observing fold over itself. In an important way it's distinct—again, the Miguel Fuentes piece, part of what we're seeing is the information explosion—and I'm curious, this is the trust in scientific authority seems to be a kind of innovation at the edge of chaos like we were talking about with Santiago Elena and viral evolution. There's this threshold of social coherence. How do you see that linked to Bill’s? DavidSo I think if you look at this catastrophe, it has many different elements, and for most of us it's dominated by two factors: concerns about our health and concerns about our economic prosperity. So somehow the world of a virus, the microscopic world has become aligned with the macroscopic market, and very few people have any understanding of how that connection works. And of course the history of our scholarship is a history of silos and departments and disciplines. So it's so rare to see an economist talking with an epidemiologist and I think it's again one of those creative destructions that we've seen with the coronavirus, that that is now happening. It's something of course that we've been doing at SFI for a long time and I'm extremely gratified to see it. Now his contribution from Bill is about that the market and trying to understand what's going on now.I should just say a few words about Bill. Of course, he was the former chairman of our board. Someone we know very well, I've often thought of Bill is the Alex Honnold, the free solo climber of investment, in the sense that he can rise, you know, faster and further than anyone else, but he can also take very dramatic plunges. And so he has a very unique attitude towards risk. And he's pointed out many times that the market is a machine. It's a machine for pricing goods and services. And in order for the machine to work, it has to have the right inputs. And those are the costs of manufacture and the values that we assign to these goods and services. But when faced with uncertainty, the market does something very strange. It always assumes the worst and that produces very rapid downturns. But it also means that as soon as that input, which is that information at once becomes available, you can get very rapid upturns.And that in part explains why the market is so volatile. Now Bill makes the point that in the course of his own career, he's seen five (including this one) major stock market crashes, which he in the Schumpeterian paleontological mode refers to as opportunities. The first in ’73, ’74 during war in the Middle East, during the Vietnam war, another in 1982, and other 1987 a fourth in 2008-2009, which for many of us experienced, and now of course the most recent. And the first is an insight into Bill as a very special kind of species. He was at the time a lieutenant in the army in Munich, in Germany, and when the market was at its worst, he went into a local Merrill Lynch office. This was long before he was in any sense involved with investment and bought shares near the market bottom and he was doing exactly what his hero, John Maynard Keynes suggested, which is that “every serious investor has to learn how to suffer grievous losses with great equanimity.”His view was when the market is at its worst is when the investor should get up and become involved and he makes this point that just isn't the fossil record. There are new species that emerge after a mass extinction event. It is also true that in markets subsequent to a stock market crash, you see extraordinary innovation in the production of goods and services. So he introduces us to this notion of “high beta.” I have to ask everyone to sort of visualize the following graph. If you were to plot over some appropriate unit of time on the Y axis, the returns in some stock and on the X axis, the returns to the market in general, if they were perfectly correlated and you fitted a regression line through that data, the slope of that line would be one and your stock would behave, just let the market.But if your stock is more volatile than the market, then that beta is greater than one. So a small change in the market corresponds to a very big change in your particular stocks. And Bill describes himself as a high beta investor, which means that he will pick typically cyclical stock, which has certain characteristics, which make them rather volatile in times of uncertainty, but with the possibility that they'll do extraordinarily well. He’s one of these people that has the ability to in some sense consider the long timescale. Now not all of us can do that. I mean I'm not in that position. But if you do and you can see through to the end of the cataclysm, typically you're positioned to do extraordinarily well.And this is an insight that John Templeton made when he said you always buy at the point of maximum pessimism, which feels counter to our instinct, but is the adaptive thing in the cultural setting to do. So I think Bill is presenting us with a kind of an insight into the mind of a free solo investor who has done extraordinarily well by understanding fast and slow timescales and the behavior of markets and how things that might do badly during a crisis might do extraordinarily well after it. And so in some sense we want to develop this long temporal vision to sustain these periods of uncertainty. And consider what we imagined might do well in an entirely new context. MichaelSo to elaborate that extinction and evolution metaphor into Bill's piece, there’s a couple things here. One is he talks about, he says, “Going into 2020, I thought economic risk was low and that if the market was going to decline, it would be either because of geopolitical events or some exogenous shock,” and that “we got the exogenous event in the form of a global pandemic.” So, exogenous. This gets us back to this question of the internal and external fitness landscapes. It is an attack from within the body, but it's an attack from beyond the models that we had…or at least a lot of people had. DavidThat’s right, Michael. I think people have pointed this out that there are significant differences between perturbations that reveal true endogenous structural deficiencies in markets—like for example, subprime mortgages—versus exogenous perturbations. And there is this rather interesting empirical data set that suggests that perturbations that are endogenous tend to persist longer than perturbations that are exogenous. So that would be analogous to a mass extinction event that was primarily driven by some change in the environment versus some deficiency in the genetic architecture of life itself. That meant that it was extremely difficult to now adapt back to the new conditions of existence. MichaelYeah, so this sort of B point with Bill's piece is, when I hear him say, for example, “The commonly offered advice in a steep market decline such as we are experiencing to buy quality names on sale is a great prescription for under-performance in a recovery.” What I hear there is, don't over-fit your model. This is again, possibly a prescription for generalist strategies, evolutionarily. You don't want to over specialize in one sector. You want to hedge the bets and that's a bad strategy when things are normal, like Doug was saying: if you try to fill every niche in a relatively mature, robust ecosystem, you're going to be out competed by specialists that are able to do it more efficiently. But if you're a raccoon or a cockroach, if you're willing to sort of throw darts all over the board, then that strategy which kept the mammals under the feet of dinosaurs for 150 million years ended up being what brought them to prominence after the dinosaurs went out. DavidYeah, and that is in some sense, what you've described is the microbial mode of living, the quasi-species that we started with, which is the better description of microbial species than the concept of a species—that is the cloud versus the point or the particle. It’s exactly this high mutation, high risk, high return strategy. And viruses do very well in a crisis. And I think what we're hearing from everyone in this particular episode—whether it's science communication, the way that we mobilize laboratories, what we learned from the history of life is that you sort of have to adapt in that way and explore the possibility of variant ideas at a much higher temperature, than you would during periods of stability. And I think that's an important message. It's extremely difficult to do, but it is an opportunity for a society to be more experimental than it otherwise would be. MichaelTo double down on Mirta and Henrik's optimism, I'm pleased to see that this seems to be the way that society is responding to this. Everyone I see is talking about the creative opportunity that this provides. And I know that you and I have stressed, it's important not to be Pollyannaish about this. It's important to understand longterm optimism is not in competition with short term pessimism, but at least people are generally displaying a sort of native intuitive understanding that now is the time to try something fresh. DavidYeah, and I think that where we started the whole series—with inner citizen based medicine and citizen based science… If science is anything, it's the rigorous pursuit of new ideas, and the idea that the world now is entertaining a variety of new ideas is extraordinarily refreshing and necessary in order to be, as you say, a longterm optimist. MichaelSo what fresh ideas will we be discussing next week? DavidNext week here are some of the topics we'll be discussing. One will be related to today in terms of centralization and decentralization, taking a perspective on the evolution of society through the lens of the Constitution. Another will be issues of surveillance and technology. As we see tech companies stepping up and assisting society and tracking test results, we’re also very aware that these companies have not always shown the greatest, moral probity when it comes to the use of that information in the long term. Issues about education: this is not just a communication opportunity for science, but an educational one because now we have to take these insights that we've learned about all these systems being connected and perhaps reconsider what we think of as the disciplines and the curriculum. We'll be talking about the statistics of false positive and false negative rates and how we can develop an intuition for what those mean for each of us in our lives. MichaelExcellent. Just a reminder to everyone listening, if you haven't already signed up, the InterPlanetary Festival team has been putting out these wonderful little workbooks on each of these weeks of material, summarizing the essays, putting them together in quiz form, making them something that you can work through with your families or whoever you happen to be cooped up with the interplanetaryfest.org. Every Wednesday they send out a new one of these workbooks. DavidGreat. MichaelThank you, David. DavidThank you, Michael. Thank you, everybody.
29,Episode Details / Transcript MichaelWell, David, we are in the mix for week four of the Transmission series and this week's is kind of a grab bag. But with the diversity of entries for this one, I think we're starting to see something that taps into themes from all three of the last week's episodes. I'm looking forward to exploring this with you. Where should we begin? DavidWell, yeah, I think there is a thread in this labyrinth having to do with or authority and power and it's best use and control. And I think the logical place to begin as we have in the past is at the micro and work to the macro. And I think David Wolpert’s article on Bayesian statistics is where I think we should start. MichaelYeah, David actually does a really good job with this piece in introducing the outline of Bayes’ theorem. Not assuming the prior of who in our audience knows what this is, why don't you lay this out for us? DavidYes. So David starts by making the point that our best decisions are based on when appropriate data and typically estimates of datasets which are incomplete. And we've talked a lot in this series about R0, the reproductive rate during an epidemic. And these are things that we have to estimate from very noisy data. And the point that David makes, which we all know of course, is that our prognostications and projections and predictions are only as good as those estimates. And those are changing of course dynamically. And so we're constantly having to go back to the data to make better estimates. And he introduces us to what is really a very foundational idea. It’s about 200 years old, and it was derived by an English minister, Thomas Bayes. And it's the appropriate way to think about conditional probabilities.So most of us growing up learned about probabilities in terms of fractions. And so if 50 out of 100 people are female, then the probability of being female in a population is a half. And that's how most of us think about probabilities or odds. But there is a more complicated idea, which is not a straight probability, but what's called a conditional probability. So for example, what was the probability of being British if your favorite food is a scotch egg? Well I think it would probably be quite high, right? Because no one in their right mind who wasn't would ever go near the thing. And this is not a simple fraction. To calculate a conditional probability—what is the probability of A given B, you need to use an equation and that equation is known as Bayes’ Rule. And why does that matter? And David gives a very nice example: because if you use fractional intuition for probabilities, you make terrible mistakes.He gives the example of a test. Let's say it's a test to determine whether or not you are positive you possess the COVID-19 virus. Let's say that it's been established that that test is 90% accurate in its control group. So we have a conditional probability here. What is the probability that you have the disease if you test positive? Now, most people, thinking “fractionally” if you like, would say, “Well look, you've told me that the test is 90% accurate. If I'm positive, there's a probability of a 0.9 or 90% chance that I have the disease.” And that would be absolutely wrong because Bayes’ Rule, the equation says it's not enough to know the success of the test. You have to know the incidence of the disease in the population, what is sometimes called the prior. And David says, let's imagine that we know that only about 1% of the population is infected.So now we have this test we've established in our control group is 90% accurate. You plug it into the equation and it tells you what are the odds of being sick if you test positive. And it's about 0.1, or 10% chance. So not 90% but 10%, and that is because the equation says that the incidence in the population gives you a sense of the true population-wide false positive rate. So it's really important because people are going to be taking tests. Those tests will be accurate. But if that prior, if that background statistic is inaccurate—in other words, how many people are truly infected in the population—then that reliability of the of the test could really titrate between almost zero and 100% and so that is a really important first point makes.Now the second point if you like conundrum is how do you arrive at an accurate measure of what that prior is? I mean, what is the rate of infection in the population at large? Well, to know that you have to use Bayes’ Theorem, again, you have to test, but we've already established that to test you have to have a prior. And this gives rise to this whole field of what's called Bayesian updating or Bayesian particle filters, which is that you have to do it over and over again. So you plug in a prior, which is approximate, you get what's called the posterior, and then you plug that back in as the prior and you do this over and over again and you hope you converge on the accurate statistics. And so the big philosophical insight here is that your estimates of your chances of being infected up are only as good as this data that you don't really possess. And so even if the mathematics is absolutely watertight and correct, garbage in, garbage out, and it's extremely difficult to make those estimates. MichaelWe’re seeing this in practice now with the Stanford study that dramatically recalculated the death rate that just came out this week. I feel like this links in kind of two distinct ways with Mirta Galesic and Henrik Olsson’s piece and their work on social science and how all of us suffer local bias based on trying to infer global truths from the local sampling of our intimate social networks. Right? Because that's exactly what we're doing: we're assuming a sort of a marginal probability rather than a conditional probability. The condition being that we're only sampling like the five people that all want to see the same movie, or so on. So that's a piece of it, which is having a little bit of forgiveness for the true and terrible complexity of making an accurate estimate on this issue. DavidI think, again, I mean your mathematical formulae You can be absolutely right. In other words, the logic can be correct, but if you feed that formula with the wrong data, it will spit out the wrong answer. Of course, it's obvious, but it's not always obvious in debate because people will say, “your theory is wrong” or “the formula is wrong.” No, it's not. What is wrong is that we don't have the empirical grounds with which to conclude and, and I think that's something that's worth bearing in mind. MichaelIt's sort of a like a point that Caroline Buckee brought up in a recent episode when she was talking about the difference between weather forecasting and epidemiological modeling. where she said, if you predict that it's going to rain tomorrow and everyone goes out with an umbrella, it doesn't change the fact that it's going to rain. But if you say there's going to be a pandemic and everyone isolates and then there isn't a pandemic, people have a habit of blaming the model or blaming the scientist. And so I think that this is, this is a sort of a tricky condition. This is the other point with Mirta and Henrik's piece, is that the opportunity to reestablish trust in science and scientific communication right now is sort of contingent on people understanding this. I saw a kind of a tragic, a cartoon that was talking about, “Well, if we manage to do this well, if we managed to contain this and stave off the worst, if we have flattened the curve, then people are going to complain that the economic precautions that we have instituted weren't necessary. And so we face the possibility of a backlash against the people that were providing the very models that were used to protect us. DavidYou know, I mean that's always been the problem with successful medicine, that it's a victim of its own success. If a vaccination policy is very successful, then you see very few infected and that leads some people to claim that there's no longer any risk. And that's almost an insurmountable problem in the limits of human judgment. And the best you can do is show people in some sense in simulation what the world would be like minus the vaccine. But that’s a hard lesson to learn. MichaelSo there's another quantitative piece, Sid Redner’s piece. He's looking at this in a completely different way. I took this to be sort of more like back of the envelope math that, you know, when we're talking about in the first episode, the importance of not using models that are more complex than the data that we have. You know, this is a really good instance where you can kind of ballpark an estimate of the economic impact of COVID-19. He looks at Italy specifically. Why don't you walk us through this? DavidYeah, this is very nice. It’s very simple arithmetic, starting with this quote from Keynes from 1938 where Keynes makes the point that, “What is a model doing?” What a model is trying to do is segregate what you know, what do you call semi-permanent, from what you don't. And it's a very important point about the philosophy of models. In the first episodes we talked about overfitting noise as you just pointed out and the virtues of simplicity in the face of uncertainty. This is another point, which is that a good model minimizes novelty and restricts it to the hypothesis at hand. Meaning if I write down a mathematical model for an epidemic, you don't want to check my math, you don't want to determine where the calculus is, right or wrong. You want to determine whether my premise is right or wrong.So in any effort to theorize, you're always trying to take a framework where almost everything is known and can be verified in order to reduce the ambiguity around that one insight you're making, which is hard to verify. And so this is a very important philosophical point about model building and not everyone gets it. And so a lot of people try and do everything that's new. And of course in the end, you're not sure what you're really evaluating: the mathematics, the logic or the hypothesis. So what Sid does is he says, “I'm gonna get the simplest thing in the world arithmetic, right? So there's no question yet. And I'm going to take data, which we sort of know to be true.” And he says, “So here's the deal. We'll say, what do we know about Italy prior to COVID, when we know that life expectancy was on the order of years?”And we know that in a population of about 60 million people, just over 2000 people die from a variety of causes. So that's the Keynesian background, right? That's the thing we know. So if you look at covert late March, we can say right away that it's responsible for a 35% increase per day. So this gets to that rate remark we were making in relation to the Melanie and analogies piece. So that's very significant. So now you can try and say what's the cost of that and what do we know? Well we know how much it costs to be in an ICU unit, but we don't know the Italian ICU data. We know the American data. So in the U S about 17% of daily fatalities end up in ICUs. And so if we go back to the Italian population, given the numbers we have in hand, we get about 350 expected ICU per day.But what do we see under COVID? About 800 per day. So that's 2.5 times baseline. So now we can ask, okay, what's the cost of ICU? It's about 1.6 thousand per day. Well, under those assumptions, we get about 1% of Italy's GDP being accounted for by the medical costs associated with treating COVID-infected individuals. 1% of GDP. And he makes the comparison to something like the National Science Foundation where he says, you know, if you were to think about that in American terms, that 1% of GDP per month, by the way, would pay for the total annual budget of the NSF twice every month. So these are very big numbers and it's simple linear arithmetic that he's using. And here's why I think it's important, and it's something he doesn't say explicitly, but I think it's a natural implication of his logic. If you look at the airline industry, the airline industry has lost on the order of tens of billions of dollars. And the same goes for say, the oil industry. The national economy is facing a loss of trillions of dollars. So these are very large numbers. How much would a virus surveillance operation have cost preemptively? Probably millions. So there's this interesting fact that industry, petrochemical, oil, airline, travel, service, if they had invested some sum of money in surveillance programs, they could have saved billions of dollars. And I think that’s the radical implication of these kinds of numbers: that some preemptive expenditure with these kinds of risks in mind could have saved national economies trillions of dollars. MichaelNow of course, you know, bending back to our last episode, on weathering a mass extinction, you know, this is exactly what we were talking about with bet hedging. That in times of relative stability, this kind of thing should be obvious but is not because the economic competition, you know, sort of a blind evolutionary process, doesn't tend to regard this as a valuable expenditure because it's not thinking ahead on the kind of timescale that's going to integrate these costs. DavidYes, that's absolutely true. But you will note, I mean we've been hearing in the media very divergent opinions on this. Most of us are very aware that in the last decade, and we've mentioned this before, we've had comparable viral outbreaks, whether it’s Ebola or SARS or MERS, and we were very fortunate that those viruses had lower transmissibility. If they had had higher transmissibility, it could have been worse than this situation. So in just a decade we've seen multiple instances which should lead us to understand that this is not a black swan event. And people who have been citing Bill Gates who pointed out as many had that something like this was inevitable. So in the same way that actuaries who are consulting with an insurance company calculate plausible risks, this is a totally plausible risk. What was I think unanticipated was the shutting down of aggregate demand. But now with this experience in hand, I think there's no excuse for industry and government not to take preventative measures and worry a little less about expenditures in the millions that might offset losses in the trillions. MichaelThis is a possible link between… When we were talking about natural selection and epigenetics and the two sort of internal and external fitness landscapes… This is the kind of thing that we see in fine-graining when we look at the epigenetic impact of like a famine on up to something like 14 generations of rat offspring; They find that environmental information is encoded so that they are remembering the condition of food scarcity. This is an instance where luckily, our society will probably be prepared for another pandemic for as long as the various memory systems that the various ways that our civilization encodes the trauma of an event like this will actually last. DavidYeah. I mean this is something that John Geanakoplos has been saying in relation to the rapidity with which the government responded with stimulus to COVID and a large part of that comes from the very recent memory of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. So most people in positions of authority experienced that event. So that was only a decade ago. If that event had been several decades ago, it might be that there would have been enormous disagreement as to whether or not stimulus was a good idea, which would have been of course disastrous. So I think you're absolutely right and we have to find mechanisms to allow for the persistence of memory. And that gets to exactly that point you were making earlier about vaccines, right? When a vaccine is too successful, people don't want to take them because they don't see the disease. We have to create in culture some means of maintaining an awareness of relatively infrequent events. MichaelSo this links us into Stephanie Forrest’s piece because you know, something that I've been seeing a lot of people talk about lately with respect to disease surveillance and the necessity of contact tracing and so on, is the concern that's still very, very much alive in most of us about the way that privacy and surveillance was handled after 9/11 and that, I think if nine 11 had not happened then we would probably as a whole in the United States be much more willing to indulge in what we obviously now consider sort of draconian surveillance measures, but we're aware of the way that these opportunities are very difficult to roll back. And, and so she's, she's looking at how do we balance the need for surveillance with the need for privacy. And she's got some interesting insights from cybersecurity and immunology. You want to talk about this? DavidYeah. So I think that's really interesting. But you know that that was novel. We didn't realize the extent to which that surveillance was possible. We now do and in consequence have been immunized, if you like, against that exploitation. And what Stephanie is talking about is issues related to anonymity and privacy when we still can make use of these technologies to good effect. The Stephanie, for those who don't know, has spent many, many years looking at parallels between biological evolution and immunology and technological evolution and looking at computer viruses in particular. One of the things that was discovered several decades ago about the immune system, which might surprise everyone is the following: how does the immune system mount a successful response to a pathogen it's never seen before? It does this by generating random variation in its antibodies, in its immune response, in its T cell receptors in particular, and this is enabled by a process called somatic hypermutation.Now if it generates random responses, what stops it from attacking itself? And that's called immunopathology and of course it does attack itself. So it's developed a method of negative selection or clonal deletion whereby any element of the immune system that attacks self is tagged and deleted, and what you're left with is the negative compliment of the self, which is everything that might infect you, right? In other words, you generate these random responses, you try and cover as much of the space as possible. You take out anything that attacks you. And in that space, what is left is hopefully an adaptive response to a novel infection. And why is that important? Well, it's important partly because you're anonymizing yourself. You're not signaling what you are because the self is not present in that set. Only the infection. And this turns out to be really important for dealing with computer viruses, because you don't know in advance what bit of code the computer virus is going to use or which part of your operating system it's going to attack.So exactly the same principle can be applied. You generate a whole random set of possible interventions and you eliminate any that attack your own code, leaving only the response which attacks the foreign code. And so this is a very interesting idea that in some sense anonymizes the self, removes the cell from the picture in order to remove non-self. So that really is useful for dealing with things like malware or spam. But what about this issue of contact tracing? That requires a very different idea, and this is based on this notion of cryptographic set intersections, and it works like this. Let's imagine you and me Michael, we get together in a brighter world where we can sit together at a bar or over a coffee, and we want to share our address books. We want to know who we have in common, if you like, which friends we have in common. We’re looking for what's called the intersection of the set. What we want to do is come up with a method whereby we don't share everything with each other. We only share the friends we have in common, so everything else is encrypted. The only thing that's not encrypted is the intersection, what we share.And that is exactly the idea that Stephanie is calling for in relation to contract tracing. I want to know all of the people with whom an infected person has come into contact. And that means I'm going to have to take a huge survey of the entire population, but I'm only interested in this intersection, the intersection of that person with the population, not everybody. And that’s critical because as Apple and Google and Facebook collect data, they're gonna have to collect it all to calculate the intersection. But what Stephanie is saying is, everything that isn't the intersection gets encrypted. So that can't be used in the future for reasons that we never approved of. MichaelI feel like we've moved into the domain where we're talking about the balance between a sort of central overview of the situation and a distributed overview. So this is a dovetail into the last two pieces from Carrie Cowan and Anthony Eagan on the way that our system that we've inherited as we move into this crisis has structured governance, and has structured education, as a way of addressing the conditions of a world that for all intents and purposes, in many ways, seems no longer to exist. DavidRight. So now we're moving back into this question of or authority versus citizen. And the first experience most of us have in our lives of both authority and very strong anti-authoritarian feelings is education. Right? Speaking for myself. You know, and Carrie points out that we're now experiencing one of the greatest large-scale experiments in education in the history of education. And that is in particular the experiment around digital distributed education and the use of digital classrooms and massively open online courses (or MOOCs)—because we have to, because we're isolated. And these are fairly new technologies at scale. The MOOC really started getting popular in the 2010s and it led to the whole notion of the flipped classroom—being this classroom where essentially you sort of do your prep in advance, you learn the facts and you use the social context to ask questions…as opposed to just listening to someone lecture, which you can do online anyway. And I think the first point Carrie makes is this moment in our history is accelerating the adoption of these platforms that we had already grown weary of in the last ten years, but now are being forced to adopt because we have no choice. And she makes this nice analogy to the flu of 1918 where that was a kind of pivotal moment, not only in society, in demographics but in education. Prior to 1918 only about 10% of the population had graduated high school, but by the 1920s it was more than double that. And that education was then the aspiration that many people in society had.She makes another point which I think is important, which is that the economic burden of education is incredibly high. From 2008 to 2018, tuition increased by about just under 40% and the net cost of engaging in education by over 20%. These are huge economic burdens and they're greater than the burden that many of us face from housing, for example. But there's also another burden, which is not economic but intellectual, which is the education has become so specialized and narrow. And I think if this circumstance of this pandemic is telling us anything, it’s that we now have to understand the entanglements in these complex systems and the educational system simply has to catch up with the reality of our circumstances. We need to emphasize connections, commonalities, what Carrie calls the mutualisms across the disciplines. Because if we don't, we're not going to really understand how to deal with the current circumstance.So now, here's something really interesting that she says: when in mid-March we all realized that our lives had been upturned and that we were going to be living these more solitary existences, there was a huge increase in the demand for MOOC platforms like Coursera and edX. That is, online educational resources. But their increased popularity paled in comparison to another trend. And that was the popularity of the game Minecraft. So the game Minecraft, which is an online construction game, is extraordinarily popular. I mean it's the highest selling video game of all time. About 100 million people play it each month. And the point that she makes is that Minecraft is this deeply experiential, curiosity-driven, super versatile environment to apply your mind to a whole multitude of projects that you and others have invented. So it's in some sense the ideal classroom.This is a world that I've been very involved in for quite a while. And my colleagues in Madison when I was there, Kurt Squire and Constance Steinkuhler, investigated this world at length.  What do people learn when they play World of Warcraft that they don't learn in a classroom. How are they different? How can we transfer the insights from those games to the workplace? And as you know, at the Interplanetary Festival we've been talking to people like Tarn Adams who wrote Dwarf Fortress, and Jonathan Blow who wrote The Witness, about precisely those kinds of ideas. I very much agree with Carrie's question, which is, “If there are these very powerful community based, very free, playful environments in which people can apply their minds, how can they help us rethink education in particular in this distributed sense?” So instead of recreating a classroom, which is what a MOOC basically does, what if you were to completely rethink it. And I agree that there's a huge amount to be learned from the developers of those games. MichaelYeah. So to link this back again to content that we've discussed in earlier episodes, this is very much linked to the discussion that we had about the way that a virus mutates so rapidly that it sort of occupies a cloud rather than a point. That we're seeing society move it into what you called last week, “a microbial mode,” where the educational process, the curricula, and the areas of specialization, are much more bespoke and individually tailored to the local. She mentions that the educational system that we have by and large now emerged out of this early 20th century industry context, which was very standardized. It was in many ways sort of like the adaptation of modern times zones in order to coordinate train travel. We were looking at trying to make something consistent universally. But that in the last several decades, the surface area of society and of the information that's relevant has grown so much… You know Adam Curtis's documentary, The Century of the Self, where he talks about lifestyle marketing and companies like Nike making it so you can design your own shoes on their website rather than just getting whatever they happen to sell you in the store.This is about also an adaptation to the small and fast…to link this to Miguel Fuentes talking about where we see the signal of an impending social crisis in the breakdown of a consensus narrative and polarization, but it's not just polarization. It seems like people are starting to split up and looking for local solutions to the problem as it emerges locally and regionally. DavidI understand where you're going. I feel as if when I look at something like Minecraft and insights from gaming for education, I have a sort of a list in some sense of what I think it's doing. One of them is freedom, which is moving away from the authoritarian top down approach to education where there are received ideas that have to be imparted at very high fidelity and that's sort of the drill, and that works for a very tiny fraction of people but not for the majority.And that takes us to the second point: diversity. We have a far better understanding now of the diversity of peoples, in particular cognitive diversity, than we did have let's say 20 years ago, and we know that not everyone learns the same way, and we have to provide mechanisms for, as you say, different timescales of learning and completely different ways of learning.The third is collaboration. When I went to school, collaboration was not even a little bit on the table of the classroom. It was outside when we played, but not inside. It was you at your desk listening to someone bore you to death. Things have gotten a lot better than when I went to school, but the idea that the classroom itself could be deeply collaborative, which is what happens in primary school, but much less than university, but it does happen, iis something that we could massively scale up.And the final one is is construction that you are being asked to contribute your world, your vision of the world for others to scrutinize and inhabit. That's exactly what you do with a theory. If I told you my theory, Michael, of thermodynamic evolution, you'd say, “That’s an interesting place to spend some time,” or not, and you would critique it and give me feedback.And Minecraft does all of this. It has freedom, it respects diversity, it enables collaboration, and it allows you to construct a world. And I think in a way that's what the best science is. We have been doing that historically, but I don't think the educational system for various reasons, many of them I think understandable, has really had the tools to introduce those principles in a very effective way. And I think the game environment is one way in which to think about that in a very principled way. MichaelYeah. So to call on earlier work that you've done, and the conversation we had last week regarding the error threshold, and the emergence of a syntax in response to this crisis… I love that she says, “Real world problems and the jobs that exist to solve them demand more than a knowledge of political science or physics or art history. They require a new style of thought that emphasizes connection and commonalities, mutualism across disciplines. The world is not getting simpler.” I take this as a sort of a hopeful note, that what we're seeing here is that infrastructures such as Minecraft is going to enable a kind of cognitive complex organism, like a multi-cellular educational process. DavidYeah. I want to add, I do feel very strongly that great classrooms, great research institutes and universities, have been doing this. In other words, these principles that we just discussed are not new. The problem has been that they've been restricted to a rather privileged few. They haven't been easy to scale up so that everyone can have access to that kind of free environment. And I think Minecraft in the domain of entertainment, very creative entertainment, has given us a keyhole to look through and see the possibility of a world where everyone, or many people, can have access to these principles. But there's a huge amount of work to be done. It's not as if we're just going to do science with Minecraft. Far from it. But we do need to learn from the joyousness and the freedom and the communitarian impulse that you see in those games to transform our educational system towards, as Carrie says, a more complex perspective. MichaelOkay. So this takes us real neatly into Anthony Eagan's piece because it seems that, you know what we're talking about here, the modularity of the educational process through universal standards, brings us to the balance of power that he's talking about with federalism, and the way that we need to both lean on—but also question the assumed priors—of the United States constitution and its and its articulation of this balance between bottom up and top down governance. DavidRight. So I think this piece touches on many of the previous pieces. In some sense the way I think about it, cause I've worked on constitutions, is the rule systems that in some sense run societies—I sometimes call it law OS, the legal operating system… We have been watching the tensions arising recently between the president and state governors in relation to opening up states to allow for economic economic activities to take place, and how we trade off minimizing the risks of infection and maximizing productivity. And this tension was the tension at the very founding of this country, of course, in relation to national sovereignty and the monarchy, in Europe and Britain in particular.Tony introduces this dichotomy that most people will be familiar with in this country, between on the one hand, the Federalists who advocated for a rather top down approach to robust governance, and the anti-federalists who advocated for a more distributed local state-based sovereignty. Many of the principles that found their way into the constitution in 1789 were articulated and explored in The Federalist Papers of 1788 that were written by Hamilton and Madison and Jay under their pseudonym Publius. And they really tried to explain what is this thing, how do you compromise between localized versus highly centralized needs? And Tony cites the 39th Letter, where it's written that the proposed government cannot be deemed a national one since its jurisdiction extends to only extends to certain enumerated objects only. So it has limited power and allows states to make certain residuary decisions of their own.The deep point here is that that's all very well under normal circumstances. But what happens in crisis? So there is a temporal dimension to the Constitution, and the rules that it encode in relation to individual liberties. Under crisis, people are willing to forgo freedoms—in order to benefit, for example, from centralized information—but in periods of peace and greater security, they want more autonomy. And there really isn't very good thinking about a dynamical Constitution that would execute different rule systems according to the circumstances of the society.I want to bring this to complexity science because there's a great deal that can be learned from the way that, for example, organisms are regulated. You could think if you like, of the genome as being a sort of constitution of a body, with the various cell types having greater or lesser freedoms in terms of pursuing their own metabolic or physiological functions. And in 2010 actually Mark Gerstein studied the structure of regulatory networks in five different species, bacteria, worms, flies, mammals, mice and so on. He found two very different modes of phenotypic governance, what he referred to as a more democratic structure, which is in some sense this sort of Anti-Federalist position where everything connected more or less to everything else very freely with very little evidence of hierarchy, and an autocratic structure where it was a much more sparse connection and much more top down.The most important observation that the Gerstein lab made was that the more complex a phenotype that is—the more parts it had, the more cell types, the larger it was—the more democratic it was in its regulatory governance.This is really important, and it gets to another point now, I'll try and wrap them up together. In 2017 I wrote a paper with Dan Rockmore and Tom Ginsburg and Chan Fang and Nick Foti on mathematical analysis of the history of constitutions. We looked at lots of different ideas, but we thought of the constitution as you like, of the rule system of a society, the playbook of of a society and how it changed through time. I want to make one point that relates to the Gerstein result and to Tony's insights, and that is that the U.S. Constitution is quite remarkable. In addition to being the first written constitution, it's also one of the most parsimonious. It's the simplest model. It's the back of the envelope physics model of how society should run. And that gives this country a huge amount of freedom in interpreting the Constitution. If you look at the Indian Constitution, it's huge. I mean, just to put this in perspective, the American Constitution is about 8,000 words long. The Indian is about 150,000 words long. The next longest is Nigeria, about 60,000 words long Monaco is the shortest. It's very intriguing that the shorter the constitution in some sense, the freer you are in the interpretation of its principles, and the longer it is, the more it specifies how you should act in any given context. So there's this nice complexity regulatory spin on this question of centralized and decentralized governance that's quite universal and it spans biological phenomena as well as cultural phenomena.I think we can learn a great deal from that. I would actually argue that there might even be a case to be made for a dynamical constitution whose essential size varies according to the challenges that a society faces. MichaelYeah. It sounds like at least in the case of the United States, that we have a good deal of epigenetic flexibility with our constitutional code. DavidYes. It’s sort of like saying it's the difference between, if you like in another metaphor, an abstract painting, say a Rothko, and a very realist, say Hudson River School, painting. One of them doesn't give you much space to interpret. It's beautiful, but you know precisely what it's about. You know that's a tree and that's a human figure and that's a deer and so on. But when you go to an abstract painting, you play a bigger role in the interpretation. If it's in some sense engaging with your brain in a more creative way. Not to say that realist art isn't creative.There's something very deep there. I think these more parsimonious models of reality, whether they're mathematical models, whether they're abstract or realist paintings, or whether they're legal documents, titrate between specificity and generality, constraint and freedom. And I don't think society has learned enough from the way that regulation works in the biological world. It wasn't known, of course, until very recently to apply to the legal world and to the sociopolitical world. MichaelTo think of this in terms of the society as a type of organism, that reminds me of what we were discussing last week in terms of evolvability and how the more narrowly specified trophic niches an organism occupies, the more difficulty it's going to have navigating a period of extraordinary turbulence like this one. That in some ways in the United States, our constitution affords us a sort of more of an insectivorous, or a raccoon approach. DavidI don't know. I think you opened it up, I think the right analogy was microbial. It's smaller and it's more of a generalist and that's why it's enduringly influential. MichaelSo to bring us back around the notion of authority and assumed priors, the question here really is, “At what timescale or is the problem that we're facing operating at?” In what ways is this a question for the aggregation of signals from throughout the social body and the intentional conscious decision to implement a coordinated central plan? And in what ways is it a matter of reflex? You know, you don't want to have to sit there and think about lifting your hand off a hot stove. Obviously this is a problem that demands some balance of both. And where is that balance? DavidYeah, I think it gets to our research on the nature of complex time, if you like. The technologies that have allowed for knowledge to be transmitted have been by and large static objects: books, textual documents. And it's only recently that the possibility of dynamical objects has come into existence—like Minecraft, for example. There's no doubt in my mind that in the future, constitution-like objects will be algorithmic and dynamical, because we can now do that. We couldn't in the past, and we don't yet have the design principles, the engineering principles, to use to build such things. But we shouldn't assume that the constraints of history dictates the form of these objects into the future. MichaelCertainly. Well David, this is such a deep and rich topic and I'm sure we'll have more time to discuss it in connection to next week's pieces…which are what by the way? DavidOh yeah. So this is another really interesting group—one that I imagine people are thinking about—which is the neurological implications of immobility, because now a lot of people are sedentary and that's not a good idea. What does neuroscience have to tell us about being sedentary for long prolonged periods of time. And all the way back issues in relation to what historical ancient societies did in times of of plague and famine. We'll be looking at that. We'll be looking at further mathematical and technical paradoxes associated with testing not so much the Bayesian question, but the challenges of not doing random testing and how that can lead you astray. Issues of radical uncertainty and limitations of some of these concepts like R0 and when they fail. MichaelExcellent. A reminder to everyone listening that Interplanetary Fest is putting out weekly course materials surrounding this information every Wednesday. You can go to interplanetaryfest.org and sign up for that, and then you get a really lovely curated, summarized briefing of these essays, and you can work through that with your family, and take quizzes. It's a great way to step this down and make this part of your own bespoke, modular education in a time of crisis.
30,Episode Details / Transcript Michael Garfield: All right, David. We're back for week five and this is again, I think if we carry this from the micro scale to the macro scale, there's a lot in here that links to topics that we've discussed on previous podcasts work that's been done by SFI faculty that has not shown up in the show yet. There's a lot to go on here. Let's start with Cris Moore's piece because this one I think connects really cleanly to a lot of work that's being done on, you know, network dynamics and social contagions and so on.  David Krakauer: Yes. So, Cris's brings us right back to the start, to this whole question of R-subzero, R-naught again, which is this number that we don't seem to be able to escape from, which tells us how many secondary infections we expect a primary infection to induce. Cris makes this really important point. If you go online, for example, now, and look up R-naught, you'll see an R-naught number associated with every virus, right? Different infections have different R-naughts. And the first point to make of course is that R-naught is not just a property of a virus; it's a property of its host. So it really doesn't make that much sense to assign an R-naught just to a pathogen, but you can because it's sort of averaged over the human population. And the whole point of Cris's contribution is to point out the dangers of averages.  Most of us know this already. I mean, you don't go into a clothes store and have them stock just the median size, right? The most common size. That would be useless, because they need sizes that are larger and smaller. So you consider the variance as well as the mean. R-zero is a mean in that same sense and he gives the following insight. Imagine that there are parts of the country where R-naught was greater than one and other parts of the country where R-naught was less than one. Or imagine there are populations where it was greater than one and less than one. You would still, when you present the average, conclude that the infection was sub-critical. Now, that means, by the way, a supercritical infection refers to an infection that leads to exponential growth, whereas subcritical is one that will peter out eventually. We've seen that ourselves in our own state here, Michael, because there are populations who might have preexisting conditions or there are all sorts of socioeconomic disparities that might increase the local R-naught. so McKinley County has the highest rate in New Mexico, where there are many Native Americans and so it's very dangerous to be reporting the average. In his contribution he goes through a number of very simple models where he shows that, in the first instance, imagine you have an R-naught that's less than one.  I think in his particular case it's 0.8. Even with that, you expect to see a variance, a distribution of outbreak sizes. If you were to observe the outbreak independently and say a different localities, most of them would be small. About 1% of them would be about 50 and in one of those localities it may go up as high as 80 even though the expected numbers with an R-naught of 0.8 would be five on average. So the average is dangerous because of regional variation. And then there's regional variation, if you like, in individuality, the so-called super-spreader and the super-spreader is an individual who infects many more people than the average. If you have a super-spreader that can generate, say, 20 secondary infections — in those cases you can have, even though the average is still low, the average outbreak might still be say five with you could have hundreds of individuals being infected. So the story here for Cris is: beware of the average, consider the variance, which leads you to a contemplation of what's called the heavy tail that there are in the, if you like, probability distribution outliers that are more common than you might have anticipated.  Michael Garfield: This links to the conversation I had with David Kinney on bringing in economic or energetic considerations into the issue of granularity in scientific investigation. At what level of resolution should we be asking the question? Or, to see it sort of inside out from that way, Mirta's work on the danger of drawing global conclusions from local samples and how by only looking at our immediate networks, we generate extraordinary biases about the world at large. Something in Cris's piece that I really appreciate is how it draws our attention back to something I see discussed a lot at SFI about multi-scale considerations. And you know, we've addressed this on the show a few times already. For example, the work that you and your co-authors just did on the information theory of individuality and the importance of being able to think of the individual as something that, you know, might be more conventionally understood, like a single person or perhaps an entire society. Like, how can we rigorously ask the question of whether this thing is bound as an individual in that way? So, you know, when he talks about the difference between thinking of this super-spreader individual versus super-spreading events and situations, I think that starts to give a sense of the importance of the multi-scale view in complex thinking as well as how that provides an entry point for asking at what scale should we be considering this in order to make the most useful pronouncements.  David Krakauer: Yeah, it is very important to bear that in mind, because you'll often observe that there are discrepancies between what you observe in your own community versus what's being reported on the news, which tends to be an average. And I think we have to develop a sophistication that allows us to understand how those two things relate. So, the national average might not be what you're experiencing at all. You might have a much harder time. And Cris's contribution gives us a quantitative insight into why that is expected to be true.Michael Garfield: Actually, I think this links pretty cleanly to something I want to discuss with you later in Stefani Crabtree's piece. But let's put a pin in that and let's move to the piece by Van Savage on testing capacity and the dangers of not being able to meet the actual spread of the disease with the number of tests we're administering.  David Krakauer: Yeah. So, you know, we discussed David's contribution last week about the whole challenge of inferring what the true, false positive–false negative rates on tests are. But there's another issue in relation to testing that Van raises, relating to the other great phrase that we're all hearing regularly, which is "flattening the curve." Now of course, "flattening the curve" refers to the time-dependent daily, weekly, monthly incidence or hospitalization rate and what contributes to that. And of course we will understand that we're isolating so as to minimize the transmissibility of the pathogen and thereby its negative consequences, hence "flattening the curve." But how do we know? The way we know is by testing and, Bayesian challenges aside, the point that Van makes is that there's an even more profound rudimentary constraint, which is who you test and the number of tests that you possess.  And he just makes this obvious point, right, that if the true number of cases is beyond the maximum testing capacity — which it is — and, in addition, you're testing people who present with symptoms — which we are — then what you're ultimately doing is reporting on noise. And the curve will appear to be flattening for pathological reasons. Let me just explain that a little bit more clearly. If the number of tests is much lower than the true number of infected, then what you're really reporting on is the number of tests, not the true underlying incidence. Take a sporting example. For example, the Rose Bowl in Pasadena or Wembley Stadium in London. Both of those hold about 90,000 fans. Let's say that you filled the stadium. You wouldn't conclude that there were only 90,000 football fans in the U.S. or U.K. — of course, they're different kinds of football fans — that you'd somehow reached the maximum popularity of their respective sports because they're saturating. And so the signal there is not truly informative of the true demand. It's limited supply. And the only way you could truly estimate how popular those two forms of football were would be to take random samples across stadia from all over the world. And that's precisely Van's point.  Michael Garfield: Again, you know, this is compounded by the issue that so many of the COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, you know, so it really does make filtering, trying to focus who and how we test a much more complicated issue, and it really does bring us back around to the importance of random testing.  David Krakauer: Exactly. The other point that Van makes is this issue of the exponentials. You know, a disease could be increasing exponentially and you have enough test kits to observe that or it could be that you have a huge number of infecteds that we hadn't realized — as you said, who were asymptomatic — but the testing capability is increasing exponentially, in which case it would look like exponential growth. Whereas in fact you'd already have saturated the numbers who are infected. So there are these interesting, if you like, perplexities of testing that you have to bear in mind. He goes on to present some simulations where he shows just how bad this problem is. You know, folks can read through those studies. But the key point here is there are only two options available to us: We either massively increase the testing capability or we test randomly.  This brings us, I think, to a general point I want to make again, which we've been doing throughout this series about the philosophy of the models and theory. When Van presents his simple simulations to demonstrate the challenge that we face, what he's doing is he's generating what we would call a null model. That is, we don't really know how to interpret data unless we have an expectation, and the expectation is established by a rigorous simulation. And we've talked about throughout this series other kinds of considerations. We've talked about the prior criterion. We've talked about issues in Cris's contribution about what I call the structure criterion, that is, the assumption of the mean field or the average. And so we're getting a bit of an instruction I think over the course of this pandemic into how model building actually works and what we should consider reliable and what we should remain suspicious of. Michael Garfield: Yeah, definitely. You know, just to generalize this a bit, for people who are more familiar with similar problems and related domains, this kind of problem comes up a lot when we're asking about changes in the incidence of diseases like cancer over the last 150 years, you know, or anything involving a spotty archaeological or paleontological, geological record that changes in species' distributions or volcanic eruptions over time. It brings us back to the same question that vans asking about whether we actually are observing a difference in the frequency of these events or whether we're observing an improvement in our ability to actually measure them. As that becomes harder and harder to figure, it brings us into the next piece, on making good decisions under uncertainty. This is a really cool piece because this is four authors, all of whom are focused on this particular issue of radical uncertainty. Why don't you lead us into this?  David Krakauer: Yeah, so this is a very active area of research, often associated with one of the authors here, Lenny Smith, and of course there are four of them, on this question of what do you do when you really don't know. That's what radical uncertainty is meant to convey, where the quantification of a cost and a consequence is highly contestable. But, nevertheless, you have to reach a conclusion and implement a policy. And what they present in this contribution is the point that very frequently the best statistical model that you could generate in earnestness with the best data that you have to hand will be vastly less informative in a deep sense than the cone of all possibilities. You know, in other words, it's a bit like Cris's point — the difference in the mean and the variance. You be better off knowing the variance than the mean. And we've seen this, of course, you know, yesterday U.S. corona-correlated deaths were about 60,000, and that was a number that surprised a lot of people because it wasn't expected to reach that level until about August.  And of course that's right because we had radical uncertainty about the projected trajectory. So, the question then is, if you can't report on probabilities because their data just aren't good enough to support that, what can you do? And this community has been arguing that, in addition to training people to get used to these presentations of the cone of uncertainty, the variances, and the higher moments of the distribution, but also to think about credible, what they call conviction narratives, which is you have to reach a conclusion. The data is not good enough, but a decision needs to be forthcoming. What are you going to do? And most of us, of course, in positions of leadership or having to make decisions, do this all the time. We weigh to the best of our ability these factors, and then we contrive or invent a narrative that makes sense of them that doesn't appear irrational or totalitarian.  This style of reasoning has become very popular. Actually, this year a book was written by John Kay and Mervyn King — and John, of course, is a frequent visitor to the Santa Fe Institute, very prominent economist. They wrote a book called Radical Uncertainty. In that book they do a very good job in some sense of dethroning the reigning probabilistic connotative school when it comes to domains of uncertainty. But they don't do such a good job in replacing it. They also argue for conviction narratives. And I'm very conscious of the fact that narratives can be very, very dangerous because they're very subject to cognitive biases. And we've talked about these in the past — you know, attribution biases, confirmation biases, framing biases, and so forth. And so I think my question in reading this was, it's a very compelling piece is what else is there?  I think we can take some pages out of mathematics. There are ways of reaching certainty, which have nothing to do with quantification. And people forget that. People often confound mathematical reasoning with quantitative reasoning. It's not. The Greek proofs in mathematics are very rarely quantitative; think about proofs in typology or geometry or logic. So I think what this raises for me is really a conversation about how we reach reasonable conclusions where quantity doesn't dominate, where we recognize the limitations of narrative. Are there other formalisms we might explore which give us means of acting without assigning numbers? And I think there are, actually, and this is I guess a conversation I would like to have with the authors.Michael Garfield: This evoked for me — and I'm curious how you see this — in business culture, there's the famous OODA loop, you know, observe, orient, decide, act that was developed by a United States Air Force colonel, John Boyd. You know, this is how to make decisions rapidly under conditions of great uncertainty as a fighter pilot. And that's where he said, you know, if you think about your narrative as the direction you're pointing the plane, right? You know, calling back to Manfred Laublicher's piece on fitness landscapes, the authors for this piece say, crucially, optimization in radical uncertainty is dangerous because its premises are not satisfied on a fitness landscape. It's like, in a period of cataclysmic change, the fitness landscape shifts, as we have discussed in previous episodes. There are valleys where mountains used to be. And if you continue to optimize for the mountain of your narrative, then you're going to walk off a cliff.  David Krakauer: Yeah. You know it's very difficult, because we don't really have many alternatives. I was very convinced in about, I think it was 2018, I read a book called The Tyranny of Metrics by Jerry Muller. And he's basically making this point that we've gone from measuring performance to fixating on measurement itself. Science is full of this. I mean, most of us are nauseated by this idea of the H-index, which is a means of measuring scientific popularity, and that's the key point. It measures scientific popularity, not scientific profundity, and these indices which have been proliferating across different sectors are essentially a substitute for judgment. I do think that this article raises a question that we have to address in all walks of life, where quantification is spurious rigor and I feel it's that important that we should at the Institute be thinking very carefully about it. I tend to like logical simulation environments generating, if you like, the cone of uncertainty through a principled set of null models which at least gives you a sense of the full space of counterfactuals which you can then use to navigate. But I think it's very open territory.Michael Garfield: As you did last week, calling to orthogonal discussions that we've held at InterPlanetary festival. Your piece on counterfactuals and null models is a callback to the world-building panel that we held last year with James S. A. Corey and Rebecca Roanhorse and Michael Drought on how the work of science-fiction authors helps us do this in a non-quantitative way. Allows us to speculate — and this is possibly why the work of science-fiction authors has become so useful in a very rapidly moving business environment in helping us map the full spectrum of possible scenarios. Right? Like that's why you've got Neal Stephenson on the list of former Miller Scholars.  David Krakauer: Yeah, that's exactly right. I mean, I've described narrative as ontology engines a number of times. I mean, I think that is actually what they mean, the authors, by narrative and conviction narratives. I think great authors do precisely that. And Neal is a great example of someone who has some of the most sophisticated reasoning about the near-term future of the economy, say, or technologies, because he's exploring that counterfactual space. But I think that there must be alternatives to that, that we could somehow conjoin the best of narrative with the best of modeling to create a real engine that allows us to generate alternative possibilities. And I don't think we have such a thing yet.  Michael Garfield: Let's act as if we can. You know, moving from that, let's take a dog leg here. It's a little harder to find a clear through line into the work by your brother John Krakauer and Michelle Carlson. But it's a really interesting piece on spiraling frailty and the importance of physical exercise encountering some of the worst effects of this disease.  David Krakauer: Yeah, so, obviously, I'm somewhat biased. It's a very interesting article, partly because it was written by my brother and a colleague, but what they're raising is the question I think that many of us are asking, sitting at home: How do we remain active? How do we remain healthy? And these alarming observations that the COVID virus, in addition to immobilizing very many of us, is actually attacking individuals who have conditions that are compounded through sedentary lifestyles. So the article begins with this discussion of frailty, which is a real biological syndrome that about 10% of Americans have, that's associated with various clinical components, including, you know, muscle tissue loss, a slowing down of gait, a significant reduction of physical activity, that feeling of always being low energy or being exhausted and so forth. And this syndrome increases markedly over the age of 65 and we can't but notice that the age of 65 is that kind of magic category where you become significantly more susceptible to the coronavirus.  It's the group of 65 up that are most vulnerable to this infection and are experiencing the highest hospitalization rates. So it looks as if there is a synergy between these two things and the frailty is often unmasked or amplified by a perturbation such as this infection. In the medical community, John and Michelle make this point that there is a preference to treat conditions with monotherapies. We can attack that single system with a single drug and the fact is that most of us know it doesn't work. Right? And in the case of energy, estrogen or testosterone replacement therapy would be a good example. And they cite the work of Linda Fried, who defined frailty syndrome, and she makes this really interesting point that the extraordinary thing about physical activity is that it's not a monotherapy. It actually up-regulates many systems that are necessary to maintain health and they're particularly effective at ameliorating two chronic diseases, hypertension and type-two diabetes that are the primary co-morbidities with coronavirus infection.  So it's really quite deep. It's not just you're better off exercising because it will reduce your susceptibility, but those groups, if you like, that are most susceptible stand to benefit most. I think that point was really important. The other point that they make is how might we intervene on the system that is the entire-body system. And one point that they're making here is that there is a reluctance to engage in physical activity. It can be psychologically trying. You might feel as if you're not healthy enough even to begin, and John has been a very strong advocate for game-like environments which you can conduct without judgment, which are extraordinarily fun and can encourage relatively high levels of mobility inside the house. Think about things like Wii Sports or Beat Saber or Ring Fit Adventure. All of these are games which ask you to move. They're fun to engage in, the activation energy required to engage in them is relatively low,  like going for a five- or six-mile run. And I think they're arguing that perhaps this kind of technology might be important complement to regular forms of physical activity outside in times when you're being asked to socially isolate.Michael Garfield: It's funny in kind of a similar way to the way that this pandemic has driven so many social gatherings online kind of prematurely before we can really engage in a robust simulacrum of what it actually to meet with one another in embodied physical spaces. It feels like we're right at the point here where this has happened to us early enough that we're still sort of climbing up from base camp in terms of the way that embodied physical computing — you know, the actual potential here. The plans that were popularized by films like Minority Report where you're not just sitting at a desk typing on a thing as as I and several of us at SFI are now trapped in a sedentary work environment and really have to force ourselves out of the seat. But, in addition to the games that you listed, you know, I've been seeing ads for games like these balancing boogie board-type deals with video games built in, where the video game controller is your body. And that's really exciting. But you know, to your first point, I feel like what they're getting at is something that I see brought up again and again in the underlying hidden patterns, the generalities that are opened up and revealed through complex-systems science, specifically in relationship to understanding things, again, as multi-scale networks. And this piece in particular reminded me of the work of Jennifer Dunne on trophic networks and the conversations that we had about this way back in episodes five and six. You know, where it's like, if you think about the causal relationships in the body, like a food web, then physical exercise might be like the keystone species. If you remove it then the entire web collapses, and it's really important to identify it if you know in the, analogically, the conservation efforts that you apply to your body ecology.  David Krakauer: Yeah, I think it's this very interesting shift of perspective that comes with familiarity with complexity. This notion of a systemic intervention. You know, in their article they cite this new book by Peter Sterling called What is Health? And he makes this point that a complex therapeutic intervention — and he's interested in the case of hypertension or diabetes — is not that you begin with a antihypertensive or anti-diabetic polypharmacological intervention, but you do exercise, right? You move. And it seems to many people a little counterintuitive. And there is something that needs to be explained about our reluctance to engage in activities that are extraordinarily beneficial to health, which have very low costs. These are not pharmacological interventions. Why are we reluctant to take those, but we are so willing to spend huge sums of money on pills which do far, far less? And I think one of the areas where this has been very obvious has been depression, right?  So this is a real area of concern. We treat them with antidepressants, they have significant side effects, but one of the most effective means of treating depression is with exercise. And so I think that John and Michelle are getting at a really interesting point: are there technologies like gaming, for example, which would make exercise feel as legit as taking a drug? Somehow hanging them on an armature of engineering gives them a placebo-like salience that they might not have if we just step outside to go for a run. And this is a psychological challenge for us that we all need to face.  Michael Garfield: Yeah. I wonder to what extent this is due to the fact that we have sort of eroded the topsoil culturally in terms of the ways that we're able to look to the lessons of human history for how people in other cultures have addressed comparable issues in their own times. You know, that we tend to think of our time as radically different than other moments in history. And so we leave questions about the innate benefits of health and well-being to someone through gardening and the way that gardening helps cultivate a person's microbiome and exposes them to sunlight and keeps them physically active and so on. Because we're not sort of economically motivated to draw those analogies or we're motivated to believe that our times are unique and call for modern, high-technological interventions.David Krakauer: Yeah. You know, it's interesting, Michael. I think it comes down to insufficient appreciation of complexity. I like to think about this in terms of causality and I think you raised it, which is, we're energy-minimizing cognitive systems. And if we can find dominant mono-causal explanations, we prefer them and probably for good reasons. But that leads us astray and it does lend a cognitive bias to us which disposes us towards solutions that look as if they're single silver bullets. And what we now know, I think, about health, about mental health, physical health, is that they are the convergence of many different systems and that they have to be treated with something as complex as they are. Right? It's a little bit like education that we discussed in relation to Carrie's. You can pretend that learning is simple and have a correspondingly simple pedagogy or you can recognize it's not and explore the full panoply of possibilities. And I think it's exactly the same here. Medicine will evolve by recognizing the complexity of the body and pursuing complex interventions. Physical exercise and sleep are two very good examples of that.  Michael Garfield: So yeah, again, there's a link here to the first piece we discussed in this call and Cris's caution around R-naught, the average, is exactly what you're saying here. It appeals to our desire for a simple story and the link to David Kinney's work and his insistence on the inclusion of context in our philosophy of how we address specific scientific questions, that it's unpopular in philosophy to insist that there's a "yeah, but," that there's conditional considerations. People want to be able to make sweeping universal claims. And the reality is that that's, you know, insufficiently detailed, right? I mean, it's not going to get us there.  David Krakauer: Yeah, I agree. I agree with that.  Michael Garfield: So let's move on to Stefani Crabtree's piece. I think this is a really simple and inspiring statement that she is making about the importance of reflecting on historical precedent here.  David Krakauer: Yeah, I mean, we had already talked in relation to the frightening economic downturn that this is one depression among many or one opportunity among many and the same goes for the experience of plagues and epidemics and famines and Stefani opens her piece by making the observation that the practice of quarantine that we are now experiencing derives from a 14th-century Venetian convention of keeping ships at harbor to protect the citizens of the city-state from pathogens. And she goes on to discuss the plague of Athens in the fifth century, which killed one-third of the city-state's population. And the value of narrative, of historical narrative, by Thucydides and others in helping us come to terms with that plague. How in fact he describes the spread of fear as moving more quickly than the spread of the plague. It's something that we discussed in relation to the infection of memes as opposed to the infection of viral genes.  And so there is a historical context that all civilizations have experienced and learned to cope with. But I think where the article becomes more serious, which is something that we haven't yet discussed in as much detail as I'm sure we will, is in terms of the social upheavals and implications of these plagues. Stefani herself has worked for a long time on Southwestern archaeology, in particular studying the Chaco culture. And this is the culture right here, very close to us, which thrived between the 10th and the 12th centuries, but experienced a very precipitous decline when the ancestral Puebloans left. And there are all sorts of hypotheses for why this is true, many of them having to do with drought and severe shortages in protein. But the point is it led to significant escalations in warfare and violence and that connection, not just between disease and markets, but between disease and civil unrest, is something that I'm sure is at the back of many of our minds.  So that's a very important point. I was reminded, in fact, when reading through Stefani's, of a book that I read a couple of years ago by Kyle Harper called The Fate of Rome, and the great book on The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire was written by Edward Gibbon. And in Gibbon's book, the empire declines for two reasons, really. One is self-destructive religious superstition, and the other is warfare at its boundaries. And what Harper is arguing is that we've overstated those social factors and underestimated the importance of of climate and epidemics. And of course he talks at length about the Antonine Plague, which was in the second century A.D., where a thriving Roman Empire under Augustus was brought to its knees by smallpox. It's a little bit like our bull market that was brought to its knees by the coronavirus. And so that's another example where we tend to underestimate certain invisible factors, certain complex causes, in favor of the standard explanations and what Kyle Harper goes on to do, actually, in that book is show that, right after the Antonine plague, just as Roman society was recovering, Rome experienced what's called the late antique little ice age, which was very, very unfavorable to agriculture. And so one catastrophe came on the heels of another and that compounding effect really brought the empire down, as opposed to the standard Gibbon explanation. Many of us are talking about climate now and if the climate catastrophe should begin to become more apparent on the heels of the coronavirus catastrophe, society is in for a real battle. Michael Garfield: Yeah. It'll look somewhat similar to coronavirus infecting someone who's already suffering from spiraling frailty. Right. Just for listeners, you know, Kyle Harper gave a presentation at our symposium last year on this book that was extremely fascinating and I think can be filed under a long list of rather prophetic presentations by people at SFI including Lauren Ancel Meyers's work on preventing the next pandemic for last year's Ulam lectures. And you can find all of that stuff on our YouTube channel if you want to go deeper into that.  David Krakauer: Yeah, Michael, I do want to point out, I think that you make a really good point about non-obvious analogies between Kyle Harper's work and John and Michelle's points, which again relate to this complex-systems perspective, that it's very rarely the case that interesting or dramatic phenomena have simple causes. And one of the dangers, I think, of the current crisis is this collapse of the dimension of causality to a single cause, that is, the virus. Forgetting that much of what we're observing is pre-existing inequalities of susceptibility or economic circumstance amplifying the effects of a virus. And that is important to bear in mind. And I'm hoping that this series is contributing to that kind of insight.Michael Garfield: You know, relatedly, to call back to Doug Erwin's commentary on mass extinctions. You know, I think most people similarly look for a silver bullet when we're trying to understand, you know, earth history. And over the last 15 years or so there's been a shift in the way that we understand mass extinctions as complex events that are caused by the compounding of factors like we're talking about here. Most people, thanks to Louis and Walter Alvarez, have it in their minds that the end Cretaceous mass extinction was triggered by an asteroid impact. But at the same time, this was concurrent with a 2-million-year volcanic eruption in what is now India that caused climate change, that there were changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry, there were the emergence of land bridges. You know, when I was studying this stuff, my mentor Robert Bakker talked a lot about the way that organisms were changing their migration patterns and he really insisted that pandemic disease transmission also probably played a very large role in the extinction of the dinosaurs. You know.So, again, it's just yet another example where like you said, we have to be careful about oversimplifying the story here.David Krakauer: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.Michael Garfield: There's one more link I'd like to make because you brought it up with Stefani's piece. When she's talking about the fall of the Chaco Canyon society, she mentions that, when productivity failed, the Chacoan hierarchical society fractured, violence increased, and society reorganized into regional communities that issued hierarchy. So this calls back to Miguel Fuentes and his work on how social graphs disintegrate in crisis, and Tony Eagan's piece on the balance between federal and state governance and disasters, and how you suggested that maybe acclimating to the challenges that we're facing today might require dynamic constitutions that can become more or less strict in their regulation depending on the needs of the moment. I feel like we're at a point in the series now where we can start to trace the outline of a more general systems way of thinking about these things.  You know, that we can understand why it would be that the societies that came up after the fall of Rome or after the fall of Chaco or the sort of specter of Balkanization that's lingering over us now are actually not just a failure of a coherent system, but actually an adaptation to a crisis that's happening faster than the latencies of a massive and unified institutional response can address with respect to on-the-ground conditions. It becomes very difficult for the general to conduct the war when something bizarre is happening rapidly on every front, more emergency local elections, more self-organizing duocracies that we see spring up in disaster relief. I'm curious how you understand this in terms of the insights that complexity science can offer us in adaptive strategies for social organization on the other side of this.David Krakauer: Yeah. I think one useful mantra might be, complex causality requires complex control or complex intervention and the history of thought is a history of low-hanging fruit. We start with the simplest things that we can intervene into in the simplest way. We see an apple fall from a tree and with remarkable ingenuity arrive at a theory of gravity. We develop engineering techniques of ballistics that are mirrors of that world. But when you get to the complex world, things don't work that way anymore. Things are connected in subtle ways. There are non-linearities. There are different phases and critical transitions and we're just at the baby steps of understanding how to intervene into complex systems. And the last thing we want to do is pretend that they're simple systems. And I think that's what we have been doing. And I think a number of these contributions that we've been reading over the last few weeks are pointing out the challenges and dangers of doing that. And today we've arrived at this point where we're getting an insight into what systemic intervention and control might look like. And the good news is it's available to us and available to us not at considerable cost, at least in relation to health.  Michael Garfield: So where are we going with this next week? What do we have on the table?  David Krakauer: Well, that will be an exciting one. Next week we'll be discussing cities, cities as the engines, if you like, of the pandemic, but also potentially as the creative centers that might arrive at solutions. We'll be talking about mechanism design, how an economy functions when it doesn't have a market and what we can replace the market with. The return of the wild. That world out there that we have left to itself has been doing remarkably well without us. The uncertainties associated with exponential processes and the dark matter and dark energy of microbial life.  Michael Garfield: Well, I look forward to that and I'll talk to you next week.  David Krakauer: Thank you.
31,Episode Details / Transcript Michael Garfield:    All right, well, this week we have a set of really sort of fundamental and potent contributions to the series and I look forward to diving in with you here.David Krakauer:   It's a rich one.Michael Garfield:   So as we have come to kind of formalize this, let's start in the micro with David Wolpert’s piece on the Landauer bound. This was a really cool one.David Krakauer:   Yeah, this is really interesting, it's a field that I’ve found fascinating, and of course, it’s of big interest here at the Santa Fe Institute. I think of David's contribution is the ‘virus as a computer virus,’ and it's all about the energetics of computation. It introduces energetic limits to computation, how they're connected to this idea of the extended phenotype and the virus as a minimal replicator that outsources its functions to its host. And it’s worth, in this case, just do a little history:When the great Alan Turing invented his famous thought experiment that led to the computer, called the Turing machine, to prove an undecidability theorem in 1936, the computer was a completely idealized logical construct. It didn't live in the physical world. It was a mathematical thought experiment. And he devised that thought experiment to answer a question, that is, can an algorithm tell you in advance whether or not a problem can be solved? The answer, famously, was no. This construct that Turing invented, called the Turing machine, has an infinite tape and you write binary strings to the tape and you can erase these strings, but there's no friction in the Turing tape, right? The Turing computer doesn't live in the physical world, it lives in a kind of mathematical utopia. And a physicist working at IBM in the 1960s became very interested with this fact that most real computers do live in the physical world.  That means that they're subject to all the laws of physics, like the laws of thermodynamics. In this case, the most important of which is the second law: that entropy increases in any closed system. And he formulated the second law for computation, called the Landauer Principle, and it basically says that any logical manipulation of information of the sort that Turing envisaged –– writing bits, raising bits, combining bits –– will generate heat, and that heat will be dissipated into the environment. This was important, because it led to limits to militarization because as we pack more and more transistors in integrated circuits, they generate more and more heat and at some point the circuit as a whole will melt. So, a virus is a little bit like a very tiny computer. But the virus is an organic computer and its Turing tape, if you like, is its genome, the sequence of RNA bases.And what the virus computes is the function “copy.” It gets into the cell and it copies its RNA genome. And what David points out is the virus, like any computers, should be subject to the Landauer constraints, which would put a limit on how much information it can encode. What the virus ingeniously does is outsource almost all the computational work to the host. And that's where this extended phenotype concept comes in –– sometimes also called ecosystem engineering, or niche construction –– where the virus basically allows us to in some sense do the bulk of the work. So, the virus doesn't encode all the ribosome complex…we do, right? We encode the Turing tape head. And, by virtue of outsourcing to its host, most of the computational work, the virus gets away with being an extraordinarily efficient little bit of computer code.That's why I alluded at the beginning to David's contribution of a virus as a computer virus. Which leads to this very counterintuitive fact that most of the virus is not virus. Most of the virus is, in fact us, because we contribute most of the machinery necessary for it to complete its life cycle. One way to think about this is like technology. So, we talk about iPhones as these miracles of miniaturization, but that's only partly true because most of what the iPhone does is actually outsource to vast server farms that are cooled by river systems. So the phone is a bit like a technological virus that heats up the world in order that you can keep this cool piece of glass in your pocket.Timothy Morton, the philosopher of ecology calls it a hyper-object. It's an object that only partly lives in the dimension of your immediate experience, most of which is out of sight. And as computing trends move towards outsourcing computation, they're becoming more and more viral. So there's this beautiful physics of computation link that David points out between the microbial world and the macroscopic world of technology.Michael Garfield:    You know, this brings us to this overarching theme in the series about the problems of bringing over-simple models to complex situations. When we had you on the show way back at its beginning, for the live recording at InterPlanetary Fest last year on the origins of life course offered by Complexity Explorer, someone in the audience asked the classic “is a virus alive” question. Well, that's a binary question for which there is not a binary answer, right? I mean you just lead-authored a piece on an information theory of individuality where this kind of question you and your coauthors…I really enjoyed this piece, the way that you talk about different kinds of individuals that are scaffolded in different ways by the environment, and how we tend to think of the individual as more or less only the kind of individual that humans believe ourselves to be. That we have a sort of internal driver and informational continuity that pushes us forward in time. It's this classic nature vs. nurture question.And then, with the Landauer bound and the extended phenotype, bringing this subtlety that you addressed in that paper: where does the spider end? The web allows the spider to be small and to outboard most of that sensitivity to the web, which is really light and comparably easier to build than an enormous spider body that would have to sit there and sense the whole thing.David Krakauer:   Yeah, that's absolutely right. I think that our perceptual apparatus operates on preferred space and timescales, and doesn't see the spider for what it really is, which is, as you say, is spider plus web plus… Truly, individuals are these much more interesting hyper-objects which extend into the world in complicated ways. Human beings are their genomes, their bodies, their social networks, their homes, their cities… And the key question of course, in that work was trying to determine where you should draw a boundary in a principled way. It has something to do with causality which is, where does your causality, the center of causality extend out and attenuate to the point where you have no more control? So yes, I think that there needs to be a real revolution in how we think about what objects are, particularly adaptive objects. Partly for conservation reasons, because, if you believe that your cell phone is just that thing that you carry that you can charge every night when you go to bed with a regular charger; and you forget that part of that phone is actually somewhere hidden away drawing down huge quantities of energy that are radiating out heat, then there's a sense in which you're not truly responsible for your extended phenotype. So, there are ethical implications of rethinking what the individual is.Michael Garfield:   Yeah. And in that movement towards a deeper apprehension of our identity as hyper-objects, outboarding the cost of viral reproduction allows the very small to drive the very large.  I think a lot of listeners are probably familiar with Bucky Fuller's analogy of the trim tab on the rudder of the Queen Mary, and how that tiny little thing can push a much larger craft, and steer it in a different direction. That brings us to Sid Redner’s piece on exponentials, and how important it is to embrace the enormous range in a lot of these epidemiological models, because they're inherent in the nature of grappling with an exponential phenomenon.David Krakauer:   So the consequence of all of that efficiency that David described, whereby the virus outsources its essential computational machinery to us is the possibility of exponentials.So, we pay the entropic cost for viral overpopulation, not the virus. And exponentials are notoriously hard to get your brain around. In popular culture, they're behind the so-called Butterfly Effect in chaotic dynamics. That's where you have two arbitrarily close initial conditions, where the two associated trajectories diverge exponentially in time. So, exponentials are what we are talking about when we say extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. That's the Butterfly Effect. Sid gives this example from compound interest, which is the exponential that most of us know from our bank accounts. And he makes his point. You deposit a dollar with an outrageous interest rate, say 5% per day, and in about nine months you'd have a million dollars, right? When he says it’s a 10% interest rate, you'd be a millionaire in just under five months. That's exponentials. The one that I like, because I think it's even more crazy to come to terms with, is the consequence of Moore's law.Folks will remember Moore's law is this empirical observation that the number of transistors and so forth in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. And this is a very general technological observation. Take this one: In the 1960s, a gigaflop of processing power –– a gigaflop is about 1000 floating point operations per second –– cost $18 billion. In the 1980s that costs 20 million. In the year 2000, you get a gigaflop for about a $1000, and iPhone X, which costs about $500 on eBay, runs at 600 gigaflops. Now here's the weird thing about exponentials. That means that if you could time travel just to the 1960s with your $500 iPhone, it would be worth hundreds, if not thousands, of billions of dollars. In other words, your $500 iPhone is a trillion-dollar hyper-object.Michael Garfield:   Well, I mean that's, if you could travel back with the entire network architecture that supports it, right…David Krakauer:   Yeah, that's a very good point! That's a very good point, but to be fair, the actual chip on the phone is running at 600 gigaflops. It wouldn't be very useful; you couldn't do much with it. But that little device contains, you know, by 1960’s standards, trillions of dollars of technology. So that's what exponentials do.Okay, let's get back to Sid. Sid is making the point that R-naught, which we've talked about a lot, is like the interest rate of the viral investment in its hosts. So we are the virus’s genome bank and the virus does not make more money, it makes more genomes. That's its profit. So if you start with one infection, COVID has an R-naught of about 2.5, that's a 250% interest rate. That's pretty high. At those rates you not only get huge returns, but you could potentially get huge variations in return. And this takes us to the Cris Moore insight about long tails. It's a very similar style of reasoning in this article. So, here's a simple mathematical model where you basically say, let's imagine that our social distancing policies…we don't have to imagine it, it's true…are aimed at reducing our not below one.  Of course, you can't do that overnight, policies aren't perfect. So he says, let's assume that every day you can reduce from 2.5 in some range between 10% and 0%. So, on average the daily decrease would be about 5%. That means you're expected to drop beneath 1 in about 20 days. But of course we've already established that that's the average, between 10% and 0%, so there'll be variation, and because this is an exponential, this leads to massive differences in outbreak sizes.So, even though you could reduce it in about 20 days, let’s say on average, the size of the epidemic could vary between a hundred times the initial number of infected to about 10,000 times the initial number of infected. This is again, like Moore's law, one of those very counterintuitive outcomes that relates to the uncertainty. Not the uncertainty of ignorance, but the uncertainty of the Butterfly Effect. Exponentials build this other kind of radical uncertainty into our models, which has nothing to do with ignorance, or a little bit to do with it, but moreover to do with the non-linearities that can massively amplify tiny measurement errors, or tiny differences in initial conditions.Michael Garfield:    That calls pretty directly to, if people want to go deeper into that, Michael Hochberg's piece that we discussed in the second episode of the series on the importance of timing. And then more largely this cuts across articles we've discussed by Lenny Smith, by Jurgen Jöst, Simon Dedeo, Melanie Mitchell and this issue we've addressed here on embracing radical uncertainty. I really liked Redner’s point that in some ways, whether you saturate the system or you saturate it five times over, is kind of beside the point. That the initial investment in some ways matters less than the exponent and when you start investing, So, at what point do we accept this and act on it? This is linked to Chris Kempes’s and Geoff West's piece, in that we live in a world now where exponentials are not only difficult for a lot of people to grasp, but also much like hyper objects, they’re a central feature, a dominant feature of our world, because we live in cities.David Krakauer:   Yes. So this has been, of course, the subject of Geoffrey's work for a long time, and this is a very nice contribution from Chris and Geoff. You know, it was not until about around 2007 when for the first time in history more human beings lived in cities than in rural populations. The history of humanity by and large has been a rural history, and our institutions and our intuitions come from that world. But the point that Chris and Geoff are making is that cities are kind of time-travel machines. They speed everything up. They increase the rate parameters of these exponentials for all sorts of different processes. So, let's get to the virus. It's been observed that over two thirds of all COVID-19 cases in the U.S. comes from about eight jurisdictions, and all of those are concentrated around cities.Transmission spread and potential mitigation are all tied to an understanding of the dynamics of cities. What Geoff has shown in the past about cities are very interesting regularities, the best known of which is that socioeconomic quantities (wages, patents, wealth) all scale super-linearly in population size, which means that the wealth scales as the [size of the city] raised to a [power], and that power tends to be 1.15. So you get a compounding effect of 15% per doubling. There's a direct connection to Sid here, if you like, with an exponential process this exponential in time, then the rate parameter will vary with the [city size] raised to this [power.] What that means is that a city with a million people will double the number of cases in half the time a city of 10,000. That's like the Moore's law, there’s this huge exponential effect of being larger.And the neat thing about this work that I find really intriguing, and I have to say when I first saw it of course many years ago, very surprising, is that it's not just things like patents and wealth that scale to this power, but also the rate of disease transmission. So, we've talked earlier in this series about the connections between memetics and genetics, but cities are a very interesting machine because they impose through mechanisms that we still don't fully understand this extraordinary universality on the way very different transmission dynamics work. In the city, disease transmission scales the way wealth scales and those are really amazing results that we have to understand.The reason that's important, I think for culture, is that there's been so much emphasis in this period on understanding epidemiology, understanding virology…The Gates Foundation that's been extraordinary in its funding of disease has declared that it will dedicate all of its funds towards COVID, and that's a huge problem because it's one factor in this multidimensional hyper object, if you like, that we call “the city.” To understand these kinds of complex events means not disaggregating them and treating epidemics as if they're independent of the economy, which they’re clearly not. The city is a super integrator of complex phenomenology where you can take nothing for granted. So I think what Chris and Geoff are really arguing for here is that in just the same way that we have surveillance systems and prediction systems for weather and for tsunamis and for earthquakes, we need to think very carefully about having very thoughtful, rigorous surveillance, and theories of surveillance, for the integrated set of phenomena that all adhere to the same scaling laws. Because the city, as I said before, imposes convergence on their collective dynamics.Michael Garfield:    Last year when she was at InterPlanetary Festival, Ann Pendleton-Julian had a really lovely riff on something that you just touched on, which is that we're not just talking about cities as one network, that sort of one dimensional thing, but it's a multidimensional thing that includes the infrastructure, the environmental resources, the complex political, economic and social systems, the stories that we tell, one another, the virtuality that we inhabit now that we're distancing from one another physically… A lot of us seem to be engaged in more social instances per day with this proliferation of video calls. Last week when we were discussing understanding this complexity in terms of identifying points of systemic intervention, Luis Bettencourt in episode four of this show talked about his research on intervening in slums by finding ways to bring new vasculature into the slums to allow for better distribution of resources in infrastructural networks. But then, you know, Cris Moore talks about how understanding the hidden structure under the average of R-naught allows us to find points of intervention for lowering the node-degree to slow the transmission of virus. Your point about surveillance needing to integrate across all of these dimensions…it's too simple to say, “let's grow the network to solve problems” or to say, “let's break the network to solve problems.” It's understanding how to modulate that across many different dimensions at once.David Krakauer:    Yes, I would make two points here, Michael. The first is, why have we heard so much from the epidemiologists and so little from the economists? Even though for many people, for the majority of people, COVID is an economic catastrophe, not a health catastrophe. And the reason for that is because we have models and principles of transmission where points of intervention are understood and principles of vaccine development are somewhat understood. Whereas when we talk about economic markets, we don't have comparable insight and we'll get to that with Eric's piece. And so I think one of the deeper points being made here is that we now know that there are these scaling laws that unify biological and cultural phenomenon, and if the underlying dynamics on the fractal infrastructure of the city are what give rise to these universalities, it does suggest the possibility of a very principled understanding of economic response, not just epidemic response. So I view that as the deeper point here, that it's time to take complexity very seriously in order to be as useful in responding to the socioeconomic catastrophe as we have been in responding to the healthcare catastrophe.Michael Garfield:   Indeed. Maskin’s piece is really interesting in light of this question of what happens when we use an insufficiently complex model. Like you were just saying, we look at it across only one dimension. And actually, for Vox EDU, Wendy Carlin and Sam Bowles just published this lovely piece on the revival of the civic society. Rather than thinking of things as merely just “the market” or “the state,” and allowing one or the other of those to drive those things, but to understand how we need to fill this in so that governance is operating at multiple scales at once. I think we can get to this idea that this is a way in which economics is related to evolutionary questions, like what forces lead to different kinds of nervous system architectures. And when is it good to have a head, or not have a head? Maybe that's skipping ahead. Let's talk about what happens when the city breaks, when the market doesn't work fast enough to address the problems that we're facing.David Krakauer:    Yes. Yeah. That's what to the extent that this crisis has shown us, that these systems are coupled. It also shows us how they all break together, and Eric's contribution is what do we do when we don't have markets. Of course, we don't have markets, we do in some sense, but by virtue of social distancing, market efficiency is compromised and the pricing mechanism that mediates supply and demand doesn't work. And Eric is one of the inventors of the solution to this problem and the solution is called Mechanism Design. Eric won the Nobel prize with Hurwicz and Myerson in 2007 for this work. Just a nice footnote on SFI history here, because Eric is a longstanding member of our science board, but Eric himself as an undergraduate stumbled into a course being taught by Ken Arrow on information economics. And Ken, of course, was one of the founders of the Santa Fe Institute who had won the Nobel prize himself in 1972, and he inspired Eric to pursue this work, particularly through his familiarity with the work of Hurwicz.So I need to explain a little bit where mechanism design comes in by explaining what game theory is. And I apologize cause I'm sure most folks know this, but a little bit of background on this, because it's important. Game theory, perhaps we know, is associated with extraordinary figures like John Von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern and John Nash. And the essential idea behind game theory is to find the best strategy to use in a game. What’s a game? Well the game has a set of agents –– Think of chess –– us, the players. There are strategy options, and there are payoffs associated with playing those strategies against one another. And most importantly there is a solution concept, that is this choice of strategy that is the best against all other strategy, which gives you the highest payoff that allows you to win the game. And what game theory does is it looks for those solutions. It looks for their accessibility and it looks for their stability.The most famous of which of course is the Nash equilibrium. Now, mechanism design turns that on its head. Sometimes mechanism design is called “reverse game theory,” because it doesn't look for the solution given the strategy set and the agents. It starts with the solution. It says, “this is where we want to be,” and then it asks how would we go about defining the strategies and the payoffs to ensure that that solution is reached? And if you think about a market, it's made up of strategies: strategies of buyers, strategies of sellers, and the pricing mechanism is a mechanism of the market that ensures under very idealized conditions, of course, that at least for a short while some fixed point –– a Nash solution –– is reached that satisfies the majority of suppliers and consumers…one hopes. So, if the market has gone, what do you do? How does mechanism design work for something as complicated as a market?And it sounds arcane, but most people interact with mechanism design regularly through auctions like eBay or by voting. And here the objective is, we want to elect the preferred candidate, or we want to maximize the profit of the seller. So the mechanism design in those cases is how you design the voting system, or how you design the auction to achieve the goal. The example that everyone will know, that Eric often gives is imagine, Michael, that we're both super greedy. Now of course you are and I'm not, but let’s, for the sake of a thought experiment, imagine we both are.Michael Garfield:   I think we just failed the prisoner's dilemma…David Krakauer: …and we are given a cake and you get to cut up the cake. Now imagine that you get to cut the cake up, and you also get to divvy it up. Under those conditions, unfortunately, you'll get a very big chunk of cake and I'll get a tiny piece.  That's what's called a “tragedy of the commons,” because your selfish interests don't maximize the social welfare function, the wellbeing of everyone, which in this case is two people. Mechanism Design comes to the rescue. And the mechanism in this case that most people will know is one person cuts the cake, and the other person chooses. If you do that then there's actually no incentive to take more than half, so you get a fair sharing of the cake. This is the key to mechanism design: the key underlying principle is you have a tragedy of the common situation, you want somehow to reach fairness, and the way you do it is by outsourcing the utility function to others. And Eric discusses the more technical case of how we would distribute fairly ventilators to treat the acute condition of COVID infection without a market.We all saw in the news this spontaneous emergence of aberrant auctions in which state governors were bidding against each other very inefficiently to try and save lives. And the point that Eric's making is we can do better than that! The mathematics of Mechanism Design shows how. This article while on the surface is arithmetically a little bit challenging, it’s actually quite simple: the idea is that buyers and sellers all report their preferred costs to the so-called mechanism, in that case, that would be a federal agency of some kind. And the mechanism creates a payment rule for both parties. The key is just like that divide and choose mechanism of the cake, is to align the individual incentive with the global social welfare function. And so, all mandatory transfers from the mechanism turn each of our personal utilities into social utility.That's what the mathematics does. It provides an incentive to both buyer and seller to do the right thing. Sometimes this is called the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Mechanism, and the essential concept is always that one: you turn the individual utility-maximizing strategy into the social utility-maximizing strategy.There are some simple examples I can give. Economists often talk about externalities. These are the things that are not typically on the spreadsheet, right? In other words, they're the hidden cost to the world of trade and production. So for example, you might be manufacturing bricks, but in the process emitting a huge amount of toxic pollutants. But here's what a mechanism would do. It would say your cost to production are proportional to the damage to the environment. Well, if that was your true cost, then there would be every incentive for you to reduce the pollution and deal with the tragedy of the commons, and achieve the fair outcome. The critical point about mechanism design is it's not despotic. It's not the command economy that says thou shalt produced x levels of y. It says you still choose, you can still make a profit, but we're going to tell you how much you're going to make and incentivize you to do the right thing.Michael Garfield:    To draw back to a talk that you gave at UBS last year, this links again to the Information Theory of Individuality paper, you know? This notion that the stable, predictable environment of the flow of nutrients allows for the rare cases in evolution where an animal might lose its head, where sea squirts and clams and so on, are capable of just fixing themselves to a rock and hanging out there and filtering. But the process of evolution, as we discussed with Brian Arthur on this show back in episode 13, that when you run evolutionary simulations, where you iterate game theoretical situations like the prisoner's dilemma over and over, thousands and thousands of times, you see what looks kind of analogous to an evolutionary trend to grow a head, to grow this kind of mechanism, this regulatory coordination. And so when we think about this in light of Geoff West’s and Chris Kempes’s comments on cities, COVID might be bringing us to a turning point where cities are seen as self-organizing, kind of headless, processes. We're seeing a kind of a historical shift towards more balance between the emergent bottom-up and the regulatory top-down that aligns the incentives of all of the various actors in the emergence of or the steering of a city.David Krakauer:    I think it's a very interesting point, and this is in some sense the Holy Grail of thinking about decentralized architectures. So, there's a lot of ideology here and we talked about it in relation to federalism and anti-federalism. It's talked about a lot in terms of collectivism versus liberalism or you know, libertarianism, and so forth. And what I think complex systems shows us is that these categorical distinctions are bogus. That each of these kinds of solutions evolves out of circumstance, and I think you're absolutely right. Mechanism design is not the reverse game theory in the sense of being totalitarian game theory. It's the right kind of game theory when the market mechanics don't work. There are a list of reasons for when that doesn't work, and we can go into them, they're the basis of economics 101 class, but it's a very natural evolutionary adaptation of the economy when a certain kind of information is not present. I think having a sophisticated take of all the strategies available to us to achieve desirable outcomes is important.We talked about that in relation to genetic regulatory architectures, and how different species according to the complexity of their genome assume the more autocratic versus more democratic topologies. Exactly the same applies here, and I think what we should all be understanding increasingly is that there isn't one best way to do things. The circumstances tell us which of the strategies we should be pursuing.Michael Garfield:    Yeah. So we've got one more piece here, Pamela Yeh’s and Ian MacGregor-Fors’s piece on animals in cities. And it seems like the question that they're gesturing toward in this piece is whether it's possible for us to apply this kind of reasoning to create mechanisms by which we can grow or adjust the way that we live in cities to align the incentives of humans and non-humans.David Krakauer:    Yeah, I liked this a lot. It reminded me of, I don't even remember the film, Logan's run. Have you ever seen that film? It was directed by Michael Anderson and Michael York and Jennifer Agutter and Peter Ustinov, and that was a film where –– I don't know when it set, sometime in the far distant future where human civilization lives in these geodesic domes, you talked about Buckminster Fuller –– and we're all placed in these small populations run by these horrible computer systems that take care of our lives, including when we get to reproduce. And so, to reduce overpopulation by the age of 30 we're all exterminated in this horribly weird ritual. And the reason I mentioned it is because at the end the characters that are played by Michael York and Jenny Agutter escape outside of their geodesic dome, and find themselves in a Washington of the future, and it's all overgrown with beautiful, lush vegetation and firms and so forth.  It's the world that was reclaimed by nature when humans abandoned it, presumably for some folly that that goes on specified. And in 2008, Alan Weisman wrote a beautiful book called The World Without Us, which was a catalog of events like that where for one reason or another buildings, various edifices, cities had been abandoned, and how long it takes for nature to reclaim its world. In that book, in fact, he interviews our colleague Doug Erwin, who contributed one of these transmissions. And so, what Pam and Ian do is report on that real world without us during the COVID crisis, and I think they're making two points. One is, what is going on really? And the second question is what kind of science can we do? What's going on that we should be recording during this natural experiment.We've all seen, you know, mountain goats in the streets of Wales, and Buffalo walking along highways in Delhi ,and dolphins frolicking in the Bosporus. It was all of this wonderful natural history going on now in urban settings. But there have been longterm evolution experiments, and they cite the particular example of the Galapagos tortoise. This is an animal that's evolved on an Island because of its size, it's essentially free of predators. And Darwin, when he was there in the 1830s says, you know, I met an immense Turpin that took little notice of me. They just don't care. They're sort of indifferent to humans. Pam and Ian and point out that there is research showing that in these very insular ecosystems, you have far tamer animals. That looks like a real effect, and you can ask, how long would it take for that to happen in our world?There is some work that they cite from 2010 where researchers from Spain looked across six different Galapagos species that have been reported to be somewhat indifferent to humans showing that now, about half of them respond with fear to human tourists. So, it didn't take very long for them to evolve an appropriate fear response. So that's the first part, how long does evolution take? The second part is, is their own work really. And they've been studying dark-eyed juncos: songbirds in Southern California. These are birds prior to the shutdown, had been moving down from the mountains into the cities and are actually quite well adapted to human presence, and have exploited our profligacy very efficiently. I think what they're asking now is what will happen to that species now that humans are no longer there? Will they become more like the Galapagos tortoise, even less concerned about human presence? That could actually be a problem when we come back into the environment and assert our ecological dominance.So I think the questions they're asking are very deep and very interesting. It's also worth pointing out that there have been negative impacts on animals by people staying indoors. There are many species that have, for good or ill, become dependent on us. I remember reading an article about a macaque species outside of Bangkok that had been fed by humans around monasteries, but now the food has run dry because the humans are no longer out in the world and they're engaging in these huge conflicts over scarcity of resources. That's a frightening fact, too. It's worth bearing in mind the negative consequences of humans retreating. And the larger picture, to your point Michael, is that what the pandemic is teaching us among many, many other things is that we share the planet, and we share it not only with viruses, but numerous other species. And those species are sensitive to our behavior. So, you know, when we return to the world, we kind of mentally also want to return to the wild. And it's an opportunity for us as a culture to evolve. I found that a very uplifting insight into what's going on today.Michael Garfield:    Yeah, you know Andy Dobson has spoken both on the show and elsewhere about the rate at which habitat destruction has increased, the frequency of zoonotic diseases, that more and more of these diseases like COVID-19 are emerging from the wilderness that we have unsettled by settling. And I think about Geoff West's piece on cities as disease incubators, and a piece of the conversation I had with Jennifer Dunn back when she was on the show in episodes five and six, about how the disruption to biodiversity is complex with cities. That empirical work that's been done over the last few years suggest that certain regions of cities actually promote different kinds of biodiversity. There's a change in the philosophy of conservation that is less about a sort of retro romantic restoration of lost biodiversity, but an active cultivation of an ongoing and open process. So, it gets us back again to this looking at the city as a multidimensional and wild process. I liked your turn, that as animals returned to these urban spaces, there's a kind of counterflow which is the rewilding of the human imagination, and the understanding through complex systems science that the city is itself a phenomenon of nature and so how can we design them to minimize the ecological disturbance and, counter-intuitively, to improve their capacity for epidemic proofing?David Krakauer:    Yeah, I always thought that the great existential crisis of modernity accelerated by isolation is loneliness, to feel alone in the world. And what the theory of evolution did for me was connect me to the rest of the world, right? Trees and my cousins. Insects and my cousins. There's a sense of true connectedness that comes from understanding our common evolutionary histories and now we're living in this time where we're fearful of a virus, and one would hope that the resolution of this kind of dialectical standoff would be a greater appreciation of our wild nature and our susceptibility to that world. That we're not isolated from it, we never have been. In learning about the microbiome, we realized that we were dominated by the genetics of a bacterium, that we're a tiny fraction of who we really think we are in terms of our individuality. And so, it would be nice to imagine a world where we can rethink our relation to the natural world.Michael Garfield:    Indeed. On that note, we're going to move this particular series of the show to biweekly, and we're going to take a week and let the city streets remain empty and the soil fallow on this podcast while we prepare for a series of interviews with our Miller Scholars, and return to our sort of regular programming. But this is a great time for those of you listening who have been inspired by these ideas. Complexity Explorer is about to reopen the Origins of Life course on May 18th. If you're sitting at home and looking for a way to stay stimulated and to continue learning, then that's a free course at Origins.ComplexityExplorer.org. Anything else before we sign off for this week, David?David Krakauer:   Well, thank you all for listening and we will continue with an a slightly different schedule. We thought it would be worth now reflecting on what we've learned and thinking about moving into the future, how our ideas should change. And so that the tone will be slightly different, hopefully more optimistic, but also with a view towards this new, wiser world that we hope to be occupying. So thank you, Michael. Thank you all.Michael Garfield:   Thank you. Take care everyone.
32,Episode Details / Transcript Michael Garfield: Tim Koehler, Marten Scheffer, welcome to Complexity Podcast.Tim Kohler: Thanks for having us.Martin Scheffer: Thanks. Happy to be here.Michael Garfield: I would like to discuss one particular paper, your paper on the future of the human climate niche that you coauthored with Chi Xu, Timothy Lenton, Jens-Christian Svenning, but there's a number of other papers that either or both of you have worked on over the years that I think linked to this one really well. So, we will be dipping into different areas of both of your research careers and we'll try and sort of constellate things and expand on some of the issues that you raise in this latest piece.Tim Kohler: Sounds great.Marten Scheffer: Sure.Michael Garfield: Excellent. Well, I'd like to start first by asking the two of you how this particular paper came to be. My understanding is that it had at least some of its origin story in an SFI working group.Marten Scheffer: Well, it's a long story. It started when I was at the conference of tropical ecology in Mérida in Mexico, and it was awfully hot and humid and I started wondering, is this good for humans? I started looking for literature, but I couldn't find any really good stuff, and then I forgot about it. Then later, working with Chu Xi, I thought, let's go back to the work we did on tropical rain forests, where we were characterizing the climate niche of the rainforest, and we did the same for Boreal ecosystems. So, let's try it for humans. I didn't think much of it, but a very clear pattern came out and it turned out that humans were concentrated very much in a particular temperature zone. And then we started wondering whether it was a coincidence perhaps, and thought, well, let's go back in time. But we didn't know how to go back in time. So that's when we called Tim Kohler. And since it had to do with climate, and we didn't know anything about climate, we needed Tim Lenton. And since we didn't know anything actually about where humans live, and for what reasons, we had to call on Jens-Christian Svenning.So, then we had a really a great team and we worked for a few years on this. At some point we thought it was a great idea to have a workshop about it at SFI, but by the time that we finally made it to SFI, the work had basically been done and we moved onto the next topic which we’ll produce by pursuing it, and which was fantastic, also. The title of that paper, so far, is Survival of the Systems. That that's how it goes in science, right? You have ideas and then they finally you come together but then you're already onto the next idea.Tim Kohler: So, in the end, there will probably be on the order of three, maybe four papers coming out of this working group. I think SFI will be quite pleased with the performance of this working group. By the time we got to Santa Fe, I think, I feel like our main job with respect to the paper we're discussing today was to see if we could poke some holes in it. Are there problems with this? What could possibly be wrong? We were, we were there primarily as critics, but also to see whether or not we could extend it meaningfully in other directions. We wanted to basically push and pull on it, and see where we went. And one of the things that came out of that was working with some new results from crowdsourced archeological research called ArcheoGLOBE, which coincidentally was published shortly after our working group. So, we could draw on their results to make estimates of how dense people had been in various portions of the world over chunks of time, going back to the beginning of the Holocene, that's to say 10 12,000 years ago. So, we drew on those results, as well as from results from more traditional land use patterns that have been attempted to extend back into prehistory, called the HYDE database. And we saw somewhat similar results from both of those, much to my surprise.They showed that in fact our preference for this relatively narrow temperature band between roughly 11 degrees centigrade and 15 degrees centigrade has been constant, well back into at least the mid Holocene, when a lot of the world's populations were still hunters and gatherers. 6,000 years ago, agriculture was just spreading across Europe, and just beginning to spread up from Mexico. So, by far the majority of the people in the world at that point were foragers, farmers, fishers, hunters and gatherers. They could be highly mobile, they can move wherever they want, and yet they stayed within that climate ban. Much to my surprise!Michael Garfield: Let's talk about that climate band as defined by this paper. The way that this particular piece has been reported, it succumbs to some of the kind of a perennial problem: I think science journalism doesn't really get under the hood, and look at how you came to the understanding that you came to. So, I'd love to hear how you went about defining this climate niche in the first place.Marten Scheffer: So, the way we looked at this was just by looking at population density, distribution of humans, not in space, but in climate space. You can make one axis which is, for instance, a mean annual temperature and the other axis, which is mean annual precipitation, and you can think of more axes and then you look in that space. What kind of combinations are available on the globe? How many places have those particular combinations? And then you look at where the people are, and from that you derive a preference. That's basically ecology, right? And we took the big step to say, as ecologists, well maybe humans are just another species, and let's see if they have some preferences, too. We didn't think that would lead to much because we know people are living everywhere. They live on the poles, and they live in the desert. But to our surprise, the distribution of people in the climate space was not at all random, there are very clear preferences. And with Tim Kohler's expertise, we took a look back in time, and what’s really surprising to see that we still have the same apparent preferences that we had 6,000 years ago. There must be something to that, we thought because we can move everywhere. We have all kinds of innovations, and still we have those same preference. So, that’s what got us on that track, that was the basic method. Of course, there is a lot of work and a lot of details to it because if you go back in time, and you want to reconstruct where humans were back in time, that's not so easy.And also, you have to project that on how the climate was in those places where the people were back in time. You really need this combination of expertise in paleo climate, in archeology. And that’s what we could do with this group.Michael Garfield: I thought it was interesting to note, you make a point in this paper that it's not that human beings are concentrating in the areas of greatest soil fertility.Marten Scheffer: Yeah, well of course you start looking for other things that are obvious. Where are the best soils? Where is enough rain? Where is the primary productivity, actually? We’re a large world. Where do the plants grow best, which is the basis for agriculture? None of those seem to be definite answers, but what's actually quite surprising is that temperature appeared so important. We were also limited in terms of rainfall; when there is no rain in the desert, there is no people. The temperature was perhaps the most surprising, and also one of the clearest patterns.Tim Kohler:  For me, one of the most interesting figures in the paper is the first figure. That figure shows that if you just look at the distribution of the available land surfaces in the world with respect to mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, it's spread out over a vast climate space. But then when you look at where people are now or where people were 6,000 years ago, we occupy a very narrow portion of that available niche. And, when you look at our distribution, you also see that it's quite similar to the present distribution of crop production, the present distribution of livestock production, and the present distribution of GDP. But, it's very dissimilar to the distribution of soil fertility, or net primary productivity. So, our crops in our livestock are selected for a specific band within the available niche, within the available soil fertility, and net primary productivity. So, it's worrisome to think about the future and where our crop production and livestock production will go, as that climate niche begins to move on the surface of the earth.Michael Garfield: That brings us to the meat of this paper, which is the ominous forecast that the next 50 years of climate change are going to result in a pretty significant redistribution of this niche across the surface of the planet. What models did you use in order to investigate this?Marten Scheffer:  We just followed the standard climate models. We didn't compute the climate in the future, which is used to IPCC models. We looked at different scenarios of various degrees of warming, and found that for each degree of warming you can roughly say that about a billion people get into serious problems, about a billion people need to move from this same climate niche that served us well for the past 6,000 years. So that’s the analysis of the niche. And it became such big numbers: for three degrees you’ve got 3 billion people in serious trouble. We also wanted to look at a very different, very simple approach, and just look at the hottest places that we can find now on earth, which have a mean annual temperature of above 29 degrees centigrade. We looked at how large the geographical area will be where those temperatures will be felt in the future, and for a three degree warming, you see that covers an area where about 3 billion people would live, and it’s very hard to live at that temperature.Tim Kohler: So those temperatures on the globe today are mostly restricted to the central Sahara in Africa. But this paper shows that, under the “business as usual” or also sometimes called the” worst case scenario,” those temperatures are going to expand greatly in central Africa, but also extend over onto the Arabian Peninsula, portions of Southern Asia, portions of Northern Australia, and a large portion of Amazonia in Northern South America. So those places are going to be very hard hit under the “business as usual” or “worst case scenario,” which we certainly hope we can avoid.Michael Garfield: Looking at figure four in this paper that shows the current suitability to the human niche and then the projected 2070 suitability and the difference between them, just at a glance it doesn't look like we've lost much terrain in a temperature sense, right? But I understand that if anything, maybe by temperature, more of the earth is actually suitable, but it's not just that one dimensional analysis. And you do go into some detail in this about why this particular projection is likely to be so difficult, and it has to do with the distribution of the projected population growth, and the difficulties of migration. It's not as simple as just saying, well, Hey, there's a bunch of new land up there for you in Canada and Siberia, and why don't you just move three and a half billion people up there? So, I'd love to hear you get into more of the multidimensional complexity of this situation and how it's not as simple as just saying, well, Hey, there's going to be a ton of new arable land.Marten Scheffer: Well, yeah, the point you make is very good, of course. Some places become worse and other places on the globe become better. So, what's the problem? We just have to move. Well, that's not so easy. People have always moved in the past in response to climatic change. It's strange that we never want to talk about it. When we think about climate change, we stress two things we should do: we should limit it, and we should adapt locally to the new climate. I think our paper suggests that there may be a third thing that we should do, and that is prepare ourselves for organized migration. Think about the best way for some redistribution. Looking at the data that we get, it's hard to imagine accommodating different degrees of climate change without at least relocating hundreds of millions of people, at least. And that's a kind of a taboo, no-go area of discussion. I think with our results, it becomes clear that we should start thinking about the best way to do that. Migration can bring lots of good things. People don't like to go away, they don’t go away unless it's really needed, but also know of many good things that have come from migration. But it can also cause tremendous stress and conflict. So how do we prepare ourselves for that? How we deal with that globally will make a lot of difference.Tim Kohler: Yeah, and I might point out that even within countries we can see that there might be some demand for relocation. If you look just at North America, you can see that the Southern portions of the United States, on that figure four, look as though they are going to become extremely uncomfortable under “the business as usual scenario” in 50 years. Whereas the Northern portions extending on into Southern Canada look like they're going to be increasingly attractive. So, the stresses and strains of migration are probably easier to manage within nations. Between nations, they get much more difficult, but we know that even within United States, movement of people from place to place has been stressful and politically unpalatable at times. We have the example of the dust bowl, in which large portions of many people in the Southern Plains left for places like California where they were exploited rather viciously by large group growers and other people. You can read Grapes of Wrath and find out the story on the ground. I'd have to say that looking at figure four, this is probably the first paper I've ever published in my life where I'm hoping that we will be wrong, that the future will prove us wrong. We always want our science to be correct, and we hope that the models the projections are correct, but we also hope that the future is not what we're predicting in this, which is the “worst case scenario.” We're hoping that indeed there can be adaptation and mitigation that will make things less dire than they appear to be in these maps.Michael Garfield: No doubt. But you introduce a fold into this paper, which is the unwillingness of people to move, that typically migration is avoided for as long as possible. And that's where I'd love to link in this other piece that the two of you coauthored with Marco Gunston for Current Anthropology back in 2003: “Sunk Cost Effects and Vulnerability to Collapse in Ancient Societies,” because it feels like this piece speaks directly to the psychological dynamics involved when it comes to getting people to leave their homes and their communities under even extraordinary strain. Would you care to unpack the thinking behind this particular paper?Tim Kohler: Let me start on that because that used a portion of one of the areas I work in as a test scenario. The larger concept has to do with sunk costs. The idea that people weigh future actions taking into account their past investment, which is a completely irrational, non-rational thing to do. In fact, people should take into account the future circumstances and their projections of the future, not how much they have invested in a particular landscape. But this sunk cost effect means that people are less likely to move, the more they have invested in a particular area. The area we were looking at was a particular area that was investigated by the Dolores Archeological Project in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and this area was inhabited very densely by Puebloan populations from about 8,700 to 900, and towards the end of that period, climates turn quite unfavorable for agriculture, and these people were heavily reliant on maize agriculture. So, they began to leave this area.But what we found is that in those places where there was the greatest investment in structures, in fields and infrastructure in general, people stayed the longest. They were the most reluctant to leave. And this points out that people leave places for essentially two different reasons. First of all, they do make some rational calculation. Are we able to make a living here? But secondly, they're highly conformist in their decisions. When people finally decide to leave, many more people leave than probably would have had to, based on the rational calculation. But at the beginning of a migration process, there is a much less migration then you would expect. So, there are thresholds here for migration, and they're very nonlinear. That will lead perhaps to very interesting dynamics as we move into the future and see what happens with some of these areas on our map that are red. Will people leave as they begin to turn red? Probably not, they will probably stay as long as they can, which might mean a massive and more uncontrolled and more unplanned migration, if don't begin to do something about the conditions that are provoking the migration in the first place.Marten Scheffer: You could also look at the same phenomena from a very different angle. The idea that we have sunk cost phenomena means that we don't want to change doing things. This is also true for ways of living for things you believe, for your investment in your belief, your way of living. We know we should change the way we live to control climate change and biodiversity loss, but it's very hard to do that. And so that's another face of the same problem. It seems very difficult to change. It’s very interesting now to see in COVID crisis time, that actually some things that we thought were completely unthinkable suddenly happened. So, yes, we can, we can make all kinds of changes, but we are very reluctant to change our way of living, to abandon some things even if we know rationally that that would be best.Michael Garfield:  I think the two of you hit the two sides of this idea that I wanted to touch, that this particular paper mentions. It says the model predicts that sunk cost effects can lead to growth of settlements to a point where they are about to overexploit the resources, and at this point resilience, the basin of attraction, becomes very small and adverse stochastic effects will tend to induce collapse. You know, for the last several weeks in the Transmission Series that I've been hosting with David Krakauer, this has been coming up time and time again. I'm glad to see in a way that the pandemic has illuminated for people the ways that we have tuned our society to brittle-efficiency. And yet, like you said, the more we benefit from economies of scale in time supply chains, and so on, these features of our global economy as it has been, the more likely it looks like we are making ourselves vulnerable to what for many people would be a surprise shock, like the pandemic. Even though there's lots of, “I told you so,” going on right now.But that also, like you mentioned to us now, it makes us somewhat more likely at a crisis of collective decision making, to continue with business as usual because it is harder without the crisis to climb down, off of the local optimum on your evolutionary fitness landscape. I think that's sort of the beauty of this paper, how it explains why, en masse, it's so difficult for us to do what we understand to be the right thing, but to make that decision as individuals. And so that brings me to … speaking of collective action problems, Marten and you were coauthor of a piece in Science Magazine back in 2016 on social norms as solutions. And I feel like there is sort of a ray of hope here. I mean, there are 26 authors on this article, which presents its own collective action problem. Could you talk a little bit about this ‘policies and large-scale behavioral tipping points’?Marten Scheffer: Well, you mentioned the number of authors on this. This is a dynamic organized by the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics, and it brings together a bunch off ecologists and economists and various social scientists to spend a long weekend in an isolated Island in the Baltic. Much as people get together at the isolated Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, but then we were in the Baltic. There is nothing there. We have to cook our own stuff and so it's a long boat trip and then we just talk and talk about something that we find interesting, and each year a paper comes out of that.And this time we were interested in this question, and the paper originally was called The Non-Smoking Planet. We were interested in the question, why do social norms change, sometimes? Why do we suddenly have no smoking in public places across Europe? It's sacked in someplace, and then it's everywhere. Why do those kinds of transitions happen, and why do they not happen very often, and what is needed for them to happen? So, we looked through all kinds of cases and worked from examples rather than theory. When did we see a transition to no littering, or the transition in ancient China that ended the foot binding of little children? Why did it not happen for a long time, and why did it suddenly happen?And the conclusion of that paper, looking across all of those cases, is that people stay with a particular way of doing things, but the resilience of that thing becomes less and less, the resilience of the idea that we can all smoke in public places is reduced, because we start understanding how unhealthy it is. You hear more and more stories, and then you get desperate because when you want to make a policy, you realize that nothing is changing. It looks like nothing is changing, but really something is changing in the background, it's the resilience of the old way of doing things. And when time is ready, then you can have a rapid cascading change. In the beginning maybe, you need to police it a bit, make sure that people don't start smoking in a public place, but very soon you don't have to do that. Now if I light a cigarette in a school or in university, everybody looks angry at me, so I immediately put it out. It has become a social norm. Of course, when we think of sustainability of the planet there are many things that many people realize we need to change. We should change this or that. We should, and not much is happening. Things are happening in small groups, people become vegan and you get more and more people becoming vegan, but it's not spreading across the whole globe, and it looks like nothing is happening. But things are happening, and at some point, the resilience of the ‘status quo’ will be diminished, and the good news is that then big things can happen pretty rapidly.Michael Garfield: One of the points in this paper is about the visibility of a new behavior, and how much more difficult it is to change something if people cannot observe their neighbors making the change. There is mention here about customers of a major electric utility who were much more likely to participate in a program preventing blackouts when their neighbors could tell who signed up.Marten Sheffer: Yeah, sure. There are a lot of things we know from social psychology and I remember talking to Lynn Ostrom before she passed away about this, and it's a point she would, she would emphasize that visibility of your behavior is very important. It just makes it easier to change some things than other things. Smoking in public places is very visible, but you can, you can do something about visibility. You can make the behavior of people in some sense more visible. Like in that example.Michael Garfield: This seems like a particularly sticky issue when we're talking about long-term climate modeling because people tend to get lost in the weeds as I know you both know, about the details of the model. In earlier episodes when I had a Mirta Galesic on, she was talking about the calculation that each of us are kind of unconsciously running at all times about social truth versus factual truth, and, like you said, the importance of conformity and how –– when there are not imminent negative consequences to holding a counterfactual belief or behaving as if you do –– then people will choose the politically motivated bias over an adherence to empirical reality. So, I'm curious how the two of you see opportunities for this kind of behavioral tipping point. This far out, when we're talking about 2070 –– and all of this is for so many people very vivid and real, you know? If you're living in one of these zones where they have these extreme heat waves, or hurricanes have gone up by many factors over the last couple of decades...but for a lot of people, it's not as obvious. I'm curious how you imagine we might be able to bring this down to earth for people, without running them over the cliff.Tim Kohler: You raise a really interesting point, and in archeology we phrase this as the “low frequency versus high frequency change” problem. The increasing mean annual temperature of the earth surface is a very low frequency problem. It's virtually impossible for an individual to sense those very small increases in temperature, even over the course of a relatively long lifespan. But what is salient to people are the severe events, the extreme events that get superimposed on tops of these things. So, you've got a low frequency process moving along, in this case, it's mostly ramping up, then you've got high frequency processes superimposed on that and they're tracking the low frequency process to some extent. But of course, the highs get higher as you move to track that low frequency process. So, the extreme events are going to get more extreme and those are really what people will be keying in on: the heat waves, which have been getting progressively worse in Europe over the last decade or so, he severe storms, droughts, all those things do capture people's attention. They are highly visible, and it's becoming more plausible now than it was just a few years ago to assess the extent to which climate change is responsible for those. This is the attribution problem, that one can take climate models with and without forcing by warming from greenhouse gases, and assess how likely it is, how likely it would have been to have had such a storm or some other extreme event without global warming, and thereby provide an estimate of the extent to which those extreme events can be attributed to climate change. So, this is very powerful, because these are highly visible. People feel them. They're aware of them, unlike the increases in mean annual temperature,Marten Scheffer: This is a big, big topic that we can can talk a lot about: what is needed to change the behavior of people? But you're entering a big area there: it's not just individual decisions. Of course, policy makes a lot of difference. So, what happens in the world is also to a large extent determined by big firms. There is a limited number of firms that basically run the world. You could say we have democracies, but democracies work in ways that do not simply reflect individual preferences, and then there is the other big issue which is the way that our perception of the world has changed, as a result. For instance, we could explore social media use in many areas, it's a wide-open field.Michael Garfield: I don't want to leave you on the side Marten, but there's an opportunity here to talk, Tim, about your new paper. This piece on this Seshat DataBank. What I'd like to do first is address in the paper on the future of the climate niche, the alternative to migration which is adaptation, and then return to collective decision making and the scale of human society, and our ability to integrate at that scale in the new piece on Seshat. As you make clear in this paper, it's not just migration. You leave a wide-open area to speculate about possible adaptations that we're able to make in the next 50 years. I have to suffer the Twitter responses to this kind of stuff as part of my job, and somebody pointed out on Twitter that people living in Phoenix and Miami are already living in these kinds of conditions, and they seem to be doing okay. But of course, they're also dependent on agricultural supply from other areas. And so, it's a very complex image. So, I'm curious just to hear your thoughts on the possibility of adapting to this, and what particular challenges you think we would face in doing so.Tim Kohler:  Well, this is something that, of course the IPCC worries a lot about. One of the great interests of the IPCC is what kind of adaptation can be done to these sorts of changes? How can we face these? How can we do better? And obviously, one can breed crops to attempt to make them productive under higher temperature conditions or different precipitation conditions. One can breed animals in the same way. But it's also believed, and I'm sure this is correct, that there are limits to adaptability. There are limits to plasticity for these various plants and animals. We don't necessarily know, at least I don't know, where those limits lie exactly, but it's highly plausible in my view that not all of this problem can be met just by adaptation. IPCC uses another term which is “mitigation” in a rather special way, and what ITCC means by mitigation is the prevention of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere in the first place, or perhaps the removal of them from the atmosphere after they've gotten there.And so one hopes that through adaptation and mitigation, a great deal of the demand that would otherwise be met by migration can be met, but one doesn't know exactly how much and what that will look like because we're looking into the future and we're trying to assume that a technology will always be able to help us out of our difficulties. But one of the things that I think that I know as an archeologist is that many past societies have gotten into trouble that their technology was unable to get them out of. We don't really know whether or not our technology will be able to help us out of the hole we're digging ourselves into. We can certainly hope that that's the case, but I wouldn't want to pin our futures just on that hope personally.Marten Scheffer: So, you're mentioning people saying while people live in Phoenix and in Las Vegas and they do pretty well. Actually Las Vegas doesn't have such a high mean annual temperature, and neither does Phoenix. We're talking about ultra-places. You can live anywhere, of course if you have the means, if you have a well isolated house, powerful air conditioning, when you fly in your food, there is no problem to live wherever, even in that great heat. But if you have to earn a living working on the land, working outside, doing labor, then that is just not a possibility. So, people tend to have a strange perspective on heat. They think that Las Vegas is a hot place. While it can be much hotter than that. And they seem to think “what's the problem? I have air co, I have food,” but that that is not the situation that the vast majority of the people have that would be exposed to those very hot temperatures.Michael Garfield: That's a good point. You mentioned in this paper that something like 50% of today's global population are small holder farmers or depend on small holder farming, and this is outdoor work. So, I guess at least one of those innovations would have to be like a dune stillsuit or something that you can…Marten Scheffer: Yeah, everything is possible, if you have to resources, everything is possible. But most people just don't have to resources.Tim Kohler:   Well, and the other trap is in thinking that we can always use technology to get ourselves out of these difficulties. And of course, air conditioning, at least the kinds we have available right now, flying in food, or other means of transporting food, all of these things take a lot of energy, and under present technology released a lot of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, ultimately making the problem even worse. So, when we use energy-intensive ways to try to get ourselves out of these problems through some kind of adaptation, in the long run, we're digging ourselves into a deeper hole.Michael Garfield:  Yeah, it's funny, the air conditioner is sort of a perfect example of this tragedy of the commons failure to coordinate. On that note, I didn't actually intend to discuss this paper today, but there is a fascinating paper that Tim just coauthored with Jaeweon Shin, Michael Price at SFI, David Wolpert at SFI, Hajime Shimao at SFI, Brendan Tracy, also. There's a lot of Santa Fe Institute on this one, but it's a paper about the Seshat DataBank that Peter Turchin and his people have put together, and a cut into it…a bit of exploration about the history of social evolution. And I'd like to hear you kind of lay out what you found in this study, and then let's turn it around and look at what light it might shed on this paper about the human climate niche moving forward.Tim Kohler: Well in the first place, our paper was stimulated by a very interesting paper that Peter Turchin and his group published about two years ago in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And in that, they mined the Seshat DataBank as it existed a couple of years ago to try to look at the processes that move societies from very small scale –– as in say early Neolithic societies thousands of years ago –– to the sorts of apparently more complex societies that we see in the early States of France or England, or the early States of Mesopotamia. Can we see whether there are shared processes involved? And so, they had something like 50 different variables that they thought might be involved in this process that they were monitoring in their data bank. They grouped those into nine characteristics that they call “Complexity Characteristics,” and they did a principal component analysis. And they showed that the first principal component, that is the shared variance, across all these societies as they moved from small to large, was extremely high. 77% of the variants were shared among all these different societies. And these differences included things like: the capital population grew, the territories of the polities grew, the total population of the parties grew, the writing systems became more complex, the systems in which economic transactions were monitored became more complex, and on and on across nine different characteristics, more levels in the government, and more levels in the religion, and things like that. So that was a fairly stunning result. And David and I and other members of his group decided we'd like to look at this more closely, so we did. What we found is that there's another pattern in, there in addition to that which Peter Turchin and his group saw, that in no way invalidates what they did.But the second principle component, in fact, shows that this apparently monolithic process of social, political evolution can be resolved into something like three different phases. In a first phase we see that polities or societies are concentrating on increasing in scale, mostly in population, but also in territory size. Once they get up to a particular scale, then they bump up against a boundary in which they cannot easily grow more in scale until they have improved their ways of processing information and processing economic transactions. And we call that a sort of information threshold. So, once they get up to the scale threshold, then they have to solve an information problem. And in the second phase of social evolution, there are multiple different pathways that societies explore for increasing their efficiency in their power and the information content of the ways in which they monitor transactions and govern and store information.Once those problems have been solved, they come into a third phase of social evolution, which is again, predominantly a growth in scale. And we see this primarily only in the old world and the formation of big empires in the old world. So, does this have any ramifications? Can we build any intuitions from any of this as to what might happen in the future? Well that wasn't the point of that paper, but one thing does come to mind right away, and that is that we have radically improved our capacities for information processing in the last two or three decades. We now have marvelous cyber infrastructure that allows us to store, monitor and mine vast amounts of information. Does this mean that we are on the threshold of another sort of revolution in terms of growth in scale? In fact, I think we're already there. We're already embarking on that, and I'd like to point to something Marten said just a moment ago, that that growth in scale seems at this point to have been largely in the domain of private companies. Commercial firms, places like Google –– well you know the companies as well as I do –– those have really profited from literally from this growth in scale and they've become much more powerful actors on the world scene than any previous corporation has ever been. And where that will take us is an interesting question.Michael Garfield: You know, I wonder if there's a different way to read this and you're the one to ask living online as I must for this job, it seems like so much of the conversation that I encounter is about polarization, fragmentation, the disintegration of the social graph. I talked about this with David and one of the transmission episodes regarding research by Miguel Fuentes, what we see at the cusp of a crisis, you know, that we see people Balkanize and seek out local solutions. And I'm curious in your study of archeological history, there was always another society over there, and now the story of global civilization is about changes happening within this planet, spanning structure or process. And so, when we talk about there being collective action problems, we pride ourselves on having gone through this information explosion. But the success of companies like Google hinge on their ability to help us sift and navigate and organize and make sense of all of that information. And I wonder if one of the things required in order to adapt, mitigate and migrate in a non-tragic way, in response to changes in global climate, might be better ways to coordinate ourselves as a planetary entity. And you know, we don't have a lot to go on as far as precedence in that regard.Tim Kohler: What you're saying is that the cyber infrastructure has been built and is, at least to some extent, controlled, and made available to us by these huge multinational corporations, may allow us some opportunities, working largely from the bottom up, to coordinate our actions a little bit better. That's a very hopeful view of what could happen. One could also imagine that these companies or other powerful actors will find ways to influence the information that is available in these networks in such a way that people do not have full access to the information that they really ought to have despite the enormous reach of these media.Michael Garfield: If we're going to dip back into the discussion of sunk costs to ask the economic equation that each of us has individually, and all of us collectively, are making as we pivot through the space of possible futures here…other than a massive uptick in extreme weather events, what sort of you catastrophes, to borrow a term from JRR Tolkien, do you imagine might lead to a more intelligent and preemptive response? What changes do you think might be possible here, Marten? I know that this paper on policy and large-scale behavioral tipping points touches on some of this, you know, the possibility of making a tipping point where none previously existed. Where do you think it's worth steering the inquiry –– not just through Google asks-->filter-->bubble manipulation of people's information as you just suggested, Tim –– but what might make this an easier calculation for people? One thought might be like Jessika Trancik’s work on the declining cost of batteries and electric vehicles. What else did the two of you see as bumping us off the “business as usual” trajectory into climate disaster?Marten Scheffer: Well, that's a good question. If you want to change the world, change has to happen on many levels, simultaneously. So that same group that is brought together each year into Baltic by the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics is actually working now on a paper on this question, and the consensus in the end is that we get to is there is no silver bullet thing.  What we will need is, first of all, this underlying increasing awareness that is destabilizing the status quo. People need to become more and more aware that we need to do things differently. But then also it has to happen. So that there can be those social norm tipping points, but it also has to translate to other levels. So, one level that is of interest is the level of the multinational organizations, whether they are point interested in making a move at some point, and what is needed for them to do that. What kind of things from national policies are needed to do that? What kind of pressure from consumers is needed to do that?Then there is the view that bouncing back and forth little Twitter messages and Facebook connections doesn't get us to the depth of the discussion that we need. So maybe we need to have a more space for this elaboration. Maybe we need to get together for deeper discussion. And there are thoughts about how it is that kind thing can be organized. In general, you can think of different levels of levers on systems. The easiest ones are, well, let's just increase the minimum wage or just changing small parameters. The most profound one is changing the intent of the system. Where does it want to go? For instance, if you look now in Chile, there is a lot of social change going on. It was before the COVID crisis, I don't know if you noticed, but there were street protests, very big protests, millions in the streets. It was the whole country was flat. In fact, it was a bit like the Yellow Vests in Paris that people were just unhappy with the way things were going. It was mainly about inequality. It was triggered by the fact that people couldn't pay their electricity bills, their water bills, everything is privatized. Electricity, water is privatized, and they saw the people in charge of those companies leading very rich lives and they saw their retired parents being unable to pay the bills, so people became very angry. But then it changed in a very interesting direction. People started asking, okay, what kind of country do we want to live in? There were meetings in all the town halls, spontaneous meetings that everyone could set up, asking what kind of country do we want to live in?The end of the story is that the constitution is going to be rewritten, and that's an anchor for a lot of change. It's not easy for a country to get a constitution rewritten, but you have to think about all those levels. The constitution was there because of the military dictature had changed the constitution in a way that would ensure continued power for the people that took the power. So, it's not like you can change something here and we will resolve everything. We have to change things, we have to think about change on different levels, and we have to find a synergy between those, if we want to speed up change…the change that is needed. There is not an easy action, not an easy silver bullet thing, but it all starts with a realization that we all are much better off if we force a change.  And then we pressure Milton nationals, we pressure governments, we change our constitution, we change our behavior. That kind of broad sweeping change is needed. And I think things like our paper may help people realize that something big is coming, and we need to change big if we want to avoid that.And it happens to come in a time of the COVID crisis, where people are suddenly changing all kinds of things at very high economic costs across the whole world. I think we are seeing that yes, that is possible. It's not that we are inevitably locked into the way we always did things. It's very clear now that that is not the case. We can change. We can change rapidly and profoundly, even if that has a short-term economic cost.Tim Kohler: That's a good place to stop, in my opinion. It was very nicely said.Michael Garfield: So be it, yeah. I really want to thank the both of you for taking the time to talk today.
33,Episode Details / Transcript Michael Garfield: All right, David, we are back for the seventh in this mini-series about the pandemic. And I feel like this one is also kind of timed very well for the crisis in a legitimacy and inequality and justice that we're seeing around the world right now, because this week we get to talk about the obvious realities that are really only obvious in retrospect that have been hidden in plain sight and, and what it means to bring those things into visibility. So, where do you want to dive into this?David Krakauer: Yeah, I do. We have to remark on the current moment and just that we are living in a very complex world, and it's more important than ever for us to face up to, as you say, the reality that has been in plain sight, but we have treated as if it were hidden. And I think that, to the best of our ability in our work, we try and address these issues. Actually, as you know, I edited a book of essays called Hidden in Plain Sight, and I was very inspired in that title by a short story that many people will know by Edgar Allan Poe called the Purloined Letter. It's a very interesting short story, and the detective in that short story is the great Auguste Dupin. It's the absolute opposite of the standard mystery. The standard mystery is something like a Dan Brown mystery, where the secret is elaborately hidden, and it requires some kind of torturous ingenuity to so to solve.  But, what Poe did is he subverted the genre by saying, you know, the hardest crime, the one that's truly difficult to solve, is the crime that's right in front of your eyes. And of course, I'm not just editorializing by pointing out that in the, in the larger, more expansive sense, that's what society is dealing with now: the crime that has been there right in front of their eyes, but is extremely difficult to solve. And scientists love puzzles, you know, we like to solve the hidden mysteries. And we discover things like subatomic particles and devise ingenious machines to allow us to see them. But, I think today's discussions are going to be about the kinds of ideas necessary to see the forces that have been shaping both the biological and cultural world around us. I just wanted to make that introduction.So, the first contribution I guess, to discuss is the one that I wrote with Dan Rockmore, in this particular case.  We were just talking about this interesting analogy between how the forces that shape evolution have been hidden in the way that the forces that shaped the universe have been hidden. In the 1930s, an astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky pointed out that there is a discrepancy between the amount of gravitational force needed to account for the movements of the galaxies, in terms of the visible luminous matter, and the invisible matter that he called the dark matter. And this was confirmed much, much later by Vera Rubin and Kent Ford who used more detailed spectrographic data to show that in fact, most of the universe is made up of both dark matter that accounts for gravitation, and dark energy, that is the pressure that's moving everything apart. And so, we're living in this very strange world now where physics for all its extraordinary contributions, can only account for 5% of what we see.Dan and I got very interested in that and said, you know what we see in the living world, how much of what we see can be counted for by what is visible to the naked eye. And an interesting observation to make is that when Darwin wrote the origin of species in 1859, he had no idea that there was a microbial world. If you look through that book very carefully, you might be surprised to find not one mention of a bacterium, or certainly not one mentioned virus. And that's because they weren't discovered until several decades later. In fact, for most of our history, certainly not in the 19th century, but certainly in the 16th and 17th, people believe that small things like ants and flies were spontaneously generated. That they didn't need an explanation beyond the fact that they just sort of mutated into existence spontaneously.And it was in the 1880s that Koch and Beijerinck discovered bacteria, and then viruses. The point that we wanted to make in this contribution is that the evolution of complex life, multicellular life, the kind of life that Darwin described, is deeply entangled with the evolution of simple life. And that the evolution of scientific ideas is deeply entangled with the plundering of microbial innovations. And –– this is the interesting factor of the world –– that the complex world that we now recognize would not exist if it were not for viruses. I guess we'll go into that, but moreover, many of our technologies of molecular biology, of genetic engineering are essentially direct borrowing from innovations that viruses have come up with over hundreds of millions of years.Michael Garfield: Yeah. I've been talking about this for quite a while, the discovery of CRISPR by Jennifer Doudna and her lab, and how this is such a perfect example of…you have a list of biotechnologies that were found in this kind of way, but it draws attention to the way that so much of human innovation is just accidental or intentional biomimicry. And so, when we're talking about dark matter, there's something about how it links to this broader theme. We want to unpack in this conversation how the models that we make of the world are made at the timescale of the systems adapting to the world that they're modeling; which is the brain, which is the human lifespan, at the human scale, and the social environment that dominates our attention. So, it's dark matter when we're talking about cosmology, because 95% of the cosmos is irrelevant to the human timescale, to the human social world.  And, this points me toward humility, because evolution and the cosmos…evolution as a distributed intelligent process has made a lot of discoveries because it's operating at a different time scale. I guess what I'm saying is that we have this way…like IP Fest veteran Cory Doctorow talks about the ridiculousness of “Terra Nullius,” this idea that we invent things out of nothing, that we can take credit somehow for our inventions. When really so much has to be said about being in the right place at the right time, and having our search through the space of possible innovations directed by the agency of our landscapes, and the evolutionary pressures of our moment. This question comes up in the Facebook group a lot about whether emergence is an epistemological or ontological question. Does complexity really emerge, or do we just notice it? And, I think a lot of this conversation is about how, really, we're not inventing these things or creating them. In many cases, there's a good argument that we're simply discovering what was already there because the times call for it. And that’s a shot-call on Brian Enquist’s piece later in this conversation, but I'll pin it there.David Krakauer:  Yeah, I think that there are some very intriguing discussions to be had in the interstices of your remarks. I was very taken by Singer's Darwinian ethics. I've always believed that a deep familiarity with evolutionary thinking changes your ethical responsibilities in the living world, because we come to an understanding that we basically are primates –– we’re almost indistinguishable from chimpanzees and gorillas, and were very closely related to invertebrates and into the trees. And that awareness of the common origin of all living things should extend deeply our sympathies and empathy to the nonhuman world. I think your argument is correct. The same argument should apply to human ingenuity. And, you're right, I think CRISPR is a beautiful example. I make these kinds of remarks and people think I'm nuts, but I stick by them…I believe that if Doudna and others were to win the Nobel prize for CRISPR, they should share it with prokaryotes who invented it.  They just tinkered with a solution that the bacteria discovered. And I think that's really true. I think if people understood how much of our science –– certainly in the biological sciences –– is essentially a repurposing of discoveries made by evolution, that would change the way they think about creativity in this networked world, right?Human intelligence is a part of a larger ecological system and it shouldn't be separated from it. Let me just give some examples, because I think it's important that folks understand what we're talking about here. In this paper we go through the history of genetics itself; that genetics would not exist as a science if it wasn't for the endonuclease enzyme. And that came directly from the restriction enzyme system of bacteria, it is the basis of most cellular biology, and certainly molecular cloning. CRISPR, as you pointed out, is based on an immune system that bacteria have to deal with viruses that might turn out to be the most important source of gene therapy ever appropriated from the natural world. Our own immune system, the adaptive immune system that is helping us fight off this horrible COVID virus and other viruses is actually based on a system called the RAG system, which was essentially stolen from a virus, and placed in a human, and now as the basis of immunotherapy. You can go on and on and on, for example, modern cancer therapies where you target preferentially cancer cells are borrowing the cellular tropism of viruses, in order to deliver appropriate drugs. So, it's extraordinary the extent to which engineering ingenuity has relied on viruses, but then you actually have to think about life itself.Sex. There's a very interesting hypothesis that the late William Hamilton proposed, which is that the reason we have recombinational sex is to generate diversity to fend off pathogenic viruses. If it wasn't for the variability of the virus, we wouldn't have required a system to generate variability to counteract it, and so, we would be asexual. So, you know, even at the level of our own lives and the meaning we derive from our relationships, there's a deep evolutionary origin in our relationship to microbes.Michael Garfield:  I feel like there's a thread here that links us to the next piece by Jon Machta, which is about how –– as David Kinney talked about when he was on the show, about explanatory depth and the way that different disciplines of science seem to focus at different scales, it's because the requisite explanatory depth to explore the world at that scale comes with a certain metabolic cost: the cost of fine graining things, or course graining, and seeing them as big as is required, that there are differing computational loads and energetic investments required at all of these different scales. And it's been convenient, historically…I love that you used the word “appropriation” of the products of evolutionary search…because, again to call back to the piece on Terra Nullius and intellectual property, appropriation is easy when the systems that you're looking at have been conveniently reduced to featureless points. You can talk about a network, but if you're talking about a COVID transmission network, that transmission network is made out of people, and it's easy to forget if you're tuning things for convenience, for a parsimonious epidemic model, that there are other crucial dimensions involved in the way that that disease will spread. And, one is that the network is made out of people who are making economic decisions, that they have their own incentives. This has been a big piece of a huge amount of the work that's been going on at SFI with agent-based-modeling, and a huge piece of the kind of models that people like Lauren Ancel Meyers and Caroline Buckee have been doing. But Jon's got an interesting take on it, so why don't you unpack that?David Krakauer:    Yes, so Jon brings us back to that enigmatic hieroglyph, R0, this critical epidemic parameter that when greater than one tells us that an infection will grow exponentially, and when it's less than one, it will peter out. The technical terms for that are supercritical and subcritical. And what Jon asks, exactly as you said, is what dictates the value of what R0 is? Part of what dictates the value of the R0 is the transmissibility of the pathogen, so biological factors. And part of what dictates it are social, behavioral, and cultural factors, like social isolation and quarantine. So R0 captures both of these contributions, and what he goes on to point out is that the tension between these two contributions makes R0 hover around 1. I want to make this point more broadly, because it's such a key idea in complexity science, that it's worth investigating the history of this idea a little bit.So just consider water, think about the ocean. The average surface temperature of the ocean is about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and it boils at about 212 Fahrenheit. Now, the ocean isn't poised at the critical point, where water would vaporize. That would be a disaster, right? Because if there were a tiny fluctuation in the temperature, the oceans would vaporize, and that would be the end of it all. In complex systems, though, the opposite things happen. These critical points where you observe phase transitions –– like the R0 for an epidemic to it being contained –– are attractors that attractors of the dynamical system, that's naturally where the system wants to live at this extraordinary unstable point, which is very surprising. And there's data, by the way, from physiology, 20 years of data on the study of the brain, that shows that neurons are tuning themselves to near critical points, to a sort of order/disorder transition.In 1987, Per Bak, Chao Tang, and Kurt Wiesenfeld wrote a paper in Physics Review Letters, a very famous letter, where they introduce the idea of self-organized criticality, and this is the term we use to explain why a system would be driven to the critical point. So, John's explanation is the one that you described, which is that the biology of the pathogen wants R0 to be very large because the virus spreads very widely. Human society wants to drive that down. So what happens, as we approach R0 = 1 equals is, well, as R0 falls below one, all of the news agencies and all of the government agencies and the media say, look, R0 is below one, so we can now go out and socialize, and we can return to work, and restore the markets. But, as soon as we do that, the biology takes over, and it drives it above 1.And then, when it's driven above 1 culture takes over, and it drives it below 1. And it just oscillates back and forth around 1. And at that value –– take the contributions that say Cris Moore made, and Sid Redner made on long tails kick in –– because one of the characteristics of hovering by a critical point is that you get power law scaling of outbreaks. In fact, in the original paper of Per Bak and his colleagues, they looked at what's called the sand-pile model. That's what made this field famous. Imagine you have a level surface and you slowly pour sand onto it, it accumulates into a little sand mound, and it reaches what's called a minimally stable state with a fixed angle. That is, the slope, if you like, of the sand pile reaches a fixed value. And at that value, you get avalanches of sand of different scales that follow a heavy tail distribution. That was considered to be the correct idealized model for all systems that attract to critical points. Of course, it has its limits, but I think this is a very important point for complex systems generally, because it means that the interplay of the biological and cultural factors will make it extremely difficult for this disease to ever go away. And it's one of the mechanisms that will lead to endemism.Michael Garfield:  So, we’re talking about sand piles, and cascading collapses, and life poised at the edge of chaos, which is exactly what we're seeing here in the U.S. and around the world as the Coronavirus has revealed the inequities of what for people of privilege was an invisible environment, an invisible evolutionary landscape. We talked about this a lot in episode 29, when we were talking about mass extinctions and the relationship between crisis and creative opportunity. I like you're calling forth of Cris Moore’s piece, because his writing on how you take a fine grain look at R0, reveals the heterogeneity of our networks and how opportunity is unequally distributed in space and time. But Brian Enquist has this really cool piece, which calls back to Manfred Laubichler’s piece on the evolutionary fitness landscape. And it reminds me of a statement I saw from William Gibson, who was quoted apocryphally as saying that the future is distributed unevenly.  And, he recently revised it to say that dystopia is distributed unevenly, not just in space and time, but within a single ecosystem or society for agents capable of reaching different affordances –– capitalizing on available free energy, or evolutionary opportunities.So, there's the sense in which the opportunities available to generalists after a mass extinction, the opportunities available to the virus with its high beta mutation strategy, and the opportunities available to us now, socially, are described by the same mathematics. And Brian's got a really beautiful example of this from landscape ecology, and from trees, and how over the history of the human era, we have contributed to a series of radical regime changes in ecological settings that are not always as obvious to us: that this kind of mulching and boiling of possibility and creative destruction is going on in these areas.David Krakauer:  Yeah. I mean, I think your introduction there covers both Melanie Moses’s and Kathy Power's contribution, and elements of Brian's piece. Let’s just jump to Brian's, because I think it fits in with this larger question of the human relationship to the natural world. Because it's not just us, and it's certainly not just animals, it's also plants…the world that sustains us. What Brian is doing is drawing a really interesting parallel between the effects of COVID-19 in our time, and the 1904 blight of Chestnut trees. He makes this point that the first God, if you like, of pathogens was a Roman God of rust, a fungus that infects all sorts of wheats and ryes and apples and so forth, many people are familiar. But I thought that the parallels that Brian drew are extremely interesting at multiple different levels reveals a different kind of complexity, I think.So, this blight was a fungus that seemed to have originated in Southeast Asia. It was transported via trade networks that were global. The primary tissue that this parasite attacks is the vascular tissue thereby reducing the respiration capability of the plant. And it's interesting that the American Chestnut tree defined the American forest. In his telling, it survived for 40 million years, and then in the space of 40 years, it effectively disappeared. And the Chestnut tree interestingly also touched American economic life –– that the wood of the tree is soft and light, and easy to split, it’s very resistant to decay –– it was the basis for construction and the barns and homes on the East coast of America were made from Chestnut. The nut of the Chestnut Tree was a significant source of protein, and very important in rural economies. And so, the Chestnut pandemic was not only about a biological disease that took down the Chestnut tree, but ramified out into culture to have a significant economic impact on the Eastern United States.So that's the first parallel, which I thought was actually rather fascinating. It just makes it very clear, once again, that you can't really separate the impact of biology from the impact on the economy, and the impact on culture. That we have to come to a much better understanding of the entangled nature of reality, and stop pretending in our departments and disciplines that everything can be modularized, because it cannot. So, that was very important to me. He goes on to point out in the extension of the paper that he wrote, which you have linked on this page, he introduces some more technical concepts, which touch on the power law-like results that Per Bak and Jhn Machta describe.In the late 19th century, a Frenchman, François de Liocourt, published a paper called the Management of Silver Fir Forests.  And in that paper, he presents the distribution of tree sizes in the natural state. It's what we would now call, and has have called in our previous episodes, null models. In other words, this is the distribution of tree sizes that you would expect if the system were healthy. And it wasn't until the 1930s that the great Russian mathematician, Andrey Kolmogorov wrote down the equations which describe that distribution using his diffusion equations. And they become now the baseline against which we can measure deviations that are diagnostic of the disease state. And I think that's also very that, Brian points this out, that we always need to understand how far we've moved from the distribution that defines the healthy, and it's no less true for plants, as it is for animals.Michael Garfield: To use that piece on the distribution of tree sizes, I've read elsewhere that we have clear signature that forests around the world are getting younger and shorter. And if we think about, Geoff West’s work on evolutionary networks following a space filling algorithm, that a young, short forest is not filling the available space, filling the opportunity of sunlight as efficiently as an older mature forest. And, there's a way to look at this in a kind of a geopolitical sense as a disrupted regime. This calls to Andy Dobson's remarks recently, on how our rampant development around the world has led to a quadrupling of zoonotic animal origin infections over the last 50 years. That by disrupting wild ecosystems, we're inviting quote unquote revolution from agents that are ordinarily kept in check by the incumbent regimes, like the mature trophic networks.We just issued our institutional statement on current events last night, and we included a link to Jessica Flack’s work on nonviolent power: her study of primate dominance, hierarchies, and policing. You know, there is a way to look at violent policing as an attempt to impose a kind of order that is a system that has not effectively encoded environmental information, and sort of releases these invisible monsters, these invisible troubles, in a way that is very similar to the way that our development and our attempts to exert a kind of technocratic management over the natural world has released all of these infections upon us.David Krakauer: Well, I would just say, I think that Jessica's work or Steve Lansing's work on the beautiful ritualized water irrigation system for the Subak in the Balinese Highlands is an example of that. I think what François de Liocourt did and what in fact Brian has been doing recently is giving us a sense of the invisible order that we're perturbing. It's one of the problems with climate, right? In other words, it's very difficult for the naked eye and the timescales, as you described earlier in which we live, to observe the impact on the system. And we require complexity analogs of microscopes and telescopes and mass spectrometry machines to see the world, properly. And then we need mathematical models to tell us what the equilibrium states of that world are, and what effect we're having on them. I think it's very important to understand that it's very difficult to see the order in a forest with a naked eye, you need to do more work. And one of the things that Brian is saying is that these kinds of models that de Liocrout and Kolmogorov have developed with the necessary microscopes to understand healthy States of complex reality.Michael Garfield:   Absolutely. And this brings us, I think, really gracefully into Melanie Moses’s and Kathy Powers’s piece, because what we're really talking about here is better math and science for fairer social outcomes and justice through empiricism.David Krakauer:   Yes. I think this is a very, very timely contribution, a very important one. And I do want to relate it to exactly the point you just made, and to Brian's point, and to previous contributions which is how we, those of us trying to understand the complex world with highly idealized, mathematical and computational models, remain faithful to it, and just in our projects. I want to give a bit of history here, because I think it's a very important area to understand, so just some of the nuts and bolts: One of the pioneers in mathematical biology, that is the use of mathematics to understand biological phenomenon, was Nicolas Rashevsky and Rashevsky was born at the end of the 19th century in Ukraine, was educated at the university of Kiev. He was an immigrant to the United States where he got a job at Westinghouse Labs in Pittsburgh, and eventually went onto the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in the department of physiology.And in the 1920s and 30s, he read a book that we could have several programs about, Michael, by Darcy Wentworth Thompson, called On Growth and Form, which is one of the defining Vertex of complexity science published in 1917. And in response to that book, which presents a physical theory of the biological world, he wrote his book called Mathematical Biophysics: Physical Mathematical Foundations of Biology. And now, when we look back on that book, we have several very major criticisms of it. One is that it's too idealized. Another is that it's too beholden to the parsimonious dream of physics. Another is that it's a little too concerned with presenting almost a Platonic view of reality, and insufficiently concerned with the complications of reality. Out of Rashevsky’s work came models, or more like chess games inspired by reality than tools for comprehending reality. And this I like to use Rashevsky when I teach, because he represents a persistent challenge to the work we do, because as you move away from the sort of simple description of orbits and charges and fields –– the world that physicists work on –– it just gets worse and worse, and your models slowly metamorphose into metaphors. And this is often true without the practitioners being aware. And you're ultimately left with these rigorous, vacuous, vaporous statements. And I think at this moment in history, numerous well-intentioned people are writing down mathematical models with enormous deducted rigor and absolutely no value. What Melanie and Kathy describe is how the standard model of the epidemic, the SIR model or the SIRS model and so forth, has neglected elements of reality. It's neglected elements of reality in such a way that they are in some endogenous sense, justly, racist, right? And let me explain that.They point out in their article that African-Americans, as we know, are dying from COVID-19 at a rate that are two or four times higher than White Americans. And that per capita cases are higher on the Navajo reservation in our own state, Michael, than in every other U.S. state.Why is this? They go on to point out, well, African Americans tend to live in very dense urban areas. They live in multigenerational households…and as we know, older individuals are more susceptible to this disease. They're less likely to have paid sick leave, and health insurance. And they have a larger number of preexisting medical conditions, such as diabetes and so forth. And exactly the same arguments go for the Native American population: extreme inequalities of health and economic circumstance, a lack of basic services, running water, access to healthcare. And as a consequence, the native population is 17 times more likely to be diagnosed with this disease than the White population. And that's just the facts. And you could argue, look, mathematics doesn't care. You can't accuse a mathematical model of being in some sense, racist because it's just the math. But it's not really true because when you formulate a mathematical model, you make the decision about what to include and what to throw away.The reason I mentioned Rashevsky, who is quite rightly pilloried by my community for oversimplifying the natural world, is I think we should be criticized for not dealing with the critical factors that would allow our models to help those communities at greatest risk. I think what Melanie and Kathy ask is, how should we do this? I will say that the Santa Fe Institute, to be honest, is perhaps one of the places that's been most aware of the importance of these factors –– as you pointed out agent-based models are models that do allow us to include things like the zip code, which is a primary determinant of susceptibility, unfortunately. Network theory allows us to look at the more structured interactions amongst populations instead of treating a population as fully mixed or well-mixed –– so, we have been working on formalisms that allow us to address the factors that models are designed to help us explain and treat. But, I do believe this is a very important interface between the power of mathematics in helping us understand the world, and the hidden ethical suppositions or social assumptions that go into our thinking about our mathematical models.And there's no point in denying that complexity, Melanie and Kathy are right to make us respond to this debate, now more than ever, without compromising the rigorous, empirical quality of the work that we do.Michael Garfield:   Indeed, just as a way of linking back to a super important conversation we've had on the show before, when I had Rajiv Sethi on for episode seven, talking about his work on stereotypes and criminal justice, and then also, Mahzarin Banaji’s 2012 study on the development of racial stereotypes in children: these are examples of too-simple-to-be-useful models, now. The maladaptive over-simplicity of our models has been revealed by this situation, and nobody has the luxury to ignore these realities, anymore. You know, we need new norms because a lot of these things that…again, for convenience, for parsimony, we’ve regarded things like health as a private good, and it's become obvious that it's a public good, and the same can be said for social justice. So, really, what I hear in this is just that we can do better than three-year-olds.David Krakauer:    Yeah. And I think, for the Institute, that we address these very deep issues. I raised Rashevsky for a reason. He was so enamored with the simplicities of physical law and their power to enable the human mind to grasp non-living reality, that he hoped that you could apply the same simplicities to humanity into the living world. And behind that was a kind of aesthetic impulse, as you pointed out, simplicity, but behind models, just as easily there can be an ethical impulse. And, that's what we're describing here, that the move towards these more sophisticated models that encompass some of these essential facts of life should go into how we model and how we formalize complex systems. That doesn't in any way detract from their objectivity, and their mathematical rigor, it just said that the reason we made the decision to include that variable in our models, that we then subject to all of the analysis that we would any variable in the model, is because it's important. It's part of what we're trying to explain. And that's, I think the argument that's being made in this contribution, and it's one that we should all be very aware of.Michael Garfield:   Indeed. And lest we do a disservice to the articles that we've discussed here today, I would really suggest to everyone, if you haven't read these essays yet, or if you haven't gone to the website and looked at the research that we’ve bundled together in our statement on social justice, I really encourage you to do that. Now that you've kind of seen the aerial overview, it's good to land down, and walk around, and get a sense for things in their detail.Do you have any more you want to discuss?David Krakauer:   No, that's it. Thank you, that's great. And thanks everyone for listening, and for taking seriously, the contributions that this community has been providing.
34,Episode Details / Transcript Michael Garfield: Geoffrey West. It is an honor to have you on Complexity Podcast, finally.Geoffrey West: Well, Michael, it's a delight to be here and I'm delighted we've eventually found a mutually convenient time to make it work.Michael Garfield: Well, so let's focus on this fabulous compression and consummation of your work, your book Scale: The Universal Laws of Life, Growth, and death in Organisms, Cities, and Computers. But within this book, there are so many different trajectories that we could take. And you've given so many different interviews about this topic already. It's my hope today that we can carve a refreshingly different path through this and touch on some things that we haven't heard from you before. I guess maybe the place to start is, how did you become a scientist? Let's go all the way back.Geoffrey West: Oh my God, how did I become a scientist? Well, I suppose it's the confluence of many things, like everybody else, and a lot of serendipitous things that happened, but two pieces were central. One is, I was very good at mathematics when I was a kid. That was one thing. So, you know, it was in language I could adapt to without huge difficulties on the one hand. On the other, I was always sort of a curious kid, like most kids are, but I was always pondering, you know, the meaning of life, what of the stars and, you know, all the kinds of things you do when you're a young kid growing up and beginning to become more and more conscious. And I think also what was crucially important was a gradual, semi-conscious realization that, in answering some of the questions that popped up in my life, when it was a scientific answer, it seemed to have much more — a wealth of facts and knowledge and prediction and understanding behind it than the kind of explanations I was given, which mostly came from either folklore or the Bible, because I had a relatively religious upbringing. And even though I still . . . in kind of a strange way, I respect those narratives, I recognize them as something different, but they did play this role that they weren't satisfying in the same way that explanations with some grounding in what we now call science. And that began more and more to play an important role for me.Michael Garfield: So, when this book picks up, you're working at Los Alamos in high-energy physics, and you're sort of taken by a bug to follow a particular path and apply some of this mathematical rigor beyond the domain that's normally thought of as the physical domain into life sciences. And then this brings you into a collaboration with Jim Brown and Brian Enquist, and that feels like a good place to start this.Geoffrey West: Well, I actually in some ways already thought about this many years earlier in teaching, when I was still at Stanford. And one of the things I actually enjoyed was teaching sort of non-physics majors physics. I began to appreciate that because it was extremely challenging. And most of these were pre-meds, not all, but most. And you know, most of them were there just to get the grade and tick the box and so on, but I felt a real challenge to present a cause that I felt, you know, a cultivated, intelligent human being should really be interested in. You know, that is the kind of examples I would choose. So, in so doing that was the first time I started thinking seriously about applying the principles and techniques of physics to biological problems, because I wanted to choose examples that were not just from ordinary day life, but in particular, because there were so many pre-meds, something that might be of relevance to them.And so, I would concoct all kinds of examples about our body, the physiology of our body and so on, and the world around us, ecosystems, very simple examples, some to do with thermodynamics, some to do with the flow of blood, and so on. And I had already at that time sort of come across the original scaling law of all scaling laws, the scaling law about metabolic rate. And we can come and talk about that in a minute, and it intrigued me that there was such a thing and I sort of worked it in to the course just to show them that, look, here's an interesting way of thinking about something that you'd normally think about in the medical world as eating food and digesting it and sending . . . you know, creating metabolic energy to keep you alive. But how interesting it is, that it has this kind of systematic behavior, and what might that mean?And, you know, I sort of left it at that, but of course it planted a seed. Because I always, from the beginning, when I entered physics, I had sort of, because I'd been so impressed by the power of mathematics and the power of rational thinking and the power of — and this was extraordinary; it's something I had great difficulty with — of choosing the right variables in which to write the equations and therefore solve a problem. Because I'd always wanted to apply all of that to something beyond the so-called physical world, this sort of planted the seed, which propagated through. And although I spent the rest of my career at that time — the next 25, 30 years — focused on problems at exactly the other end of the spectrum, namely the elementary particles, fundamental forces of nature, and eventually dark matter and string theory and all these wonderful things, the origin of the universe, marvelous questions. Despite being enamored and passionate about that, I always felt that there was this other side that was, you know, having these extraordinary techniques at hand and this powerful way of thinking and formulating problems. Surely we can apply that to situations that are outside of the traditional physical regime. So that's what got me going. And that's why I was very open to it when the timing came along, even though the sequence of events was quite serendipitous.Michael Garfield: So, this issue of metabolism, you know, it's funny to have you on at this point now that we've already spoken to Luís Bettencourt and Melanie Moses and Chris Kempes about extensions on your work.Geoffrey West: They’ve all worked under me!Michael Garfield: Yeah. So I feel like, you know, we've had such rich conversations about scaling already that I'm kind of torn between taking it even further past those or doubling back and doing some remedial work. But I think as far as history and tracing the development of these ideas is concerned, metabolism feels like a good place to start because metabolism seems like it's what provides the analogical framework that we can use to compare all of these different kinds of things — cities, companies, conventionally understood organisms. And so, could you talk a little bit more about how we understand metabolism in a general way and then how metabolism fits in with these properties that you identify, you know, space filling and terminal units and optimization?Geoffrey West: Sure. Well, first of all, the focus on metabolism is, you know, when you come from a physics background, of course the most natural, the most central. Of course it's also central in biology, but it has been displaced of course, by the genome and the focus on both molecular properties in a very reductionistic way and on information exchange, all of which of course is powerful and important, but in so doing metabolism and the focus on energy has very much taken a back seat in biology. That's a shame because nothing happens without energy and energy is fundamental. And you can't have — at least from my viewpoint — you can't have information exchange, can’t have genes doing what they're doing unless you have energy first. So it's primary. And indeed I would say the evidence strongly points towards metabolism constraining what you can do with genomic networks and so on, and that's a whole other area, but that also relates to how it works in cities.That is that metabolism of the city — that is, how energy and resources flow through the city — is a huge constraint on what the city and its citizens can accomplish in terms of their social networks. You can't have, obviously, information exchange, wealth creation, ideas generated, businesses flourish without energy and resources. So, it's primary. And it of course can be thought of in two different ways typically. One is the way it's traditionally thought of, I would say, in biology and, to some extent, I would say, in economics and therefore social systems, and that is again in a kind of reductionistic way, in biology, you know, it's a bunch of chemical processes, extraordinarily complex chemical processes that are truly remarkable because they take stuff and turn it into life. But that's what's going on inside us somehow — it's kind of amazing, but it's sophisticated chemical processes. That is usually summarized, somewhat glibly, that the currency of energy is this molecule ATP, which it is, one that is the cycle that allows you to function. It happens within cells inside what's called respiratory complexes. Chemical reactions take place within cells. And in one of your more active cells, there could be as many as even a million of such little engines doing these chemical processes, producing this molecule ATP, which is your sort of currency of energy.So that's kind of the fundamental viewpoint of it, the reductionistic, but there's another view, which is the more holistic, integrated view. Because obviously there's a million of those inside your cell, and you have a hundred trillion cells in your body, how you actually function, doesn't know anything. You know, you're not at all conscious that any of that is going on, but you use energy all the time. Here I am waving my hands and talking passionately about this and that! Of course, it may have its origins in those ATP molecules, but something else obviously is going on to be able to translate that into action.And that's the more top-down holistic view, which I took when I started thinking about metabolism. And because one of the things that you recognize about metabolism — about energy in general — is that if you have a system, a highly complex system, like a human body with a hundred trillion cells, you have to supply those with energy in an efficient, roughly democratic fashion. And the way of course we do that is that we have evolved to be a bunch of networks that do that. The most obvious one we’re all familiar with is our circulatory system. Well, we pump blood through our arterial system to take oxygen and other nutrients to the cells which go through this chemical process to produce energy, but they feed the cells and the cells feed the system and so on. It's a continuous feedback loop. What I focused on — and what I became fascinated by — was this other end of the spectrum, macroscopic systemic part of the system in which the network itself is constraining what metabolism can do.And it turns out that is an extremely fruitful way of looking at the system, because it turns out that gives rise to these extraordinary systematic scaling laws, because those scaling laws actually reflect the scaling of the network — or, more generally, of the multiple networks that control your body. And so, from that viewpoint, the fact that even though we are evolved creatures and all creatures evolved by natural selection, and that implies that there is a huge level of historical contingency in, you know, who we are, meaning that all kinds of frozen accidents took place. There were all kinds of special environmental niches we were in, all kinds of survival-of-the-fittest phenomena going on.So, all of these things were going on in this messy, extraordinary, apparently random process, in which case you would think almost nothing systematic would evolve from it. It would all be sort of, not exactly arbitrary, but it would have huge variances across different organisms, which is the way we actually see it because we focus on diversity.We do look very different than an elephant, and we do behave somewhat differently than a mouse. Nevertheless, in terms of anything that you could measure about us, we're actually scaled versions of both an elephant and a mouse, which is about anything we can measure, both our physiology and our life history. And this view, this kind of holistic, top-down view, is that it's not such a surprise because we are all controlled by the same kinds of networks. And it is the mathematics and physics engendered by those networks that are constraining things to behave in similar ways in a predictable scaled fashion, as you go from one small size to a very large size. And so that provided the template for much of the later work.And I'm so delighted; I hadn't realized you talked to — I knew you’d done Luís. I didn't realize you’d also done Melanie and Chris, but of course they all came a little bit later, but they were all . . . I had extremely fruitful collaborations with all of them.Michael Garfield: Well, to the episode that we did with Chris, we spent a lot of time talking about his work with you on this particular issue — you know, the biophysical constraints that are lying behind natural selection.Geoffrey West: Yeah.Michael Garfield: We talked a lot about the emergence of multicellularity and the break points, major evolutionary transitions, that get into some of these issues about the pace at which a cell divides up against the pace at which it's capable of copying its genetic material and so on.One of the questions from our audience that seems relevant to this is about cell types. This is one of those areas where I think your work starts to answer questions about the relationship between metabolism and energy and then also regulation and informational structure. So, Caleb Meredith on Twitter wanted to know why is it that the number of cells in multicellular organisms scale with an exponent of roughly 0.88 to the number of genes. Just to append to that his question, it seems like there is an inference that we can draw from that, and you touch on this in your book, about the number of jobs in a city of a given size and so on. And so, what is going on there? Why would the size of a genetic code constrain or determine the number of cell types?Geoffrey West: So, well, let's see, this is a great question, of course, because it relates to something that is part of my present, ongoing work. Although I must say I'm not making huge progress. And that is, this very general question, which lies at the heart of many complex systems, which complex adaptive systems. And that is the interrelationship between the networks of energy, the physical networks, the infrastructure, the physiology on the one hand and the informational networks. And this question of course relates to it because cells — you know, when you think of a cell you think of its physicality and you certainly think of the physicality of genes, but you normally associate them with encoding information. And so their currency is rather different. Cells, you know, are the centers at a fundamental level of metabolism, of creating metabolic energy. But within those cells, of course, are also genomes that carry information and carry the code. So, one of the things that I've — I was almost going to say railed against, but that's too strong — I've just talked about is that I think it's very misleading only to think of the genome and genomic networks as independent of metabolism, because necessarily they're intertwined.So, I'm going to now generalize the problem because that's the one I'm most interested in. And that is, if you think of the brain, which is even more extreme than just in terms of ordinary tissue, because the brain clearly is designed to exchange and process information and the emphasis on the brain in terms of research and understanding, is almost entirely in terms of its neural networks, both in terms of how information is exchanged, how it's stored, what are the modularities in that network and so on. However, none of that works, as I said earlier, without the fact that you have an artery that goes out of your heart, goes straight up to your brain to give it all that energy so that it can do that. And those two networks, the neural network and the circulatory system to the brain, are necessarily intertwined and integrated. They're not arbitrarily there. They're carefully tuned to one another. And as just a side comment to that, you know, when people do FMRI studies or just ordinary MRI studies, they don't measure, of course, the neural aspect of your brain. What they actually are measuring is the physical part — the flow of blood. You know, and they’re assuming that that's a proxy for the neural network. And the question is, well, yes, obviously they're into it, but there's very, very little work, if any, on the interface between them.Going to the language of the scaling laws, and the question of numbers of cells that is raised, the brain is unusual in several respects. First, as an organ within the body, it is almost unique in that it does not scale linearly with the size of the body. So, put slightly differently, elephant's brain is as a proportion of its body mass, much smaller than that of ours, which is much smaller as a proportion than that of a mouse. So you need proportionately less brain, the bigger you are. So that's one curious fact about the brain and you know that, you know, when you see babies. If you actually look at them, you know, as grown-ups, they have enormous heads relative to their bodies. And, indeed, effectively stops growing, well, certainly by about five years old — done. And that's it. And then you sort of sit with this little head on top of this big body. Of course, we don't see it that way, but that's effectively what it is. So the other thing about the brain is that the white matter and the gray matter often scale superlinearly, that is, you have more of it per capita. It's one of the few places in biology where you get such scaling, whereas the regular number of cells in the brain or body decreases with size as you get bigger than the proportion does. And that is reminiscent of a system which we've also studied, and you've heard about it. That is of course of cities, because cities are also a very close integration of, on the one hand, its physicality, the various buildings, roads, and all the various networks of supply, the transport networks, the roads, the gas lines and electric lines — on the one hand its physicality, with, of course, its information exchanges, neural networks, which we call social networks. That is the exchange of information between people. And in that image, one can think of the city as the stage and the infrastructure that is there to facilitate social interaction, to facilitate, to increase information exchange so that, you know, when you look at the scaling of a city with size, in terms of its infrastructure, the part that you sort of naively think of as the city, that scales like biology, sublinearly, meaning the bigger the city, the less infrastructure, whatever it is you need per capita in a systematic way.However, that facilitates information exchange and you get more of that — more social attraction, therefore more innovation, more wealth creation, more disease, more COVID-19 the bigger the city, because the city is doing what it should be doing. It's increasing interactions, the bigger you are. So, if you live in New York, you're going to get, you know, more buzz, more excitement, more activity. You're going to get higher wages. You're going to be in a more innovative environment, but you're going to get more disease and your liable to get more COVID-19 than you are if you live in little old Santa Fe.Michael Garfield: Yeah. So for folks that are familiar with your work, you frequently bring up this 15% increase — the dividend comes with per capita doubling of innovation with scale in cities, which you mention in your book. It can be interpreted as a 15% savings in the physical infrastructure of the energy usage.I think we're getting closer to the heart, if you will, of this issue I wanted to raise with you today, which is that the brain and the heart are not scaling in the same way. So that's like part A. Part B is that the 15% savings doesn't just stay saved. It's fed back into the system. The way we think about it in companies is, oh, that's 15% more I can spend on increasing my productivity. So, the demands for information processing and the metabolic demands seem to be tugging at each other. And this sort of opens up this whole question about the hypothetical cap on city size. You know, you talk about why don't we have mammals the size of Godzilla, and it has to do with the networks of distribution and the difficulty of being able to push resources through them. And I remember when we had Brian Arthur on the show, you know, he was making a case that we have scaled the economy to a point where the resource allocation needs to move from productivity. Like you were talking about earlier about the growth of an individual human, that it moves at some point from productivity to distribution or maintenance costs. And that we're at a point now where the economic system is large enough that we may have to start pushing resources through these networks actively through stuff like basic income.That's a sort of a multidimensional question, but I'm curious, based on the tension between the demands of the power laws governing information processing and the power laws governing metabolic rate, what you think is the cap on the size of a city or on the size of a global economy before it has to go through a kind of a phase transition into a different kind of architecture in order to persist.Geoffrey West: Well, that's a big question, you know, the whole thing. I’ll try to dance around it and then try to answer your question.So, first, the essentials. We didn't quite clarify this, but the essential difference between biological organisms and cities — let's take cities and, by implication, economies — is that in biology, the networks, the ones associated with metabolism, associated with distributing energy and resources, are dominated a simplistic idea of efficiency. That is, how our circulatory system has evolved such that if we make any change in it, you know, you double the size of the fifth branch of your arterial system, or you halve the size of the eighth branch, whatever. If you make any change, your heart will have to work harder. That's sort of the idea — well, that's averaged of course across all mammals. And if you do that, that's a fundamental input into the derivation of the equations that give rise to the scaling laws and to the quantitative form of the scaling laws.So, that gives rise — that's economy of scale: bigger you are, the less you need, in that case, per cell per capita to stay alive, gives rise to two major things. One is it gives rise to the concept of the pace of life decreasing with size. So elephants sort of walk slower — they don't actually walk slower. They just look like they walked slower. Their heart certainly beats slower. The whole metabolism is slower than a mouse. All in a systematic way. That's one thing: so the pace of life decreases.The other is that this sublinear behavior, the bigger you are the less per capita, gives rise to a cessation of growth. When you feed that into the growth equations, that gives rise to the idea that you grow faster at the beginning, and then gradually you stop and you reach a stable kind of asymptotic size, and you live most of your life at that size. So that's sort of the idea. And then you die, by the way — that's built into these equations, unfortunately. And that stable configuration of course plays a fundamental role in the generic stability and sustainability of life itself, that there is a stable configuration that the mature organism lives in, okay. There's exceptions to this and so on, but that's sort of the general features.Now, contrast that with social behavior — socioeconomic behavior and cities. There, we of course do have economies of scale in terms of the infrastructure, the buildings and roads and so on. But we have this new thing, which is the dynamics of social networks, which cities have actually evolved without. As I said earlier, cities are the engine that drives, if you like, social networks, or facilitates social networks; a great city increases social connectivity. And that social connectivity has a characteristic, which is quite different than biological networks, because built into it is positive feedback, A talks to B, B talks to C, C talks to D, D talks back to A . . . there's this conversation goes on and that has positive feedback in it. It produces ideas, produces innovation, almost all of which, even though it's going on all the time, are useless and pointless, even probably to the people involved in them, but that's part of it. But what is remarkable is, every once in a while, it produces the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics or a Google or a Microsoft or whatever.And that's the wonder of it, but it is the sort of fundamental source of innovation and cities are the engine we have evolved to facilitate that. That positive feedback mechanism gives rise to something quite different than we see in biology. It gives rise to this superlinear scaling. The bigger you are, the more you have per capita: more social interactions per capita, therefore the greater wealth per capita, the greater ideas, more ideas per capita, the more disease per capita, etc.And that superlinear behavior, if you now feed it into the same growth equations that gave rise to the stability of biological organisms, has a remarkable effect. It gives rise to the open-ended growth of socioeconomic organisms like cities. And so we have a distinct difference, two different categories coming from the same basic mathematics, one giving rise to a kind of highly stable situation, the other giving rise to an open-ended growth situation, which of course is the paradigm under which, especially in the last couple of hundred years, modern society operates. We operate in the paradigm that we need to have open-ended growth to sustain the economy. So that's the structure. And one of the nice things about this work is that it gives very succinct, well-defined mathematical underpinnings for all that, including many, many predictions that all agree with data.And so, it's a good starting point to ask this question about are there maximum sizes to these things. You know, can you go on making organisms as big as you like? You go from elephants and dinosaurs to blue whales, the biggest organism that has ever existed on the planet — could you make something ten or a hundred times bigger, so to speak? Could something like that evolve? Well, you sort of intimated earlier, the answer is, if you look at all the equations, it turns out highly unlikely. Um, you couldn't have a Godzilla because it turns out that the way those scaling laws work, you simply . . . The whole point of the networks is to supply cells. And, as the system grows, the distance between the capillaries, which feed cells, it gets further and further apart. So that at some stage you simply can't give enough energy to the cells and the system can’t survive. So, whales come pretty near that maximum limit. I would say it's extremely unlikely that there could be larger organisms, with one caveat: given the kinds of body designs that have evolved, and the kind of chemistry that has evolved. So obviously there are always caveats like that.Now go to the other side of this mathematics, which is the positive feedback loops giving rise to superlinear behavior, which I say gives rise to open-ended growth. Well, turns out if you look at all that, and you just take cities as an example, and you ask the question, could you imagine Tokyo, which is 35 million people, being 70 or a hundred million people? Could you imagine Los Angeles, which is whatever it is, 10 or 12 million people, being 50 million people? Let's take Los Angeles. Well, there's nothing in the equations that stops it. It just could go on just adding on and adding on. That's the first sort of initial, superficial reaction, but then you realize something that is not in the equations, actually. It could be put it in principle. And that is, Los Angeles already has a problem supplying all of its selves, so to speak. It has already 12-lane freeways or whatever it is, something humungous, and they’re clogged. So if you are to supply all of the cells, meaning all of the individual buildings, all the individual people, in one unified network — this is very important — in one, all connected to the same network, which we call Los Angeles, then, if you kept adding and adding and adding, the only way to do it, of course, is to build freeways that are not 12 lanes, but are 25 lanes, and to have rail lines that are not four rail lines, but are ten rail lines, or to completely change the whole transport system in some magical way. Even with electric cars, I'm not sure we could do it, but . . .Michael Garfield: Or in tunnels underground.Geoffrey West: You know, so that's the point. If you change — that's why I put the caveat about organisms. If, in some science-fiction world, which may or may not be science fiction, you might be able to invent different physicalities, different solutions, in terms of not necessarily the transport of people, but the communication between people, because the point of a city is, and the definition in this way of thinking of a city is, people in the city have to be connected to the same network. So one of the ways you could define it, just to make that a little clearer, is, you would have to define you would be part of a city. If you interact with someone else in that city, say, at least once a week, it could be someone, it could be anyone. Do I go to the store once a week? You have to interact socioeconomically once a day, once a week; you could define the rate, but you have to have a cutoff.By the way, it's an interesting definition because you could imagine that you live in Los Angeles and commute to Santa Fe once a week. And you would interact once a week with people in Santa Fe and Los Angeles. And there's no reason you couldn't be citizens of both. But anyway, the point is what you could imagine. So one of the things you could imagine is you completely redesign the city in some way, or you make some extraordinary new inventions in terms of communication and transportation, or you continue to build the city. And what happens, and which we already see happening, is the city alchemizes, it breaks off. That is, even though it is physically contiguous — it just goes on and on and on — it's actually not one city, it's two cities or three cities, four cities. Each one, which is effectively semi-autonomous. And the social networks of one are only very loosely connected to the social networks of the other, even though their infrastructure is continuous. And of course we see developing examples of that.Michael Garfield: So that is linked to, when we were talking to Melanie Moses, the ant hive as an adaptation to the constraints on the size of insects . . .Geoffrey West: Yes.Michael Garfield: . . . and this idea that, you know, the social organism is it kind of balkanization of insect processes in a sense that rather than one big thing, you know, you get the equivalent amount of mass, you know, Ricard Solé would call a liquid brain.And so this kind of question begs in relation to comments that you made later on I think it's page 406 in the paperback version of Scale, if readers are listening . . .Geoffrey West: Ah, yes, I remember. Of course!Michael Garfield: In the paperback version, page 406, you're talking about the longest-lived companies.Geoffrey West: Oh yes.Michael Garfield: And how all of these companies are a relatively modest size operating in highly specialized, niche markets, that they look very different from Fortune 500 companies. There's this question. Due to the fragmentation of the social network that we've experienced during this pandemic, and you're seeing a lots of people citing your book on both sides of the argument for the future of mega cities. Does this suggest that, rather than a sort of megalopolis, that we get sort of smaller polycentric coordinated networks of cities? I guess that's the question, or: how does polycentrism fit into an understanding of the way that this is going to scale?Geoffrey West: Yes, of course. Pandemic is extremely interesting in regards to the future of cities because it is an urban phenomenon predominantly, obviously, because that's where most of the people live. And, as I said earlier, it spreads faster and there are many more cases in cities that are larger. So cities play a predominant role. And, by the way, again, a side comment, cities of course are the determinant of the future of the planet anyway. You know, one of the things that has intrigued me about getting involved in trying to understand cities and why I've been so passionate about it is I believe very strongly that it is the key, the absolute key to global sustainability in the future of the planet. And I'm still disappointed how few people recognize that the city is the key.And not only that. It plays a special role because one of the things that we've learned and seems to be sort of in our DNA is that we are social creatures and that has been hugely enhanced by our discovery or invention of language and our communication skills that, again, leads to those positive feedback mechanisms and the huge benefits that we have got from that, which has given us the kind of quality and standard alive to which many of us are privileged to have. But it's also so . . . it's almost diabolical, or maybe you could think of it also as poetic justice, but the very mechanisms of social networks that give rise to our huge success — in material terms, anyway — is the very source of our weakness.And that's what we see in COVID-19 and the pandemic, because the same dynamic — indeed, the same mathematics — that governs the spread of ideas and the growth of innovation and the growth of cities and social systems and economies, that same dynamic is the dynamic, at least, that the spread of disease and in particular of the COVID-19. And we have to come to terms with that, but it's not just COVID-19; it's also spread of other negative aspects of human behavior, antisocial behavior, of crime, of other disease, of corruption, and so on.So, coming to terms with that, and understanding that balance between the good, bad, and ugly that are inherent in the dynamic and social networks, is crucial. And in terms of the future of the city, I would say that if there are no changes in the way we do business, which is a big question mark and we can return to that momentarily, we've seen this: if you decrease social connectivity in order to limit antisocial behavior, everything from the transmission of disease to crime, then of course you decrease social entrepreneurship, ideas, and so forth.Now, the thing that has saved us during this pandemic, we all know, is sort of what you and I are doing now, when we could have done this. Maybe I don't know if we would've done. We probably wouldn't because podcasts are by their very nature through the internet, but we could have done this face to face in principle. And I would argue that the vast majority of our meaningful social interactions are in what I call four-dimensional space, namely, the real space of being able to be near, have up, down, and sideways, so to speak, but also be able to smell you and touch you and feel you, I mean, metaphorically, maybe, but to be there with you, you know, and see the nuances of what's happening and what's happening around you. And this is the very essence of and the soul of human interaction. We need that.And of course that is one reason cities have been so successful, is it engenders that. So, going to this question, that what we need to keep acting and, in fact, to enhance social interaction, but how do we do it by social distancing? And of course we've learned how to do it. We have Zoom and Skype and all the other mechanisms and they serve a purpose. And they've done remarkably well, I must say, I'm amazed how well they've done, but they are two-dimensional. They’re soulless, they're not four-dimensional, and unless we invent — which we may well — much more sophisticated versions, we're kind of stuck with having to agglomerate together in physical, three-dimensional space and be with one another. And there's nothing more satisfying then having an exciting get-together, have a group of people creating new ideas, having discussions, watching a football game together, watching a film together, going to the theater, having sex together, and so on.This is what life is, and I speak with no expertise, but I feel that's in our DNA. That is who we are. And so it's very hard for me to see that, despite, you know, an aversion at the moment by some to urban living because of the pandemic, but when the new, better, stable configuration evolves in the next year or two, cities will gradually go back to the same trajectory they were on. I mean, there may be changes. I'm not denying that there certainly will be changes. You know, there may be some very positive changes. There may be limitations on transport and limitations on transport, you know, in this picture I saw this morning, I think in The New York Times, pictures of cities where, you know, they're closing roads and the restaurants bring more tables out onto the sidewalk and onto the road. Fantastic. And of course, actually in some ways that increases social conduct. That's why you're in the city — you want that!So I must say I don't — you know, after all, it's kind of weird. I don't live in a big city, but I recognize the criticality of having big cities. And, as I said earlier, more importantly, really, perhaps more importantly is, that the future of the planet is completely dependent upon the future of our cities.
35,Episode Details / Transcript Geoffrey West (continuing from Episode 35): I would argue that the vast majority of our meaningful social interactions are in what I call four-dimensional space, namely, the real space of being able to be near, have up, down, and sideways, so to speak, but also be able to smell you and touch you and feel you, I mean, metaphorically, maybe, but to be there with you, you know, and see the nuances of what's happening and what's happening around you.

I don't live in a big city, but I recognize the criticality of having big cities. And, as I said earlier, more importantly, really, perhaps more importantly is, that the future of the planet is completely dependent upon the future of our cities.(Beginning of new dialogue for Episode 36:)Michael Garfield: So you raise an interesting point, which is that our social networks now have become somewhat decoupled from geography. The, that the people that you’re talking with most frequently are not necessarily the people in your neighborhood. So that seems like it adds a complicating dimension to all of this. Because if we’re referring to a city as precipitating within a social network, as that engenders, we now have what I love this term that historian William Irwin Thompson uses the noetic polity rather than the geographic polity. And there’s another axis across which all of this is happening that seems to complicate coordination at scale in certain ways.ACtioN Network member Kasey Klimes wanted to ask about how you understand the relationship between the scaling of social networks and the mechanics of it, cooperation and competition, which seems related if you’ll indulge this to another question from Moritz Wolowitz on information flow and how this is connected to — you brought up earlier that it’s sort of limited by the ability of a network to distribute information or nutrients to its terminal units, individuals involved. So, no, I think of the problems of our recent attempts at this digital transformation to scale human social interaction to the size of the planet. And you look at something like Facebook, which seems almost like it’s running on waste heat generated by outrage. You know, it’s like it’s actually built on harvesting the dissipation of effort that is created by faulty networks. And, you know, at least with the electrical grid we came up with a way of, you know, this AC/DC solution for this. And this question of the city as a sort of model organism here is not just about people connecting to each other in the city. It’s about people connecting to each other outside of the city. It’s people connecting across and isolating themselves within affinity groups. So, I’m curious how you see this internet layer affecting the way that the city as social reactor actually evolves and how that is fundamentally different from a city of the nineteenth century.Geoffrey West: Yeah, well, cities of course have changed or evolved tremendously from medieval times — and earlier, of course — all the way through the nineteenth century. Big changes in the nineteenth century because of the Industrial Revolution, and the big growth of cities. That was the beginning, so to speak, of the Anthropocene and the growth of huge urban centers and a fruit of the twentieth century. And one of the things that changed, of course, was mobility in the cities. And that relates directly to your question, because — let me just go back a little bit. A city, as I said earlier, is this integration of, on the one hand, information networks, social networks, exchanging ideas, information, and so on . . . the intertwining and integration of that with the physical networks, because, whoever you are, it doesn’t matter what medium you use, whether you were back in medieval times and you could only walk or whether you’re in the twenty-first century and you can, if you’ve got a car or your private plane or use your internet, you have to be somewhere. I mean, that’s the constraint. Drawing wonderful pictures of networks sort of up there in the cloud, yes, there is, topologically, that’s what they are. You know, there’s nodes, nodes connect by links to other nodes and so on and so forth, and we get these wonderful networks. Yes, but that’s a metaphor, actually, for what’s going on, because every node has to be someplace. You have to be, you know, in your kitchen, in your bathroom, in your office, on the train — you have to be somewhere. It doesn’t matter how you’re communicating. And that is the hegemony of the infrastructure. What it really is, is the hegemony of Newton’s law of gravitation, and that infrastructure has to house you and support you.So, it’s inevitable that these are intertwined no matter what the stage of evolution of the city is. Now, the change has been, of course, going back to what I said a moment ago, the increased flexibility of mobility. That has changed tremendously. It’s gone from being purely walking and occasional use of the horse, to more use of the horse, to carriages and, ultimately, the invention of the automobile. And now, of course, we’ve relieved ourselves of that with both the airplane, taking us between cities, between continents and, even more so, to the internet, which superficially relieves us of this constraint. But of course it still doesn’t, as I mentioned a moment ago. It doesn’t matter who you are. It doesn’t matter how sophisticated your IT connections are. You gotta be somewhere, you know, so that’s it. And one of the things that comes out of simple models of trying to put that into mathematics, actually, is going back to something you brought up earlier — that 15 percent gain that is arising from the positive feedback of social interactions, social networks, either in your local environment or across boundaries, across countries, by whatever means, but they’re still social networks that have this positive feedback. That 15 percent gain is related directly to the 15 percent savings on infrastructure of a city.So those two, by intertwining the networks mathematically in models, one sees that those two 15 percents are not independent. That one drives the other, and can’t be disconnected from the other, that still leaves open the question: To what extent, ultimately, as we develop more sophisticated ways of communication, despite having to be tied to a place, does the place matter less and less? I think that’s the issue. Does it matter? And this exercise that we’ve been going through during the pandemic is an extremely good example of that, of course. We can still be the Santa Fe Institute, even though the place is closed, and still carry on our seminars and still communicate with one another and still feel some connection to the collective, so to speak. And the Institute still functions. But does it? that’s the great question. Does it actually function, really, when we don’t actually see each other, we’re not actually at the blackboard together, writing down equations and saying, “No, that’s obviously wrong. What about this idea?” and so on and so forth. Or sitting around in the morning saying, “Did you see that stupid film last week?” Or “Did you see that football game?” And say, “You watch football?” The whole stuff of human interaction is very hard to duplicate, and I talked about that earlier.So, I don’t know the answer. Let me tell you my intuition, which is not based on science. It’s just based on intuition. My intuition is that, yes, we will become a little freer, but fundamentally very little will change qualitatively. There may be some quantitative changes, but qualitatively, qualitatively, we still need to have institutions. We need to have universities. We need to have offices. I’m intrigued, by the way, by the announcement of Facebook, in particular, since you mentioned it, that people don’t have to come to the office anymore. I mean, not just in this interim period, but possibly into the foreseeable future.I sincerely doubt that that will happen. I think it might for maybe six months, a year after things become sort of normalized. But I think eventually people will return to be in a place together. However, having said that, the phenomenon of being able to work at home, to have free, more flexible hours, to not be clogged down by the kinds of traffic and mobility problems we have — that will have a positive, lasting effect. To what degree, I don’t know, but it will. I think that will be, and indeed it was already beginning to happen, as we know, in a small way prior to it. And, indeed, one of the outcomes of a discontinuity in the social fabric that the pandemic has caused, which other previous things have caused, which may not be necessarily negative, like the Industrial Revolution is that, what it does, it speeds up things that were already beginning to happen in some nascent way. And I think that’s a fascinating dynamic. So, it will speed up things that were already happening, which ones when the dust settles become sort of part of the social fabric long term – hard to say. But I do suspect this idea of working remotely and having flexible hours and living a more flexible life in general would evolve.By the way, I just was thinking, one of the things I wrote about in my book was, I mentioned that after the Second World War, things changed, there was a big boom, all kinds of things that were already happening before the war were accelerated. And it was an extraordinary period, I think, and there was great innovation and great technological progress. And one of the things that some of what we would now call futurists were thinking about is, my God, what’s going to happen to the workweek? We won’t need to work 40 — then 48 — hours a week. And what are we going to do? And two people that I quote in the book, one was Sir Charles Dickens, the grandson of the Charles Dickens, and the other was John Maynard Keynes, the great economist. Both suggested that this will be a big crisis, social crisis, and we will have to go to at most a 20-hour working week. And the big crisis is, what in the hell are people going to do with all their free time? Which is amazing. Of course, the work week did decrease to 44, then 40, roughly, but it stayed pretty much the same.And, in fact, I would argue that people, especially in the United States, work harder than they ever did in some ways. People have this obsession, and compulsion, and anxiety to be working outside at the office. And so one of the curious things that I think is going to happen is how we reconcile this expansion of the workweek. I mean informal expansion; it’s still technically supposed to be 40 hours a week — with this extraordinary freedom, which is the kind of thing that Keynes and Dickens thought would happen. That you’d be free and you could work at home and so on, but in the way that is relaxed. You’d be reading lots of books and relaxing for most of your time, and then for these few 10 to 20 hours, you’re doing something that was productive.By the way, the only people they thought would work more than 40 hours — in fact, they thought it might have to go up to over 50 hours — were scientists and technicians because of the increase in technology. So it’s sort of interesting.So, this is also a lesson in why it’s very dangerous to speculate too much about the future. It’s good to think about it. It’s fun. But when you have people like Keynes, an extraordinary man, you know, getting it all wrong, you know that you’re on dangerous ground, trying to think through carefully what might be the case in the future.Michael Garfield: Like you just said, the way that we measure the work has everything to do with it. You know, you give this beautiful history of the development of the concept of fractals in this book. And, you know, specifically talking about the measurement of the coastline of Britain. And I think it’s just one of those areas where perhaps the way that we consider, the way that we actually model the workweek, the ruler is just too long. The more granularity we bring to that investigation, the more we find people answering emails on their phone in bed, and it changes everything. And so we’re back to — like you said, this is an anxiety-driven phenomenon that people, in the U.S., anyway, feel that they have to work all the time. And it seems linked to — can you talk about the stress costs of benefiting from a social reactor and the superlinear scaling of innovation?So, like, here we are at the meat, finally, the question I’ve been really eager to raise with you, which is a question you don’t dare answer in the book, but I think very wisely raise and leave us all hanging to contemplate, which is how innovation can continue to accelerate in an open-ended way when, as you say, ideas and innovations, they inspire and require energy and lots of it, you know. So it’s one thing to talk about whether the 12-lane highways within Los Angeles can accommodate all the traffic, and it’s another thing to talk about whether the veins, the pseudopods reaching out from LA into the surrounding areas, are going to find enough to eat.And so we’re finally at the place in your book where you raise the issue of, you know, can we come up with a principled way of understanding a complexity science for sustainability, and part of that issue, to loop this into the issue of anxiety and the need to or that the way that the momentum of the economy seems to be to push work into smaller and smaller capillaries within one’s life. You know, you talk about how a typical human being now lives significantly longer than the time between major innovations. So, there’s the one thing, which is energy capture. Do we actually have the resources on this planet to sustain this growth? And then the other links to the question about balkanization and polarization in these social networks as they scale beyond a sustainable threshold, and this issue of the crisis of growing so fast that we collapse seems to be, again, partly informational and partly metabolic. And I’ve gotten a little bit ahead of it, but I’d love for you to unpack the finite time singularity in the growth of cities and explain why you think this in particular is up against the assumption of infinite growth and the paradigm that we can just innovate our way out of everything.Geoffrey West: Yeah. Okay. Good. Very good. Yeah. So, you’re right. I mean, the last part of my book or last chapter or so of my book, I got into this and I was taking, what was this whole structure been developed for understanding scaling laws and move structure of organisms, and then cities and companies, and so on, and growth, and some questions about evolution, and so forth.I sort of took it to its “logical conclusion,” and it led to some very disturbing questions and potentially disturbing conclusions. And I sort of left it up in the air because partly I didn’t have the answer, but I’m happy to speculate about it. And partly because it was a little different in character to the rest of the book. So, let me just go back to what we were saying. We said earlier that in biology, we have this sublinear scaling, this economy of scale — the bigger you are, the less you need per capita per cell. And that leads to finite growth. That is, organisms typically stop growing after a rapid growth in childhood, and they remain stable till they die, roughly. And that is in contrast to cities in particular, but also would-be economies, okay, they have this superlinear scaling: the bigger you are, the more per capita, more ideas, more innovation, more wealth, blah, blah, blah, per capita.And that gives rise to open-ended growth when you put it in the same equations, which is great, because you have a lovely kind of consistent package. You have these, these networks that have positive feedback in them, social networks giving rise to, because of that positive feedback building on each other gives rise to superlinear behaviors. The more we get together, the more we interact, the more ideas, and the more we sort of get out of that in terms of socioeconomic activity per capita, and that leads to open-ended growth, all of which we see and all of which agrees both qualitatively and quantitatively with the data. So, it’s very nice.However, it has a disturbing consequence. One I’ve already mentioned. One is, life gets faster the bigger you are and you feel it. I mean, you feel that, you know, viscerally in terms of social interactions, life gets faster. And so you already have that problem. Okay. So life gets faster. We’ll come back to that, because it can have dire consequences. And one of them, by the way — you mentioned that I mentioned in the book is that, in the past, typically in a human being’s lifespan, which of course was significantly less than it is now, things didn’t change dramatically typically. And I grew up in such a situation. I mean, that is, the expectation was that life wouldn’t be that different, you know, 50, 60 years later — which it is, of course, considerably different. Now people’s lifespan encompasses at least one and probably two major innovations, paradigm shifts.So, that has all kinds of social and psychological implications in terms of producing a sense of anxiety, a sense of the floor shifting under your feet, and a sense of insecurity generally. So, one of the things this open-ended growth gives rise to also is that, if you follow the equations through, it gives rise to the possibility of something that is mathematically called a finite time singularity. A finite time singularity simply means that, as the system grows bigger and bigger, it reaches an infinite size in a finite time. Which is ridiculous; you can’t be infinitely big in a finite time. It means that, you know, that would imply that 10, 20, 50, 100, even 500 years, I don’t know, the economy will be infinite. The number of AIDS cases will be infinite. The amount of wages – obviously crazy. And indeed, that is crazy. And the equations sort of tell you what happens. Before you get there, the system stagnates and collapses.Well, we’ve seen arguments like that before, like the Malthusian argument, but this is different. This is different because one of the things it says here is yes, you can avoid that collapse by doing, the critics of Malthus said, namely, you didn’t take into account that we’re going to innovate, that we do innovate. And in fact, that was the criticism of the Club of Rome, of Ehrlich and The Population Bomb, and so on. They made, you know, especially in Ehrlich’s case, basically outrageous predictions that were wrong because you just assumed everything was stayed the same. And of course it doesn’t. And that’s the hub of the counter-argument, which is not only a powerful one, but is in fact what’s happened — we innovate. We make major paradigm shifts that lead to effectively starting the clock all over again. We basically reinvent ourselves. The Industrial Revolution being of course the major one, but, you know, we discover oil, we invent the automobile, we invent the telephone, we invented IT, we invented the computer . . . all these things are paradigm shifts, effectively. And they sort of reset the clock.So, this reinvention is critical and it happens, but, according to this theoretical framework, yes, that’s the way you avoid collapse. You can sort of almost state it as a theorem: if you want to have open-ended growth indefinitely, you have to reinvent yourself systematically in some periodic fashion so that you effectively set the clock back to zero and start over again. That’s sort of the image. However, built into that mathematics is not a terrible consequence. That is, yes, you could do that, but you have to do it faster and faster. Yes, you can innovate, but next time you got to do it even quicker, and the time after that, even quicker in a systematic way. So it’s like being on a treadmill that’s accelerating, and at some stage you’ve got to jump off the treadmill onto another treadmill that’s accelerating even faster, and you have to keep jumping faster and faster, and so on. Of course, that leads to socioeconomic heart attack, is the idea. And the image that I presented in the book was a Sisyphean image. That is one of Sisyphus, who — you remember who Sisyphus was? He was a king. He was sort of like Trump. Who thought he was infallible, didn’t give a shit about anything. He’s the king of the universe, screw everybody else. And the gods punished him as they will Mr. Trump, by condemning him to roll this big ball, this big block ball, up the mountain to the top. And then it would roll down again and he would have to go down and roll it back up again, and he had to do that for eternity.So, we’re like that, but we’re much worse. Because Sisyphus was fortunate. The rock and the mountain remained the same every time. So he had to roll, so it was fine. Ours, unfortunately, every time you get to the top and it rolls down, the ball gets bigger and the mountain higher. So, you have to roll it up higher and you have to do it faster and faster. That’s the problem. So the idea is that, yes, you can avoid collapse by innovation and shifting paradigms, but you have to do it faster and faster, and a paradigm shift or a major innovation is only a stop gap measure. That is, it is not a permanent solution. You are condemned like Sisyphus to keep doing it ad infinitum. But then you can make the kind of reductio ad absurdum argument that, of course, then we would have to do something like invent something analogous to the internet eventually sort of every eight months, then every six. It would be nuts. So obviously you can’t do that.So, the question is, is that avoidable, or are we condemned to complete collapse eventually? Because we’re getting close. Because already, you know, we went from the computer, to laptops in, I don’t know, 40 years. I don’t know — whatever it was. We went from mainframe computers to laptops in 20 years. I don’t know; I’m making up these numbers, actually. And then from laptops to IT in maybe 15 years, and it’s going to get shorter and shorter. Who knows what the next one — there will be ones. It may be driverless cars may have, you know, a paradigm shift. Who in the hell knows. So I got very despondent after this because it’s hard for me to see a way out. Until I realized that I was confounding something. And I was confounding something that we have all started to do in the last 20 to 30 years. And that is confounding the idea of innovation with technology.When you think of the word “innovation,” at least I, anyway — and I think most people think of, oh, a new technology, some do widget or gadget, some super-duper iPhone, Alexa, driverless automobile, or something. Something, anyway, but you always think of technology these days. But, of course, innovation is fortunately much broader than that. And innovation, of course, there’s been innovations that are not necessarily technological. They might be cultural. They might be . . . I mean, you could — I just made this up. You could argue that Marxism and communism was a major innovation. It was for part of the world and still plays a crucial role, you know, on the planet, actually. But it wasn’t innovation. It was cultural.Michael Garfield: Pardon for interrupting, but this really links quite strongly to two other pieces from SFI. That one was Luís Bettencourt’s work on introducing new alleys and streets into a slum, you know, to multiply the capital areas in there to get the resources. That’s linked to a presentation that Sam Bowles and Wendy Carlin just gave on the return of this mesoscopic piece of the economy that is not the market or the state, but it is . . . like, neighborhood, a sense of solidarity and community and virtue. And there’s a link between the kind of cultural innovation that you’re talking about and the ways that it assists in the distribution of resources, and the efficiency of a hypothetical future economy, by making it less an issue of a single giant heart pumping into all of these little areas and then doing something kind of like the octopus nervous system where you have your little smaller pumps throughout it, or the Stegosaurus brain with the ganglion in the hips. Anyway, that’s just . . .Geoffrey West: Absolutely. No, the point is there might be cultural revolutions, potential shifts that need to do this. And of course one of the — what you want to do with that is to get away from the hegemony of open-ended growth being the only way we can keep society the way it is. So one of the fundamental questions is, can we have the kind of vibrant high standards and quality of living that we have with innovation and new ideas without growth? No one knows the answer to that. Maybe, but I think going along with that would have to be some kind of social or cultural revolution. And I say that, especially, I used the word social because in the work that we did, this superlinear behavior, which is sort of underneath it all, all comes from the dynamics of social networks, and the question is, is that so much in our DNA, that built into social networks is if you sort of took the causal connections, open-ended growth. Is that sort of inevitable, or can we still do the kinds of things we do and still do it without having this obsession with open-ended growth and sort of have our cake and eat it, too?And the two new game changers — the one we’ve already talked about, and that is, we still don’t know the long-term effects of the internet and its connectivity and what it does. I’m dubious about that as the origin of a solution, but it will play a part in the solution. But the other curious thing is to do with the election of Donald Trump. And here I’m going way out there — I’ll probably be thrown out, probably be fired by the Institute after this — is the election of Donald Trump, which, in this context, gives me hope. Because it’s a very interesting example of something that most people thought could not happen.And that is that, up until Donald Trump came on the scene, I think it was taken for granted throughout society, the complete spectrum of society, that it relied on rational discourse, exposing the truth, we agree on the facts. I mean, of course, there’s greyness around all of these, but, you know, there’s a certain discourse, the rule of law, we obey laws. We have respect for others. We treat people equally and with some sensitivity — those are sort of the fabric of society and what has been engendered in societies across the world, no matter what their size and origins, some form of those phenomena are part of what being a human being is and what being a social human being in a collective is, whether it’s a village, a city or a state.And suddenly along comes someone who basically says actually, you know, you don’t have to believe any of that. You can tell lies, you can just ignore the facts. You can treat people like shit and so on. It’s okay. Appealing to what many of us feel is the dark side of a human being — and which we all have, by the way. I mean, we all have pieces of those in us. And Donald Trump in some extraordinary way was a catalyst for opening up a piece of the collective that is quite dark and potentially, I believe, quite dangerous and counter to the long forces of social progress across the globe. It’s not necessarily Western or Eastern. I think it’s been part of social progress informing sort of the urban planet. And it happened, and here’s what’s extraordinary. What’s truly extraordinary is it happened in less than a year. Now had someone proposed that, had some fancy-schmancy social scientist or economist with Nobel prizes and all the rest proposed that two years earlier, he would have been totally, you know, people would have thought he was a complete idiot. You know, okay, maybe something like that could happen, kind of 1984-ish, yes, but it would take 100 years or 50 years because that’s a whole social progress, but it’s there. The point is it’s potentially always there and Trump found the key to open it. I mean, he’s a cad; it’s not him. It’s there.So, that’s my framework for having hope, because you could imagine an anti-Trump — could be Jesus Christ, could be Mahatma Gandhi, could be Nelson Mandela, who in the hell knows. Buddha. One of these people that have enormous charisma like Mr. Trump, enormous appeal that. instead of appealing to the forces of evil and darkness, appeals to the forces of good, of humanity, of love, appeals to the forces of love, which is in everybody, just as the forces of evil are, and he or she might have the key to ignite that and get us all to realize that, for the collective good, something has to change, and that’s something is to do with no growth, or limited growth, and changing our relationship to our environment. So, that’s my kind of flaky piece of . . . because I lived in California during the ‘60s and ‘70s and I believed all that stuff.Michael Garfield: Well, now, if we’re going to propose that a similar phase transition into the politically possible could happen in the opposite direction, it seems like it would run — and here, again, we’re in this, the rat king or the perfect storm or whatever of this issue, which is that, to the extent that part of scaling was about minimizing the transaction costs in energy and information exchange than we know that — you know, there was a 2014 study outside of SFI. I think it was a Harvard study said that online fake news travels six times faster, than the actual debunking can occur. And, you know, we think about this in brains and it’s like, yeah, you have different layers. You know, like the Daniel Kahneman thing, there’s the reflexive and the instinctive or intuitive. And then there’s the kind of thought that you have to sit and chew on and analyze, and it would seem that a brain or a society needs both. But it seems like the reason that this surprised us, that we were able to transition to a quote-unquote post-truth society fast as we were, was because post-truth media environments don’t — they’re able to move so much faster up to a point, right? Which is the point at which a society that is coordinated on a post-truth narrative that doesn’t empirically align with its actual environment, like, for example, that we can just say, we can innovate our way out of this super exponentially and have infinite economic growth, you know, with finite resources, it’s going to out-compete truth in the short term because it’s more frictionless, right? So we’re back to, I think, when people start asking through the lens of your work questions about, is it even possible to institute a kind of de-growth paradigm on the planet? And it would seem not because we’re cutting against the grain of these economies of scale that provide us the savings that allow for this kind of growth in the first place. Right?Geoffrey West: No, I agree. No, that’s what got me despondent about the whole thing. It goes to what I said earlier; the very dynamic that has given us this extraordinary success, and led us to this place, and that we continue to feed and continue to benefit from, is also the source of our greatest weakness. And it’s hard to see a way out. That’s why I shed my scientific hat and went into a science-fiction-y kind of mode, because you need something dramatic that’s outside of this framework in order for the system to make a dramatic change. And, you know, I hope I’m wrong. I hope this is not the case, but it’s very hard. At the moment it is very hard to see and we feel like lemmings at the moment, running over the edge of a cliff. And the forces, unfortunately, the forces that are trying to counteract it, even within the system, even those that, you know, that we see in terms leadership roles in the system, it’s hard for them to move out of this. I mean, we’re all in it. We all benefit from it. We’re part of it. We engender in some way or another. So it is extremely difficult to see.And, by the way, you’ve reminded me of something else that I didn’t say along the way that is related to this. And that is, one of the things that is very hard for people contemplate, and only during the pandemic, has it begun to sort of penetrate a little bit into social consciousness, is what an exponential means. And I’ve sort of railed about this in the past, but it’s sad that the word exponential, like many words in science, took on a colloquial meaning that only connotes one little bit of it, mainly exponential has come to mean “very fast” in the colloquial language and fine. I mean, the irony is that exponential at the beginnings can be quite slow. It only becomes dangerously fast much later, but, you know, people don’t understand that. And what they usually think exponential means — the system is still sort of linear, basically, but it’s going just very fast linearly. No, this has been an argument since Malthus, that built into an exponential is often collapse. You have to intervene in some way to stop it collapsing. Actually, exponential is a borderline case. It’s super exponential, which is what we’ve been doing, which is the real danger. That is, something that’s even faster than exponential is the real danger, but exponential will do for these purposes. And I do rail against that because people do not understand.One of the things that I was going to write, a short little thing that I was going to try to get published in The New York Times when the pandemic began was that people were using doubling times, which is good. And they were trying to say, look, doubling, it’ll double today. It will be twice as big in five days or whatever. What they should have said is at the beginning, there isn’t a word for it, unfortunately, but going up by a factor of 10, deciling, I don’t know what the word — there isn’t a word. I looked it up. There is no word for increasing by factors of 10. The deciling in the pandemic at the beginning was seven days, which means actually it was about eight days, about a week, which means if it’s a hundred now, in a week’s time, it’s a thousand. A week later, it’s 10,000, a week after that it’s a hundred thousand, in a month it’s a million, and so on. Ten has much more punch than a shitty little doubling. So I was very annoyed that we were still doing it. I still, if I write something, I want to write about that. Because people did not realize, and that’s exponential growth — within, of course, an extremely short time, you have every single person in the country has this bloody thing. And that is part of the problem we’re facing.And one of the problems that is not appreciated, it is, it was, I must say, despite our very poor beginnings to this. And that was because the president and administration took a dim view of the whole thing, and it was part of this lack of belief and lack of belief in science and truth and so on. Eventually, you know, the country got moving and, remarkably, we have saved huge numbers of lives. I mean, obviously had no one intervened and we’d just gone on with our normal business, you know, bodies lying in the street, basically. So we have done it and it’s been a remarkable achievement and we should not poo-poo that, actually, because people in some semi-conscious way sort of got it.What that doubling did mean, what that exponential did mean, was the first inkling. What would be fantastic is if they could realize that, actually — forget about pandemics. That is the world we live in anyway. That’s what’s happening socioeconomically and in terms of the economy anyway. If there’s a doubling time just like that, and it’s going to have the same bloody problem that that pandemic would have had had you not intervened. Everybody would be dead. I mean, actually not everybody. Everybody would have had the disease, I should say. And so it will be, if we don’t do something, that everybody will have the disease of collapse if we don’t do something in the near future. That’s sort of what conclusion I came to.Michael Garfield: Hmm. So, to wrap this, something I talked about with Brian Arthur, again, was the notion of how there’s a link between an economic model and an organism as a kind of hypothesis generated about an environment. And so there’s always something that’s left out of the model. You know, there’s always externalities. So the question that all of this raises for me, and you gesture towards it with this idea of a social or cultural revolution, you know, a paradigm shift, is, what has to be — I’m really setting you up for a fall here. I’m sorry. The question is, what is the current externality? What is not encoded by our cultural quote-unquote genome here that is going to make itself obvious and have to be integrated, and have to be drawn into our understanding of the world, in order for this to not be us trying to move off of a local optimum and go downhill? Like, what is the shift in our perception that’s going to happen for us to realize that endless open growth is not a long-term viability strategy? It seems like it would have to be maybe that we start integrating over longer timespans in our understanding or what?Geoffrey West: Well, I don’t know the answer to that. I mean, I don’t know. The fact is, just to make sure we’re all on the same page here, you know, the work that I’ve been involved in with this, it leaves out obviously lots of stuff. It’s a theory. It’s a model. It has the great advantage that it explains a huge amount of data, enormous amount of data on a very coarse-grained scale. And it predicts various things have been measured, which have been confirmed. So, that’s the way we do science, and what I have been talking about is extrapolating that into the future and saying that, look, the dominant variables in the past are going to continue in the future, such as the structure of our social networks, for example. But, you know, things may change.I don’t put in there, and I don’t know how one would go around modeling it, things I did allude to, like the long-term influence of the internet. Now, as I say, I don’t think it’s going to qualitatively change things. Or the intervention of, you know, some social movement that arises unexpectedly, or an asteroid strikes the planet or whatever. You know, there’s all kinds of things that might be externalities that are outside of everything I’d been talking about, and the purpose of doing this kind of research is, of course, (a) to get a deep mechanistic understanding of the way the world appears. Why is it the way it is? Why are things the way they are? In order for us to avoid problems and mitigate present problems in the future, and to provide a framework and point of departure for thinking about planning for the future. That’s the way science works, I think, in terms of in these areas. It’s very different, by the way, than the the kind of science I spent much of my career doing, which was not coarse-grained, was exactly the opposite — very highly fine-grained, where, you know, you predict things to in some cases many decimal points and do very precise predictions of very precise phenomena. Here we’re making coarse-grained predictions of imprecise phenomena, and that’s the challenge. But two things I want to reemphasize and bring forth — one is it agrees with enormous amounts of data tested in certain various situations, and, most importantly, it’s analytic and it’s quantitative. And I think that’s important.So, I didn’t really answer the question because I don’t know. Because that’s like, you know, the nearest I came to it was my fantasy about the anti-Trump, but you know, that’s going off, that’s not being a scientist. That’s just me reverting to something I may like to think I’d like to be. Fantasize — I don’t do that much. I tend to stay very close to the science.Michael Garfield: Yeah, this this whole book. It’s hilarious how much shade you throw on biologists for not being as rigorous as you would like.Geoffrey West: It’s funny. By the way, I wrote that book with the intention of writing a “popular” book that would have no mathematics, but would try not to bullshit, would really try to explain everything as best I could in English. You know, that was the idea, which was very hard. And I think in some places I felt quite happy and I felt I was successful, but in other places, I’m sure I failed and left things just as obscure.But the point is that I believe passionately in science and in the scientific methodology, and it’s the most powerful way of thinking about the universe man has invented. It has huge areas where it doesn’t apply, probably, that relates to this, actually, you know? What you might call a spiritual life, what you might call our, you know, aspects of irrationality and so forth, and those may play a crucial role in saving us.Michael Garfield: Yeah. So, there are two things that we didn’t get through in this conversation, and I hope that we can, we can get you back soon to get into these other two things. One of which is the detail that you get it to in the afterward about the kind of science that SFI practices and how we hold that in contrast to the kind of science that Chris Anderson famously championed and celebrated with respect to model-free, theory-free machine learning.The other is about the quest for immortality, which is related to finite time singularities and open growth, but links to this beautiful passage that you have about how, for an animal of this size, consuming about 2000 food calories a day, 90 watts, but we’re actually burning 11,000 watts because we’re plugged into these cities. So what is a human being now? Anyway, I know that you’ve got to go!Geoffrey West: I will be back, and I love chatting with you, Michael. I appreciate it. And your patience and tolerance. It was good fun.Michael Garfield: Likewise.Geoffrey West: Good fun. So enjoy the rest of the day.Michael Garfield: Thank you. Thank you, Geoffrey.
36,Episode Details / Transcript LAURENCE GONZALES: I’ve made recordings in the past. I don't know if you know, I used to be a musician.MICHAEL GARFIELD: No.LAURENCE GONZALES: Yeah. Right out of college. I grew up with my father as a scientist and everybody expected me to follow in his footsteps and become a scientist. I literally grew up in medical school when he taught in medical school. And then I got to college, this was while I was a kid, mind you, and into high school, and between high school and college, when I was 17, I was the only electron microscopist in Chicago that was available for hire because they had all been spoken for. My dad had taught me electron microscopy from the time I was about 11 till 17. And so, I was hired because there was a shortage of these technicians. I was hired by Children's Memorial Hospital to run their electron-microscopy department. It was very bizarre. And I did. I did. I ran it for the whole summer, you know, processing specimens for the doctors who were doing research there. And then I ran away with a rock and roll band and I spent several years touring all over the country with it. It was actually a rhythm and blues kind of band, like Otis Redding type stuff. And, you know, it was a fun thing for a kid to do. But after a couple of years, I realized that I don't want to stay in a motel with my nine closest friends. That's no fun.MICHAEL GARFIELD: So, you became a stunt pilot then, is that right?LAURENCE GONZALES: No, not right at that moment. Although I became a pilot just as quick as I could arrange it. I went back to Northwestern, went to school, realizing that I wanted to be a writer. And I didn't stay very long, I never got a college degree. It was just too slow for me. I didn't find it to be a good pace. I mean, to take months and months to learn the things that they learned seemed a frivolous waste of time. So, I went off on my own as a writer. And when I started flying stunt planes – that was probably in the nineties, it was probably 1990 – I flew stunt, and I flew aerobatics for about eight years until enough of my friends had gotten killed that I realized that I was going to get killed unless I stopped. So, I stopped.MICHAEL GARFIELD: It takes an unusual amount of self-awareness. I think a lot of people see it and don't care. I know that that's very common among mountain climbers, that they hold the funeral and then they go out and they're hitting the cliffs the next day, you know?LAURENCE GONZALES: Well, it's true. And I see this in our present situation with this pandemic going on, just I see behavior that is stupid. But you don't have to be stupid to do stupid things. And that's the central theme of my research over the last 25 years, I would say, is why smart people do stupid things.MICHAEL GARFIELD: So that's a great place to jump into this. I really want to focus on Surviving Survival for this call, because I feel like this particular book and its lessons on the neuroscience of how we cope with trauma are really perennial, but they're timely. It’s very clear that these insights are deeply important insights to be sharing right now, as we grapple with the economic and the public health and the social unrest impacts of this mess. And then the looming crises that are sort of saddled on top of that. I know this book grew out of a career length interest in survival, but I'd love to know sort of the origins of this particular workLAURENCE GONZALES: Well, I wrote Deep Survival and the way that I structured deep survival was that each episode was used to illustrate a particular point, a point of science, or psychology, or something like that. And the stories of these people were told so that they came to an end at the point of the rescue. So, if you're shipwrecked at sea, the story is told until the rescue and then that story ends. And afterwards, I became acutely aware through a variety of sources – not the least of which were the readers of Deep Survival who contacted me – and I became aware of what I should have known initially, which is that that's not where the story ends. That is where a whole new story begins. And in fact, it’s a very interesting story, maybe even more interesting than the first, because it takes a person who has established a life and a mind and an emotional system and forces this person into a completely new set of rules, a new set-up of environmental cues, behaviors, and so forth.So, one of the things I was trying to get across to people in Surviving Survival is that once the crisis is over, the immediate impulse is, “Let's go back to the way things were before.” You know? Let's say that you're a soldier and you go to war and your crisis is war. You come home to your wife and family and you think, well, “Let's just pick up where I left off.” And it turns out to be impossible. So, what are the rules? What are the constraints? What are the boundary conditions, and how to approach this problem became the quest of Surviving Survival. And, I think we're all facing this right now. We're going to face it even more when the pandemic is really over. When we try to go back to regular life, it's going to be different, and we don't yet know how it's going to be different.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah, that's one of the things I really like that you emphasize in this book, is the model of the brain as an organ of prediction. And then how trauma challenges the mental models that we create, including models of the self: the way that the brain and the body are linked. Especially in the numerous cases you're given this book where someone has been physically altered through a bear attack, or an IED, where they've lost parts of themselves and their mental model of their own body no longer fits the model that they have. And the model of the world has been challenged by rare but intense events that the brain has now latched onto and decided are frequent events, because of their intensity. There's that whole evolutionary psychology around “rare but awful” events, and that we give special emphasis to these events when they happen.So, you've got a great sense for the pithy encapsulation, the efficiently encoded point. You put it two different ways. One is, we don't get over it, we get on with it. And then another is that we live on, but we also live with. So, I'd love to hear you talk a little bit about this particular thing, because inside of it is this whole profound lesson about (1) what the brain is and how trauma is actually a functioning brain. And then (2) how the things that we take for granted about our human nature and our cultural existence are ways that we have adapted to the anxiety-inducing conditions of our world.LAURENCE GONZALES: Well, to begin with, I will say that the thing that we call PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) is not in my view, a “disorder,” and it shouldn't be called that. It is the normal working of the brain. And I say “brain” with a caveat, which is that most neuroscientists and cognitive scientists no longer believe that the brain is this great operating system that runs everything. The brain is part of the body. And the body actually has more to say to the brain than the brain says to the body. So, if you look at the vagus nerve connections coming from the base of the brain, about 20% of the information goes from brain to body, but about 80% goes from body to brain. And this is a very interesting conversation that's going on, because we don't know what it's saying, but we do know that the body is constantly speaking to the brain.So, when I say “brain,” you have to have a revised view of that. It's the body/brain complex, which is too much of a mouthful to say, but we do have concepts such as memory, for example, that we associate with the brain. You know, we look at places in the brain like the hippocampus and say, “Oh yeah, well that makes memories well,” but the body makes memories, too. And so being intimately involved with the body is something to keep in mind. When we talk about this, it is believed now by most neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, people like David Krakauer’s brother, John, at Johns Hopkins, that the brain remembers everything. So, there's a little slice of our memory that we have conscious access to. And I believe, and John and other scientists believe, that it's a small slice, but that elsewhere stored somehow is a lot of other stuff that we're not even aware of most of the time.  And, it's probably the most important stuff that's going on…It will do things for us constantly like solve problems. Any scientist will tell you, any artist will tell you, “I've been working on a problem for a long, long time and I couldn't figure it out. And finally, I went to Hawaii and lay on the beach and the answer came to me.” And this is the part that Cormac McCarthy calls the night shift, a term that George Zweig invented, which is what goes on under the surface. So that's a kind of, long-winded preface to say that when we’ve experienced trauma, the brain encodes everything about that situation. And so, in the case of one lady in the book Surviving Survival who was attacked by a bear, just before the attack, she sat down with her husband to take a little rest and she had crumbled up some pine needles to smell, because she always liked the smell of pine. After the attack, she went home and discovered that the smell of pine would send her into an immediate anxiety attack, a panic attack. So, something that had been labeled by her as good, through trauma got labeled by her as bad. And she had no control over it. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't appeal to our will to change. It just is. It's like a scar.So, when I talk about getting on with it, as opposed to getting over it, I mean that sort of thing: that we have to learn to adapt, and not everyone can. In the case of a lady I wrote about who was attacked by a shark, she lost the use of her right hand. She didn't actually lose the whole hand, but lost the use of it. And the many things that she liked to do in life, from cooking to shooting pistols, became very difficult for her. She devised all kinds of workarounds to make this work for her. And in fact, became very capable in the face of the loss of her hand. So, she was getting on with it, but she didn't get over it. She didn't get a new hand. And most of us, when we’ve experienced trauma – and we all will experience some level of trauma. It's very rare to go through life, through childhood and adulthood, not having experienced trauma – but most of us will have some kind of coping mechanism like this. There's a whole other system, and if you'd like I can talk about it, that mediates this process of upset and regaining balance. It's pretty interesting stuff…MICHAEL GARFIELD: Before we go there, I want to dig a little into the rest of the iceberg that we take for granted, you know, like in Vedanta. I've heard it talked about as the rider and the elephant, that is that you trust the elephant, you trust the wisdom of your body, and you give a couple of really great examples. One is research that David Eagleman has done on chick-sorting, and how there is this implicit knowledge that people have –  they don't know how they know the difference between a male and a female chick – but it's something that is patterned into the body through experience. And that we have all of these different forms of kinesthetic intelligence. You know, it was a real eyeopener for me reading this book because I have made a point in my life to develop faculties that I have always called intuitive faculties. But, you've laid out for me that this is not some sort of abstract woo, kind of spiritual thing, but that this is about sub-threshold kinesthetic, encoding of knowledge and experience in the body.  I'd like to hear you connect that piece of it, to this other piece of it. You talk about how, when people get lost in the woods or when they've experienced a traumatic blow or something, that this “self” that has all of these different layers to it, many of which we're not aware of, that they can fragment and that people end up talking to animals, or they're visited by the apparitions of dead loved ones. Aron Ralston trapped under the boulder sees a vision of his future child. And so, there's another piece which is like the secular ghost that I find really interesting here.LAURENCE GONZALES: Yeah, so think about us as humans, half a million years ago, or even Australopithecines three or 4 million years ago. At some point in this continuum of developing through evolution, we begin to have what we call conscious, literal, rational awareness. And I could imagine this having to do with tools, or something like that. But before that, you have an animal consciousness in which the animal is doing everything it needs to do by way of the system you're talking about. And again, George Zweig coined the term “the night shift” because it happens overnight in your brain/body, not necessarily at night, but it's a nice term, it's the unconscious processing. And we know almost nothing about it. We know nothing about it. Let me put it that way.  We just know it happens. It happens reliably. It does all kinds of things for us. And it operates us all the time.Most of what we do, and every neuroscientist will tell you this today, most of what we do arises from unconscious impulses. And in fact, studies of the lower parts of the brain seem to suggest that these lower parts are constantly suggesting actions for us that we veto. And that, if you have Tourette syndrome, for example, you're failing to veto those things, and you do things like throw your coffee cup at the refrigerator and curse out loud in public. But anyway, this whole subterranean system of directing is the norm and the newer, much newer, conscious, rational deciding thing is just a very thin bandwidth that we have to work with in managing this other thing or trying to, or trying to imagine what it wants from us, or trying to override it. And so this is constantly helping our lives and interfering with our lives.MICHAEL GARFIELD: When I had David Krakauer on…we discussed this in a few episodes of the Transmission series, about when we’ve experienced a massive disruption to our collective understanding, you know, the implicit models that we take for granted, as the coronavirus has done to us. We were discussing Simon DeDeo’s contribution to the Transmission series, and Melanie Mitchell's, and how both of them make this case that we're kind of babes in the woods with this, having to sort of reconstitute the frames that we take for granted here. This seems associated with a loss of effective leadership at many different scales, and in many different sectors of society.And, you know, when you talk about the veto being a relatively tenuous and recent thing, what we're also talking about, I think, is the difficulty that we've had in coordinating an effective response to this pandemic. Or to guide our way through all of the racial justice conversations in a way…I hear a lot of people talk about how we've sort of lost the political will to keep corporations in check, this kind of thing. I see that operating at both the level of the individual, as well as the level of the collective right now.LAURENCE GONZALES: I mean, let's not forget, I think I point this out in Deep Survival, that the way that we live in the United States and Europe, and so-called first world countries is like we're domestic animals. So, that’s part of my impulse for writing about survival. If you have a dog that you keep inside all the time and take for little walks and feed him two or three times a day, you've got a dog who's not going to do very well, if you throw him out in the forest, you know? Throw him into the Grand Teton National park or someplace like that, he won't know what to do. He's never learned to hunt. He’s not used to predators. And we're like that, people, you know? I wake up in the morning, my coffee machine goes off and feeds me a cup of coffee, and there's a meal ready, and people deliver groceries to the door.  And if I'm bored, I turn on YouTube or TV. It's just endless rewards.Now, if you have a dog, you know that the way you train a dog is with rewards. So, you put some treats in your left-hand pocket, and the dog puts his nose up to your pocket, and you give him one every once in a while, you got a dog that heels all of a sudden. So, you know, what is my behavior? Am I responding to rewards with logical behavior? No, no I'm not. I'm just going about my life, doing whatever I want. Anything I want, I can do. And as a journalist, all my life, I've gotten to do all kinds of wonderful things, just because I wanted to do them and then write about them and get paid for writing. So, I have this amazing life and I get these rewards.And what are the rewards telling me? It's like, “Wow, this works! All I have to do is heel, and I get all these treats.” Well, when you're put in a position of power and that is your attitude, you're in a very dangerous position: dangerous for you, dangerous for all of us, because you think you've always been right. And moreover, you want the treats to keep coming. And so ll of this leads you into a really bad decision space. And, this has nothing to do with what party you're affiliated with, or what you believe in. It's just a fact, an animal fact of life.In my view, if you occupy a public office, you should be stripped of all of your possessions and wear, like, a robe or something. You should have nothing, and you should be allowed to have nothing, and your decision-making will become purer because you'll have to actually work for your rewards. That's, I suppose a radical, view.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Well, that's like Jerry Brown, right? Sleeping on the floor…LAURENCE GONZALES: Yeah, but I mean, I think what we're seeing is very natural animal reaction, like Memorial Day. So, on Memorial Day, everybody went crazy, they said, “Okay, I'm sick of this. I'm all done. I’m all done with pandemics. I'm going back to the beach to have a barbecue.” And everybody's getting sick, now. It’s been about four or five weeks…just about ripe for an explosion. And people do that because they're not trained, they've had no training in what survival means, they've had no training in patience, they've had no training in even understanding what the heck a virus is, and how extremely dangerous it is.So right now, for a guy like me – I'm 72 years old and I have lung damage from when I covered the World Trade Center collapse, breathing all that stuff that was floating around in the air – so I am extremely vulnerable to this pandemic. And in talking to my family about how I expect to behave, I say, “this is free solo climbing. You slip, you die,” you know? “This is without ropes.” I cannot get it and say, “Oh, I want to do over. I'll be more careful next time.” There won't be a next time. And people just don't get that, because they've never been trained to get that.MICHAEL GARFIELD: So, in bringing up the domestic animal piece, something that I've been reflecting on a lot in this extra-long quarantine phase, has been this walk that I took my friend's dog on a few years ago through a very nice neighborhood. And every house we passed, a dog was jumping up at the window, you know, like, “Let me out!” And this sense that we have boxed up these creatures that we love with very sensitive nervous systems in areas where there's all this…for us as humans, subsonic noise, pollution, the refrigerators and the air conditioners. Or if you're in a tall building, the frequency of the building swaying in the breeze has been known to like drive certain pets insane. And here we are. We've reproduced the conditions, the crazy-making conditions, that we've been subjecting our animal familiars to all these years.So that's one side of the catch-22 that we're in. The other side is the one that you just mentioned, which is that if we buck against the leash and run off into the woods, then we're running off into a situation for which we are unprepared. Later in this book, you look at this…this is sort of a slant rhyme to the issue that you just mentioned, but the issue of why people dealing with post-traumatic stress isolate themselves in the woods. Or historically, people who would escape the plague in a monastery would become monks in order to escape these conditions. That in pre-history, we're dealing with these Dunbar number and sub-Dunbar number groups, families nested into clans. And you have a kind of reasonably self-sorted group of people with whom everyone's life depends on everyone else’s.  So, you're highly incentivized to agree in a way that we don't have in the city.I know you know, David Krakauer’s riff that he brought up in the first episode of the show, his landscape of science, the mountain: where you go off alone for the insight, you have the vision and you take it down into the monastery to play with friends, test it out. That's where SFI is, the science monastery. And then you bring it into the metropolis, in its marketplace and you test it against the third party. But as you point out in Surviving Survival, the problem is that our mirror neurons are tuned for these much smaller groups. We are so sensitive to one another, that a lot of people cannot return to their life in this city. That emotionally it's impossible. They can't go out to a restaurant anymore.So, I was thinking about that, you know, and talking with Geoff West. How do we continue to reap the benefits of a metropolitan existence, the wealth and the innovation, but in a way that does not amplify our vulnerability to the social hazards? And, it seems increasingly obvious that one of the social hazards that we're already experiencing, and that we were experiencing even before the situation, was that we have basically cut open and exposed a raw nerve here with one another. You know, the 24-hour news cycle and social media…That we are sharing a mind now in a way that we didn't use to, and at a scale that we didn't use to. And this sort of presents its own whole set of complicating problems with respect to the traumas that we're going to be coping with in the years to come.LAURENCE GONZALES: So I'm going to direct this conversation to a place where those things converge and make sense. When David Krakauer and I talked recently, we were talking about the fact that the pandemic, the economic collapse, and the social violence that's taken place were all part of the same complex system, and that it works a little bit like this: So, the pandemic, which he suggested I not say that Santa Fe Institute predicted it, but in reading over the past literature, the symposia and all that, since 1987, SFI has been studying epidemics and the immune system…they might as well at predicted it. But whatever!But it did happen. We knew it was going to happen.  And when it finally happened, everybody got hit in the head, essentially. You lose your job. You'd have to stay at home. You can't go to the grocery store. You can't get your hair cut, whatever. All of these different things impinged upon our domesticated animal way of life that we talked about. Suddenly we were domestic animals in the pound and we didn't like it, and we wanted to be back home in the comfortable living room where we're used to. So that went on for a couple of months and we got more and more up with it, priming our emotional systems – And everybody's familiar with emotional priming: you know, you're cooking dinner with your wife and you cut your finger while chopping onions. You're much more likely to yell at your wife if she annoys you, than if you didn't cut your finger – So all of a sudden, we're all emotionally primed, we're fed up, we're tired, sick and tired, pissed off.And this thing with the policemen murdering George Floyd happens, and it's like, “Okay, that's the last straw! I'm going to break some windows now.” And the whole country went up in flames. So, this is all of a piece. This is all of a piece. This is all one big complex, interwoven, tightly connected system, and we were seeing the different kinds of eruptions and outcomes from it. But to understand it as a system, and not just isolated things is the important point that David was making. And at this point, I just want to step back and talk about emotional priming so that we all understand what it is, since this is also the basis of PTS, as we'll call it, post-traumatic stress. And it goes back to what we started with, which is memory.So, we're all familiar with what happens when you step on a cat's tail. Step on the cat's tail and the cat screams, it's claws come out, it's a jaw tightens, all these chemical changes go on inside of it. It's in a fight or flight reaction, that's very powerful. All mammals have this. And the scientists who study it refer to the part of the brain that's involved in this as the “rage circuit.” Not every neuroscientist likes the idea of a circuit, but nevertheless, it's a pathway in the brain that goes through identifiable areas that we can give names to, like the tegmentum gray area, and so forth. This is known, and it's easy to demonstrate. The cat has another behavior that we're familiar with, which is stalking behavior. And when it's stalking, it has to be very quiet, it has to be methodical, goal-oriented, usually rhythmic in nature. This gets it to get to the prey, and it can't have the “rage circuit” going off in the middle of this, or it will never catching anything. As a biological fact, these two circuits cross each other, so if you're using one of them, you can't use the other one. So when you're in the race, you can't do stalking because you're too distracted. And the stalking circuit – they call the “seeking circuit” – when you're using that, you can't be in a rage.Well, this is a very convenient thing for people, because people are clever and they find ways to activate the seeking circuit, if they've been traumatized and their rage circuit is going off all the time and making their lives miserable. So, this doesn't happen to everyone, but it happens to a lot of people. Once you get traumatized – and this is part of priming – I irritate you enough to where that rage circuit is going off all the time. And this can happen in a million different ways, as we know: anything from war, child abuse, you know, there's all kinds of ways to do that. You'll go off, you have a hair trigger, panic or anger or some kind of response like that, but you will find something to help you with that. Most people will find something. Maybe you discover when you play my guitar, you really feel calm. I like playing guitar. It makes me feel good. So, after a while you discover you're playing guitar 12 hours a day, and guess what? You become really good at it. “Michael, he's a genius! Have you ever heard him play guitar? It's unbelievable.”  And meanwhile, you're miserable unless you're playing guitar.This is the same thing. You look at the career of famous people like Glenn Gould, Pablo Picasso, Newton. Newton was a total mess and spent every waking minute and many of his sleeping minutes working on his stuff, and it made him a genius, you know? He worked night and day on this stuff. So, it's a very common thing. Not all of us become geniuses, but many of us become obsessed with what makes us feel good. Something like that is going on in all of us. And, and in these times in particular, we need to find it.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Indeed. Yeah, this was such an eye-opening part of your book for me because it links the trauma with a super power. You know, when you think about the origins of superheroes and…it was about a month or two ago that I started realizing that the confinement that we're undergoing is bringing out people's innate awesomeness in interesting ways, not everybody. And you, you do a really good job in this book of differentiating what it takes to be made, to be tempered like a sword under these conditions, rather than broken. But so many people are stepping into themselves in a way now through physical patterned, repetitive, organized, directed towards a goal…you list it on page 109. And you give, like you mentioned a few moments ago, some guesses into human prehistory here: that maybe people were so preoccupied with the manufacture of stone tools as a way of coping with the anxiety of our vulnerability in prehistory, that ritual and the early forms of religion may have emerged in an adaptive response to those conditions.And then I loved that you turn it on yourself, and you talk about your own writing as an instance of this. Because, one of the things that is a very, very clear pattern that Richard Doyle, English professor at Penn State University pointed out in his book Darwin's Pharmacy, was that this is ubiquitous among psychedelic trip reports. That it's page after page of, I believe he called it “hypergraphic claims to ineffability,” that people are confronted with this experience that is on one level traumatic: it's a radical reformulation of subjectivity. And the only way that most people through history…he actually proposes this is where modern language came from, it was an attempt to grapple with these bizarre experiences. So, I was just like, “Oh wow, I get it now.” Like, I understand me and my brother and all of these other people who are locked into these ultimately amazing, but nonetheless compulsive, and kind of screwy patterns of repetitive creative, goal-directed behavior.LAURENCE GONZALES: Well, when, my father came back from world war two in 1945 – I was not yet born, but I was born soon after I was born in 47– he was still recuperating from his wounds and trying to get a PhD in biophysics. So, he was a busy, distracted guy, but I was very acutely aware, even as a little kid, I can remember seeing his shins and feet, which had been broken in his plane crash when he was shot down, and being very impressed by how injured he was. But he also typed a lot because he was doing his thesis and all that for his PhD, and he had an old typewriter on his desk that he used manual typewriter. He was pretty good typist. And I was fascinated by the typewriter. I really wanted to type and he would let me type, I didn't know how to type, I didn't know how to read.  And then, I mentioned earlier that I grew up in the medical school with him, where he taught me and I would get to type there and I would use a manual typewriter, but then I would see the secretaries had electric typewriters and it was like, “Oh man, an electric guitar!” So when I went to work at Children's Memorial Hospital, running the electron microscopy department there when I was 17, my first paycheck went to buy me a typewriter, an electric typewriter…a Corona. It wasn't very expensive, but it was a lot of money for me at the time. And I immediately learned to type correctly, and I typed for the rest of my life. I'm still doing it. So, when people say to me, “Oh, you're a writer.” I say, “No, not really, I'm a typist.”And I don't know where the words come from, but they come from the night shift. I know that now. So, when I was writing Deep Survival and Surviving Survival, which is the sequel to Deep Survival, I would sit down in the morning, early morning, usually five o'clock or so, and I would start typing and I wouldn't look up until my wife would say, “Don't you want lunch?” And I'd be like, “Oh, it's noon already?!” She took good care of me, she would make me lunch and I'd look at what I'd written, and I’d think, “Where did that come from? I mean, I don't remember thinking of those words. I just know that I was typing.” And so, this whole process literally took place out of reach of consciousness. And I remember distinctly this feeling coming over me, when I was writing the last chapter of Deep Survival. And I said, “I am going to blow their minds. Now I'm going to sit down. I'm going to make my mind a blank, and I'm going to blow their minds. I don't know what it will be, but here we go.” And I just typed it.MICHAEL GARFIELD: It worked.LAURENCE GONZALES: And it worked. It, to me, is the most interesting part of humanity. And going back to what you said about coping with trauma, I never had any discipline, I was just coping with trauma. It made me feel good to type. So, I have no doubt that, you know, 300,000 years ago, some human being who was traumatized in some way was sitting down there, flaking rocks because it felt good. And that's how many tools got made. And that's how many more tools than were needed got made. That's an interesting logical finding, by the way, that they’ve discovered communities where they were like millions of knives. And it's like, how could the small group of people have needed all these knives? Well, they didn't, they just made them.MICHAEL GARFIELD: It was prehistoric e-waste, right? So, to that point, and with a nod to SFI trustee, Josh Wolfe – because Lux Capital, his firm, invests in advanced technologies, and he's written some really interesting pieces on Medium about his understanding, informed by SFI science, about the trajectory of technological innovation. And, you know, one of the things that he talks about is how technology is getting more and more intimate with the human body. It used to be something you hold at arm’s length. Now it's something that you're carrying in your pocket. Now it's becoming something that we wear all the time. We're already looking at implantables, if things continue as they have been, that's going to be normal in the years to come. And, you know, I've been thinking about this. I think I sent you one of my own recent drafts recently about my experience with wearable computing and Google Glass, and how Google just decided all of a sudden that they were going to stop mirroring the software for Glass. And they cut off this community of thousands of people wearing this thing, who…when I started wearing Google Glass, I was dreaming about wearing it within a week. It became a part of my body image and the homunculus.LAURENCE GONZALES: Are you familiar with the Tetris experiments?MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah, You talk about that a little bit in the book, but unpack that for people.LAURENCE GONZALES: I can't remember who did it now, but essentially, you take people who have lost all short term memory through brain damage and teach them to play Tetris. And then after a little while they'll learn very easily how to play Tetris, which is a game, if you don't know. It's little geometric pieces that fall on a computer screen and you have to turn them to orient them so they fit correctly. And then if you mess it up, it blows up and you have to start over. So, these people who had no short term memory would learn Tetris easily. They would come into the lab the next day and have no idea what you were talking about, and when you said, “Let's play Tetris,” but if they put their hand on the keyboard, they'd know exactly what to do. So, this was again, operating out of the night shift, this invisible part of us, they would start to dream about Tetris within a few days and improve at it over time. There's this whole memory system that exists in which you embody things. And there are many, many examples of this, but what you're talking about is this embodied memory system.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah. So, Jaron Lanier, who was a founding figure in virtual reality now works at Microsoft on the HoloLens, he talked about the plasticity of the body image as a feature that we could explore for educational purposes in virtual reality. And you know, my experience with Glass and then suddenly losing this part of my body because…LAURENCE GONZALES: They cut you all off?MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah, they just immediately stopped mirroring the app, and the final update to the device had like one 10th of the functionality that it used to. Admittedly, I'm not somebody…as you are aware of and reflect on in your book, I've had trauma. Everyone is coping with some degree of trauma. And I don't mean to magnify this issue. It's certainly a lot less than divorce or cross-country moves or the loss of love or any of these things, but nonetheless, this experience forced me into reflection on our increasing interdependency with technologies. And, you know, David Krakauer has talked a lot about this in terms of de-cephalization in the evolutionary process. That as we scaffold ourselves more and more with environmental processes, our own cognition becomes more and more vestigial. I began to be really concerned.I hope that Josh Wolfe is listening to this, and is thinking about the cognitive and ethical issues of wearable technologies, because you know, someone else whose trauma informed an insane career in hypergraphia was Phillip K Dick. And in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, that book starts with the mood organ, which is like the alarm clock that Rick Deckard, his wife is using to regulate her own emotional state. And he's arguing about why she's choosing to be sad. But we have these technologies, now. We have wearables that regulate through vibration, your parasympathetic nervous system. And the question for me is, are we digging ourselves into a hole we're going to have a hard time climbing out of. If we become more and more dependent on technologies that…as we've seen through the way that the pandemic has disrupted our food supply chains and so on, that are based on brittle systems that are regulated externally. So, this is like, this is where I think I'd like to bridge to the conversation that you have towards the end of this book, about the internal and the external locus of control, and how important it is to reclaim our sovereignty. Which, in the case of wearables, might look like owning your own data or having agency over your own software, but more broadly, it's this issue of how we deal with trauma, and how do we find wholeness?LAURENCE GONZALES: Psychologists use this term “locus of control,” and we're all familiar with what I call the whiner. This is a person who is always complaining, always blaming others for things that happen to the person, and these people take on a kind of attitude of helplessness, that the world is victimizing them, and indeed they live like victims. And this is called an external locus of control. It means you view your life as something that shit is happening to. The internal locus of control is pretty much the outburst. It's, when something bad happens, say you trip on the sidewalk, you don't say, “I'm going to sue those guys.” You say, “Wow, I better be more careful and watch where I'm going.” And so, your knee jerk reaction is to take on the responsibility yourself, to blame yourself for things and not make the blame pathological, but make it be inspirational.  So that you say,”I've got an idea, I'm going to do this, this and this,” and you change your behavior.And these are adaptations that are very good for survival. They're very good in situations such as this pandemic, where in the case of me and my wife, we have to stay home, pretty much. We can't go out socializing. We don't go to the grocery store. Other people do that for us. And we're making creative use of the time, not like, “Oh my God, this terrible thing is happening. I'm so bored,” but like, “Wow, I always wanted to learn German, let’s do something about it.” And so, it's one of the things I say in both Deep Survival and Surviving Survival, is that survivors – and in both cases, that's what you need to be – take adversity and turn it into opportunity. So when something bad happens, that means something new has happened because this thing has not happened before.  And it's an interesting learning opportunity. How exactly did we get here? What can I do with it?I looked at my 401k when the stock market was crashing in March and it was like getting beaten up like a red-headed stepchild. I'm part Irish, too, by the way. I went out and I bought some stocks, because they were like basement bargain, cheap. You know, I bought things that I knew would bounce right back like Amazon. I got Amazon in March for like 1700 a share and it's now 2,700 a share. So, there was adversity. I was looking at my retirement fund and going, “Oh my God, I'm going to pull my hair out,” and on the other hand, I said, “Wow, this is really cool. I'm going to get some more.” So, you know, that's just one example. That's a trivial example. But in all of our doing and thinking, we can be constantly saying, you know, what can I do with this? How is this useful? And, moreover, how can I help? Because if you're helping someone else, one of the things I say in Surviving Survival is find somebody who's worse off than you are, and help that person because then suddenly you're a rescuer, you're not a victim anymore. So, I think these are all important things for our time.MICHAEL GARFIELD: That brings me to the last issue that I wanted to touch on with you for this call, which is that issue of service that you just highlighted, and how it relates to use of travel as a way of recovering, as a way of coping, and getting on with and living with trauma. You identify that, like you said, with rage versus stalking pathways, that curiosity and fear are kind of mutually incompatible, and that to follow curiosity, to recognize opportunity, to pay attention, to be vigilant, but in a sort of focused, open, beginner's mind kind of way, leads us out of the fetal position that were curled up in, and out into the world, in what for many people who have survived really horrible life experiences becomes a life path of service, of teaching, or of social work. So again, I'm thinking about this on the social scale that we're on and there's sort of the childish level at which everyone's like, “Oh, as soon as this is over, it's going to be the resurrection of the great American road trip.”  But on a bigger level, there is this question of right before the pandemic, it seemed like we may never find the solidarity as a species that we experienced in the moments of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. And like, here we have now lived through something traumatic together, and we're going to be in a position where we have to turn our attention out of the cave and into the cosmos and ask ourselves, “How do we stay curious, and how do we explore in a way that allows us to live with what we've just undergone?” And I, that, for me, that really speaks to what SFI has been communicating with the InterPlanetary Festival. It gives us a sound moral and empirical founding upon which we may be able to reconstruct a concerted global effort at space exploration. Or at least, a restoration of travel in a way that is, for lack of a better word, more spiritually attuned than the kind of predatory tourism that we were slipping into before all of this.LAURENCE GONZALES: Well, I think that one of the key qualities of a survivor is curiosity, because the system of memory that we bear that runs everything that I talked about earlier works like this. We see something, and we very quickly make a mental model of it, which is a kind of prototype. So, I have a one-year-old granddaughter and the first time she saw a dog, somebody said “doggy.” And the second time she saw a dog, somebody said “doggy.” And the third time she saw a dog, she tried to say “doggy”. She knew exactly what it was. She had created a sort of prototypical dog, an er-dog of some kind in her brain. And we believe this happens in the hippocampus, but in any event from that moment on, through the rest of her life, she'll never mistake a dog for anything else. She'll never mistake a goat for a dog.  And moreover, dogs look so different. I mean, from a Chihuahua to a Great Dane, to a Lhasa Apso, it's a miracle that she can do this and create what I call a mental model.Well, we do that with everything, everything in our world is made up of mental models. Eventually, unless we see something we've never seen before. And because it makes us so much more efficient, our brain/body system likes these mental models, and it doesn't want you to see the world. It wants you to see the model. Then we take these models and we do things with them. So we learned, for example, to tie our shoes, and we learn even to drive a car unconsciously, automatically. If we play tennis, the tennis serve is automatic. We can't think through it. If we think through it, we'll mess it up. It takes place explosively and automatically, most of our behavior is of that type.  And if you do something enough, it'll become automatic.And I think you and David talked about that habitual behavior before on this program. It’s something that's made us very efficient. If you were the guy who could see the single stripe through the bushes and know that it was a tiger, you could run away and carry your DNA to the next generation. On the other hand, in our modern lives, it's not always helpful.The guy who is curious and who jumps over this process and says, “Hey, what's going on? Maybe I don't know,” because the system is designed to tell you, you know what? You don't need any more information. You don't have to study this problem anymore, you know, automatically to do, go ahead and do it. That leads to accidents. It leads to mistakes. You know, when I talk about this stuff in keynote speeches or something, I often begin by saying, “Raise your hand, if you have ever known someone who has made a really bad decision about a love relationship.” And of course, if you're over 13, you raise your hand, right? Because you do know someone, and maybe it's you. So how do you make those decisions? Well, you don't make them by calling your lawyer and saying, “Hey, I met this girl. What do you think?” You make them through the night shift. You make them automatically. And so goes the rest of the world. And only by being curious are you going to interrupt things and say, “Maybe I don't really know enough to act. Maybe I should learn more about the situation I'm in.”And I see this in simple things, very simple things out on the street. People wearing masks, who don't recognize that you have different holes in your face that are avenues for pathogens to get in.  You've got two eyes, two nostrils and a mouth. And if you're going to cover up, you better cover them all. So, you need to cover your nose as well as your mouth. And you need to put on goggles or a face shield if you want to cover your eyes. I mean, I see this on a TV. I see supposed experts with their mask over their mouth, but not over their nose, and I think, “What are they thinking? I don't want to listen to this guy. He doesn't know what he's talking about.”MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah. As someone with a lot of Jewish blood in me. I tend to think of the moment that we're in right now as sort of the Exodus, it’s like the beginning of our 40 years of wandering. They talk about this, it's like the so-called promised land was only a few miles away. And yet somehow, they ended up like wandering in these canyonlands for 40 years. Like, what was that? And arguably, you know, if we're talking about what you just said, it might have been just a maladaptive thing. But then again, there's also recent research on the random walk in search for foraging animals, and how you watch the basking shark. Then it takes a levy flight. You know, if there's no external stimulus to guide it in a directed hunt, then it just sort of moves through the space randomly. And I look at your chapter on travel, which I found deeply inspiring, and I think, maybe that's what we have prescribed for us right now is that without clear guidance, without an operable set of models that we can fit to the novel reality that we're now inhabiting, that what this takes is an open, random walk through the space of possibility until the lava cools and it becomes something that we can stand on.LAURENCE GONZALES: Well, one of the things that I've been doing – speaking of how to fill this time, and of course I can fill it writing, but I can't write 24 hours a day – is just picking up books that I've had for a long time and never read and seeing, you know, what is, what is in this book anyway. And it can be anything from a novel to a scientific book, to a historical book, to a biography. Just by following my own theory, which is not mine, but the theory of the night shift that I've talked about, you don't know what you put in there that's going to be helpful. And so, this is another way in which curiosity is important, because if you're very narrow – and this is a definitely an SFI concept – if you're very narrow, there are a lot of things you won't think of.And so, to get back to my father, he taught me that everything is interesting. There's no such thing as a boring thing. And so here is a rock on my desk, what's so interesting about that? And then I look at a book on my bookshelf and there's a thousand-page book by John McPhee about geology. That's essentially the story of this rock. How can you write a thousand-page book about a rock? Well, he did. And it's quite a page-turner, too. It’s called Annals of the Former World. I highly recommend it, do you know it?MICHAEL GARFIELD: No, but I was trained in paleontology, so I can sympathize.LAURENCE GONZALES: It's an indication of, like, ok, I'm going to put all this geology in my brain. I have no idea what use it's going to be. But somewhere along the line in the night shift, in the constant processing of information, it may lead to something that pops out when I want it. And it's a miracle. And so, I think this is a very important concept for people to bind to their souls with hoops of steel.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Excellent. Well, Laurence, do you have any parting thoughts for us before we wrap this? It's been awesome talking to you.LAURENCE GONZALES: Thank you. I enjoyed talking to you.  You too. Well, my thought is to be aware. I mean, some people call it mindfulness, but to just be aware. And it's hard to be aware, because of the memory system I talked about that makes everything automatic. You know, we make mental models and we forget what everything looks like. And we make what I call behavioral scripts, automatic actions. And we forget why and how we're doing things. All you have to do is slow down and really pay attention to see, well, there is this thing on my desk and it is a key. What is it the key to? why do I have this? And then to realize that there's a mechanism that's turned by this key.  “Wow, let me look inside this clock and see how it works.” You know? It leads down a path. To be curious, leads you down a path.  I was once exploring caves in Custer State Park in the Black Hills. I was with an expert who was mapping the caves, and we went deep, deep, deep into this cave, 600 feet below the ground. It is the largest barometric cave, I think, in the United States, called Wind Cave because it breathes. And luckily, I was with him or I would never would have gotten out. But at one point in the cave, I said, “I wonder where that goes,” and pointed down one of the holes in the rock. And he said, “That's the beginning of becoming a caver, to want to know where does that go?”MICHAEL GARFIELD: Well, to beginnings then. Thank you. Awesome. We'll end it there.LAURENCE GONZALES: Okay. Thank you, Michael.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Thank you, Laurence.
37,Episode Details / Transcript MICHAEL GARFIELD: Well, Mirta, Joshua, Keyan, it's a pleasure to have you on Complexity Podcast.ALL: Thank you for having us.MICHAEL GARFIELD: And I know that the papers that we're going to discuss today are kind of unique to the show in two ways: one is that this is a very timely and intense area of study, a challenging topic. And then the other is that you are in the middle of the second paper. This is probably the earliest that we've even discussed a particular piece of research on the show. So, we're like volcanologists here down in the mouth of the science volcano, and it's really exciting. The right place is to start with, probably, is with a little bit of personal background. So, introduce yourselves and talk about how you got into science, and how you got into this particular project in whatever order y'all want to speak.KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI: So my name is Keyan. I'm a computer scientist by education. I live in Germany, and did my PhD on robotics and evolutionary algorithms. So, I tried to understand how the brain works and tried to find some principles in our deficient systems that could explain how the systems work. Then I moved to Max Planck about 12 years ago, 13 years ago, did my postdoc there, some habitation, and was also working on understanding how the brain works. The last research question I was interested in was understanding how a body contributes to intelligence, so how much less does our brain have to think because the body is the way it is. I actually want to measure that, I wanted to quantify that. By living in Germany, and seeing what's happening, seeing the rise of an alt-right party, and also seeing how civil discourse is shifting and breaking down, I was wondering if we could measure what's going on. I started discussing that with Josh and Mirta at a very early stage, and I had this really small question, and wasn’t sure that it was actually something to go after. But from this small question, the three of us kind of generated this project. Is that helpful?MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah. Yeah. What about you, Josh?JOSHUA GARLAND: I'm currently an Applied Complexity Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. Previously, I was an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. I grew up as a mathematician and then slowly…I guess I started out very theoretical with most of my work, and then I slowly and progressively moved more and more towards applied things, mostly because as I saw as I was doing theoretical research or theoretical math, that I really enjoyed it. But, I also saw the world, in my eyes, sort of falling down around me, and as a mathematician, I was really curious about how I could contribute to helping on these problems? So, for example, I worked a long time in cardiac electrophysiology. I worked for quite some time on climate research, and studying the paleoclimate. And now I've primarily switched to working in hate speech.I take the mathematics and the time series analysis and machine learning tools that I'm comfortable with and try to utilize those, coupled with experts in the field, to understand and try to have an impact on real, societal problems. This project is, in some ways, no different than those projects for me; I see a huge problem right now in civil discourse, and a transition from civil discourse to really polarized, hateful discourse, and I'm curious as a mathematician, how can I contribute to real societal change in that regard? So, I think in terms of how we got into this project, I've seen this big shift in civil discourse in the last two or three years towards being much more hateful and much more polarized. And, there doesn't seem to be a real social theory about how you interact with these people. And so, you know, if you are an immigrant journalist and every single time you post a story, you're constantly being attacked by the alt-right who are saying, “You have no business here, you shouldn't be reporting this,” or “They're doxing your children,” or any number of things that these people say. Then what's an appropriate response? How do you come back at this person? Do you even come back at this person? And there's really no good social guidance for that.And so, you know, I would see people around me that were being attacked in this way or female scientists, for example, who are hearing, “You have no business in science. You shouldn't be a scientist as a woman,” and they have no idea how to respond. So, for me, that's an interesting question: what's an appropriate response when you're being cyber-bullied or when you're receiving hate speech online? Do you respond? Do you try to get your friends to help you protect you? Do you just block the person? Do you ban the person? What's the appropriate response? And, you know, Keyan and I have talked about this several different times, for a variety of reasons.Recently, there’s been an alt-right party that's getting quite a bit of power in Germany, called the Alternative for Deutschland, or the AFD. And alongside them, there's an active hate group that promotes their message, and I think to call them anything but a hate group would be a mistake. And what was interesting is that they self-marked themselves. So, from a computer scientist perspective, that's very interesting because a lot of times the distinguishing “hate” from “not hate” is quite hard and subjective. Like, hat's really just “right” versus “alt-right.” But the big difference here was that they actually started marking themselves as being part of this hate group, and that was very useful as a labeling set for a machine learning person. And then, Keyan and I both got really excited when a TV show host, Jan Böhmermann, announced a movement, called Reconquista Internet, that was aimed at countering this group.  And we were lucky enough to have a lot of insider information from an anonymous source that gave us the IDs, and a lot of other different things about this group, so that we could start monitoring their counter speech efforts, as well.So, from a machine learning perspective, this is fantastic, because now I actually have a data set where I can start thinking about these questions that I've been mulling over in my mind for some time, and thinking about a kind of rigorous approach to quantifying the effectiveness of counter speech. What are the effective strategies? Things like that. So for me, it was a no brainer to jump in and start helping Keyan with this project.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Mirta, for those who didn't episode nine with you, how would you introduce yourself and your line into this particular study?MIRTA GALESIC: Thank you. I’m Mirta Galesic, I’m a professor at the Santa Fe Institute. And, I got lucky to get involved with these guys studying hate and counter speech cause it's in line with my longstanding interest in social norms, and how they're formed, and how they affect what we believe and how we behave. And one important way in which social norms are formed are through language, through communication, for observing what other people are saying or doing. If people are starting to endorse certain ideas that might be potentially dangerous in some way, or could be frightening to certain groups of people, while they're still not only the realm of language – and some people say, well, this is not that important – but eventually, once put in the open, these ideas have the potential to convince others about them. And eventually if enough people share a certain idea, they could start acting on it.And so, I do believe that we cannot look at language in vacuum, and that it's not necessarily okay to just use tactics that we’ve used before when we were not so connected, such as “don't feed the trolls,” which is to not answer, and people will just go away. In this super connected world they are not going to go away, because it's easy to find like-minded people online, even if they are very rare. So, it's important to somehow react and make sure that at least many different lines of discourse are open and are talked about. Hate speech has this property of being threatening and invoking negative emotions in people, like fear and anger. So many people just tend to withdraw or leave the situation, and that's the problem, because then there is no alternative narrative. And so, to an outsider, if somebody stands by, this might signal that this is actually an acceptable way of thinking or behaving.One way that has been considered for a long time and was implemented – it's implemented still in Europe – to counter just the worst kinds of hate speech is censorship. But of course, this doesn’t inform ways, who decides, how is this implemented, how to recognize this ever-evolving language. Another promising way is actually empowering citizens to counter hate. And as Joshua and Keyan were saying, I mean, there is no established way. There is no good theory of how this should be done. We know something from the research of bullying – this is traditional research on bullying in schools, bullying and workplaces – we know what the empower tool is, we know some of what victims can do, but in the online realm, it's mostly qualitative research. And one big problem is that there is no a large data set that where there are labeled speakers of counter speech and hate that could be studied over time and see how these two different kinds of speeches interact with each other, and what actually is effective counter speech.So when Keyan and Joshua came out with this huge data set, and the enormous ability to analyze this in a matter of what seems to me now, seconds, as a the psychologist, I was just enchanted by this. This is the very first time in social science that we have such huge data set spanning six years, and millions and millions of tweets running in parallel to many important societal events, terrorist attacks, political rallies, and now we can study how these two different speeches interact. It's basically a gold mine for many different things we can do. And so, we did some of them now and we are still in process of doing any others.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah, that's a great place to dive in. I want to back up a little bit and talk about the earlier efforts that have been made to try and classify hate speech and the comparably fewer efforts that have been made to classify counter speech, and to talk about how people were trying to go about this, and why you feel that that was insufficient enough to launch into this project. And then, in sort of a longer frame – this is like the subject of the entire first paper – but how did you think differently about this? How did you decide to adopt a different approach and what factors ended up being more useful than those from some of the earlier studies that have been done on this?MIRTA GALESIC: I would say hate speech classification has been around for quite a long time. There are a lot of attempts, and there are a lot of good algorithms that are achieving good scores. The problem always with hate speech, and also polling for us, is that language is continuously evolving, especially given that the algorithms for discovering hate speech are used to ban the hate speech, so you're basically removing the language once you discover it. And of course, other kinds of language are being developed. So, this is an ongoing battle. It’s a very interesting area that has a lot of players. The area of counter speech is less well studied, perhaps one reason is that social media companies are hoping that they could just somehow censor it, abandon it, or filter it out, and this is very difficult for reasons I just mentioned. So, the idea of empowering citizens to do counter speech is actually relatively new. I mean, it has been promoted, especially in the context of cyber bullying of youth, but in the context of hate speech, relatively new. And so, there are several, really good studies on counter speech, however, there are limitations because they are done on small data sets, you know, up to 10,000 posts, classified by hand, by students or be researchers themselves. This limits both the time span in which the speech can be analyzed, and the diversity. I think, there are good qualitative insights, there is some beginning of formal  to counter speech. There is still not enough empirical data to really discern the main ways in which people can engage in complex speech, and in particular, to measure how that interacts with the hate speech. That was just outside the realm of possibility for most researchers in the area of counter speech.JOSHUA GARLAND:  Yeah, I think one of the biggest differentiators is just the labeling problem. All the data sets from the past, or a lot of the prior studies, which are fantastic studies and really got this kicked off, we're really relying on hand labeling every single instance. And so, there was really no automated way of doing this.  I think a big part of it is there aren't very many organized counter speech groups and certainly not organized counter speech groups that self-labeled themselves. Maybe there were a few people trying to resist hate speech in some particular way, but they're not labeling themselves, and they may be taking part in other things. You really have to go through the history of all the things they're saying and, you know, break this apart, and say “This was counter speech,” “This was not,” “This is counter speech,” “This is not,” and it's super time-consuming. As a result, a lot of the studies that have been published before ours, in some instances maybe, had a hundred instances of counter speech, and it's really challenging for any kind of language model when you have a hundred sentences to learn from, maybe.One of the things that really differentiated us was that we were able to collect not hundreds of instances, but tens of millions of instances to start learning with. And I think this really set us apart from that group in terms of that data. Hate speech classifications have been around for a long time and people have been working on it, but it is super subjective. And what I consider hate speech, someone else might not consider hate speech. So again, what really nice about this is that we have a group that's labeling themselves as such, and so have people that have dedicated accounts just for hate speech. So we can really pull and extract a lot of really good sample sets to learn the different languages and learn a lot of the covert and overt signals that they're putting forth, as opposed to having to try to rely on some very small hand-coded set.KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI:  Maybe one thing to add is that we also see that identifying hate seems to be easier because hate is mostly directed to one specific group of persons, immigrants, for example. And then the content is pretty much similar. But for counter speech, it’s more diverse. It can be irony, they can be making fun, or they could be sending pictures. So, it's way harder to identify and classify counter speech than it is to identify hate speech.MICHAEL GARFIELD: In your section on just defining, for the purposes of this study, “hate” and “counter speech,” I thought it was useful that you clarify that there's both a narrow and a broad definition of hate speech, and that like you all have already alluded to, it has in certain respects more to do with the impact or the outcome than it actually has to do with the context in this expanded sense. That it's not simply about overt insult, or discrimination, or using the intimidating or pejorative language, but that it can also just incite hate. And so, as you're saying also with counter speech, that one of the tactics for counter speech – and I want to get into this a little bit more with you later about the different tactics  – but one of those tactics is just sort of absurdity, that it’s kind of like just jamming the conversation, that it's not necessarily specific to particular symbols or signifiers.So just as a way of framing this within a sort of broader complex systems understanding, in terms of understanding a particular organism’s functional relationships within a food web, rather than say the anatomy of that particular organism. That's how I understood this. What you're talking about are the ways that we can identify these patterns of behavior activity in terms of their fruits, socially speaking, in terms of the way that they're organized structurally.JOSHUA GARLAND:  I think one thing that sort of touches on you taking this from a complex systems view…a lot of the prior studies have viewed both utterances of speech and counter speech in isolation. And so you have, in isolation, this particular utterance of hate speech, but you don't have any context of the conversation at large. And so, it's really hard to understand effectiveness and understand the interactions between hate speech and counter speech, if you only have utterances in isolation. So taking more of a complex systems perspective here, what we’re more interested in is more than just individual utterance, we were interested in the dynamics and how those dynamics between the two groups played out over time. And so, another thing that really sets apart our study from other groups is the way that we're approaching the study because we actually have hundreds of thousands of fully resolved conversations between these two groups, un-isolated grounds.  And this is not something that other people have, period. Maybe they have a few conversations, but definitely not at the magnitude or over the longitudinal depth that we have. And so, one of the things that we tried to do was, we were actually able to collect nearly 200,000 reply trees, which are conversations that occurred between the two groups, and then we can use our classifiers. So, then we actually started extracting the dynamics, and I can replay them for any given conversation in a year: What was the proportion of hate speech? What was the proportion of counter speech? Was counter speech directly applying to hate speech, or were they just replying to the conversation? Several different macro and micro level analyses of the dynamics from both the dynamics perspective, but also from a network perspective, as we can discuss, if you'd like. And so, one thing that really kind of shifted our thing from a machine learning classifier task to a more complex systems lens was shifting into studying the dynamic interplay between these two groups, by really studying their interactions, in depth.KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI:  Well, I'm wondering if we should explain why we used to reply trees, and where we got them from. Would that be helpful?MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yes, that was my next question for you.KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI:  So, what we look for is where to scrape, where to get these reply trees from. What would be a good source of reply trees. And in Germany. we have certain news agencies which are considered very reliable and actually neutral, as far as you can be in journalism, right? And we saw over time was that as the alt-right party was getting more extreme to the right, we see that these kind of news outlets are more under attack. They get more replies to each tweet that they tweet. So, their tweet level is almost constant, 40 tweets a day, more or less, but then we see as public discourse shifts more to the right, and things can be said today that were impossible to say years ago, you see that the more and more replies to every tweet by these agencies. And actually, looking at what happened even to myself, when you see tweets by these news agencies, you see disconnect in the replies, right? You see that some neutral tweet about migration pact, for example, over a couple of days, you see very hateful tweets, hateful answers to these messages. And what can happen is that you get the impression that the news agency is tweeting one thing, but that the public thinks something different. It can happen that somebody neutral, like a new user to Twitter just looking for news input, kind of drifts off to get more and more extreme to the right. So that's why we look for these neutral grounds, to see how discussions evolve on these Twitter feeds and how effective counter speech would be in this environment. But please add to that, Josh and Mirta.JOSHUA GARLAND:  So, we actually took a very standard machine learning approach. Our special sauce, if you will, was the data and the labeled data. We had a bunch of labeled data that made it much easier, but the actual pipeline is not very extraordinary. So, what we effectively did was we trained document embeddings, as they're called. We trained a bunch of document embeddings, and then we coupled several document embeddings with logistic regression in order to do the classification stage. Would it be helpful if I go into what any of those words mean?MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah. Okay. I'm sure. I’m trying to make fewer assumptions on the part of our listening audience. So, if you're listening and you're like, wow, they're really dumbing it down for us then…sorry.JOSHUA GARLAND:  So I think one of the fundamental things you have to do when you're building a machine learning model for language is understand how they kind of mathematize language. You know, when you see a tweet in English or in German or whatever, it may be that that doesn't directly translate to something that a neural net or a classifier can use, off the shelf. So, you have to take the language that you're trying to use and you have to translate that language to something that math understands. You need to translate it to some vector representation. But the difficulty in doing that is translating the sentence into a vector representation that somehow has the same meaning as the sentence in English or in German. And that's actually the really hard part, because you kind of want to build in context, you want to build in as much of the sarcasm in context, and little nuances in the language and understanding.  You don't want to simply map every word to one element of the vector and then just have the first element of the vector is "a," the second element of vector "is," "be," and so on. That doesn't make any sense, because then the vectors don't play with each other in space, right? And you want them to interact with each other in space in a way that you would think of them interacting with each other, if you're just having a conversation. And one way you can do that is you can build off this intuition of prediction.So, as I'm listening to someone speak, I have this kind of model in my mind where I'm trying to predict the next words that they're going to say. I can kind of keep up with the conversation, and I can play this out. Whenever I say "fire," there are only so many words that I can say after the word fire and makes sense.  So maybe I say, fire-man, maybe I say fire-truck, but I'm probably not going to say the like fire-Soviet, right? Like I'm not going to like jump completely out of context. So basically, I train a neural net to guess the next word that I'm going to say, and as the neural net gets better and better at guessing the next word that I'm going to say, what it does naturally is it starts understanding the context of the words that I'm saying. It understands that firemen and firetruck all kind of go in the same part of semantic space, and policemen are maybe a little bit different, like police cars and policemen, or maybe in a little different part of space, but they're also sort of in the same context space. They're sort of in the same area of space and they're probably very different than school-house or Congress or these other kinds of things that you can think of.So, what you can do is you build up this kind of semantic, contextual understanding of language, and then we can utilize that to map words and language into some kind of higher-order space where we can then put classifiers. And then I can say, okay, “take all the words that sort of represent emergency, like first responders, into one bin and take all the words that kind of represent government and put them in another bin,” and you can start taking these vectors and then map them into different things, map them into different categories. It’s no different than what we do in the hate speech and counter speech categories. So we have these neural nets that build up a semantic understanding of German language that could take a political German tweet, map it into some space that kind of understands the context as best as it can.And then what we can do, once we have all the vectors mapped into some big space and labeled, it can then say, “Oh, all of these vectors that clustered next to each other are hate speech and all the vectors that clustered over here are counter speech, and all the vectors that are kind of mixed in the middle are neutral speech.” And then we can just use logistic regression or a simple classifier to split that space and given an out of context tweet or a tweet that we haven't seen before, we can pipe it through the neural net. We can map the tweet text or the German or whatever it is to a mathematical representation, and that mathematical representation is then piped into somewhere in the spectrum space, and then we can just ask, “Is this vector more similar to counter speech?  Is it more similar to hate speech? Is it more neutral speech?”So that's kind of the big, high-level idea of how we accomplish this. And then there are tons of nuances that you can get into, right? I just gave you the most vanilla possible representation, but then you can start thinking about how to weight them by term frequency versus the inverse document frequency. Can I build that in? Where do I start the weights of the neural net? Do I start them in the pre-trained state? Do I train them in a randomized state? And you can start thinking about all of these different ways to kind of tweak it and make it better, but at the end of the day, really, those are just like turning the screws on the engine, the pipeline remains the same.And so the other thing that we do on top of that, is that we don't necessarily just build one model because there may not be a best model. One thing that you should know is that I just described this piece of machinery where you take spoken language and you turn it into math space. There are a million different parameters that you can tweak and turn and twist. And each time you twist and turn these different parameters or knobs or screws in your algorithm, the way that the language gets represented is totally different. So, for example, you can think about asking it not to predict the next word I'm going to say, but to predict the third or fourth word I'm going to say. Or skip all these middle words, or only considered only try to predict words that I've seen a hundred times or a thousand times.So you can imagine there's all these different knobs that you can turn. And so, one thing we do is we parse our data set – these millions of tweets that are both hate and counter speech – we parse them into all sorts of different buckets, and then we have neural nets with stickler parameters and logistic regression with particular parameters and we say, “Go learn this language model, and go learn a separation or a decision boundary between hate and counter speech." And we call that an expert. So we can give an expert a spoken piece of language, and then we can say, given that spoken piece of language, put it in a bin of hate counter or neutral.We then have a different expert, which you can think of as just a different person's understanding of language, and it's going to see a different subset of German. It's going to see a different subset of hate speech and counter speech. It's going to be trying to accomplish different tasks. So, it's semantic understanding of the language will be very different or quite different than the first expert, or at least that's what we hope will happen. So you can train many, many, many of these experts, and then you basically collaborate, and say that I give the same tweet to many different experts that have very different understandings of the language, and I hope that each one of the experts can vote on whether it thinks it's hate counter or neutral. Once you build that framework, you can kind of have a consensus protocol where you can say that these three things say it's hate speech, but the other 22 think it's counter speech, so it's probably counter speech, it’s more counter speech. And then you can start defining thresholds where you have to be super confident that it's hate speech, or super confident that it's counter speech because now you have this consensus protocol to build off of. That’s exactly what we do, we take a tree or we take a conversation that occurred on Twitter, and we have all of these different experts that have been trained on this very diverse data sets with different parameters and different understandings of language, and we go down the tree, through the conversation and say each node in this tree, is it hate speech? Is it counter speech? Is just regular neutral speech? Because you can’t expect every single conversation to be pure hate and pure counter speech. There's going to be a, “I really like fries,” or whatever they're staying on Twitter, just mixed in, and we have to be able to distinguish that. Right?So, we can ask the panel of experts to be at a certain level of confidence. If you're at least 93% confident that this is hate speech, we'll mark it as hate speech. Or if you're 93% confident that this is counter speech, we can mark it that way. And then you can actually just eliminate everything in the middle. That's the protocol we take. What that allows us to do is then study these hundreds of thousands of conversations we’ve collected in this longitudinal framework and study how hate speech has evolved. This is how the proportion of hate speech has increased or decreased. This is how counter speech is affected. This is how the intensity increase, right? Like, so you can imagine studying intensity by thinking, Oh, suddenly we're 99% confident that everything in this conversation was hate speech. So, the intensity, meaning what they feel comfortable saying, is becoming much, much more intense to where it's not even a question if this is hate speech anymore, this is not a borderline case anymore. It's very adamant. And so, by passing all these conversations through, we can really start understanding the dynamics and how they interplay between each other.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Just to pull out a little bit, and look at this in a general way, one of the things that I really think is going to become kind of more and more applicable in terms of the way that we negotiate the ambiguity of our complex world in the years to come…this kind of approach also could work very well – it probably is being studied in application on the recognition of deep fakes and this kind of a thing. We're getting to a point where having total confidence about something or relying exclusively on one point of view is no longer sufficient. And I really like, not only that you're talking about training multiple different experts in this way, and comparing them, and creating like a voting system, and establishing a range of confidence, but also that you tested that against human judges. And, you know, it starts to look kind of like the so-called centaurs, where you have teams of humans and machines working together in contest. Do any of you want to speak to how you selected a panel of human judges? Because that's kind of interesting. Although I'm sure this is a pretty common practice, but to me, on the outside, I found it cool how you checked your math against human intuition.MIRTA GALESIC: So should I take that?JOSHUA GARLAND:  Yeah, you're the human expert.MIRTA GALESIC: No! Yeah, so we found a number of German native speakers through Amazon Mechanical Turk and we filter them through several iterations. They all had to pass a test, which was a pretty difficult task, similar to the task they were supposed to solve. And that involved them understanding a story in German that was followed by several comments by readers of an article in German. And they had to say whether the readers agreed or disagreed with the article which required quite a nuanced understanding. And then we gave them some of these tweets to code. They had to say whether this was hate speech or counter speech, or neither. And then in the process, we've seen that some people were doing it much better than others. We were inspecting some part of this, of what they did, and we realized that some people will use it just doing this randomly.  I had a couple of conversations with some people who said, you know, “I really need the money. I'm sorry, I did everything randomly. Please pay me. I don't speak really German,” but somehow they passed the test. Anyhow, after a couple of such rounds of testing them on smaller samples, we ended up with around 25, really good coders that I hope also to use in the future that then reclassified. And so, uh, interestingly, these human coders were extremely well related to the classifier scores, but more so for the hate part of the speech. As Keyan was saying before, there are many ways in which one can do counter speech, and so the correlation was a bit lower for the counterpart. It was still in a monotonic relationship. It was nice, but humans tend to classify counter closer to the neutral speech than they classify hate.JOSHUA GARLAND:  I have something to add. One thing that I think is really important when doing any kind of artificial intelligence is to keep humans in the loop. And I think that's something that's sort of underappreciated in a lot of artificial intelligence. And I had a recent – actually not recent anymore, I think it's been five years….one of SFI’s external professors, Barbara Gross, is one of the big figures right now in artificial intelligence, in my mind. And she talks about how we really shouldn't be shooting for artificial intelligence. We should be shooting for assistive intelligence, and we should be giving artificial intelligence tasks that humans aren't good at, like pattern recognition, but then we should be verifying these things, and putting a human in the loop to kind of subsidize that. So when Mirta was willing to start a Mechanical Turk thing, where we could kind of verify that our farmers weren’t just absolutely crazy, that they weren't labeling very strange patterns, and to see whether they were matching with human intuition, I was all about that.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah! So, I hope now's a good time to dig into your findings and to talk about what you noticed in both the structure of conversations, as well as how these things played out over the years of data that you collected.MIRTA GALESIC: So our main question is whether counter speech works, is it effective in curbing hate? And in particular, whether organized counter speech is better than individual efforts. And it is a very, very difficult question because it is a multifaceted problem and you can observe it many different ways. For example, just think about how you would go about it. Well, you can measure the amount of hate and counter speech online, the proportion you can measure, the average score that a classifier or a human gives to this hate or contract speech to see whether the intensity rises over time. And you can measure it to a finer level, because you can look at how often hate speech is replied to, or how often is counter speech replied to, and what does it do? What happens after hate speech is posted and then counter speech replies? What is due to the rest of the conversation?Then you can also measure the number of likes and retweets, these kind of indicators. And also, you can go even finer, and that's actually a topic of our further project, like what type of counter speech is best? Do use humor? Should you try to convince with facts? Should you post pictures of puppies to drown the discussion? What is actually effective? So, this would help us then to empower individuals to do it better. Because it's such a multifaceted problem, we were actively looking at different measures of the effectiveness. And we find they all suggest that there is value in counter speech. And Keyan can speak more about that, because I know that by now he is trained to speak about it, but there is value come to counter speech.We see that after this Reconquista Internet shows up, the organized counter speech movement, there is an increase in frequency of counter tweets and a slight decrease in the frequency of hate tweets. The counter speech has more power, it is more likely to change the discussion afterwards in a reply tree, in the conversation. So, once the counter speech shows up, it is now more powerful in changing it towards counter speech, rather than keeping it hateful as it was. And so, it seems to us in particular, that this organized element is important because there was counter speech before; We see it’s very prevalent across the whole period of this study from 2015 and earlier, we see a lot of counter speech, not only when this organized group shows up in May or late April of 2018. It's always been there, but when organized hate shows up at the end of 2016, beginning of 2017, the individual counter speech loses its power dramatically.  The whole narrative turns red. Red is our code for hate in our graphs, it's becomes much more difficult for individual counter speakers to balance this discourse. Why? And we know from all the literature on bullying, it's difficult to spend up to the bully when one is alone, especially when there are several bullies. You know, it is frightening. It promotes all kinds of negative emotions. And also, one doesn’t see much point if one’s voice is drowned out immediately by a lot of hate messages. It’s emotionally taxing and it doesn't seem useful, and so people slowly give up. But once the counter speak starts to organize in late April, May of 2019, then we see the difference, because now they come in groups, they know that they have counter speakers in support of each other. There are several of them to respond to haters, and the post helps them to overcome these negative emotions related to this, and also to reinforce their own social norm, to show that there is more than one person who is speaking up. That’s what we found.KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI:  Well, what we see in these conversations with the rise of the organized counter speech group is a kind of signaling behavior. I would see in reply to hate tweets sometimes, hashtags were used, and it seems like these hashtags are used to call other people from the group to join the conversation, which wasn't there before organized counter speech was there, right? And one thing we try to understand is when we see patterns. We see that there's a hate tweet and somebody's replying to that, if a specific group of people is always replying to hate speech, did this have an effect on reducing hate over time? Because if we look at the reply trees, the data we have, it seems to be something that's going on in there.MIRTA GALESIC: I should say, a standard disclaimer, that this kind of data is wonderful, but we cannot decide anything about causal effects. It's very difficult. Of course, society is very complex. There are many things going on at the same time and our data strongly suggests that there is an association between organized counter speech and a more balanced discourse. We should know that the whole society at that time, the general society, was going into a direction of really being pissed off with so much hate. So there was, again Keyan who lives there will know more about it, but there were also some large scale, organized rallies against racism. At the same time, there were also pro-Nazi rallies. So there were a lot of things going on at the same time. Sometimes it's difficult to see the pattern, but because we are looking at it in so many different ways, and with so many different measures, it seems to us that what's emerging is a picture that could suggest that there is actually effective, organized speech.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah, actually one of the key takeaways I got out of your current paper in draft was, towards the end you mentioned that from this data set, the extremity of both types of speech increased over time. So, you're talking about a more balanced discourse on the whole, but it's occurring within an increasingly extreme and polarized environment. And just to link that to other work that's gone on at SFI, where for all the world it looks like there are number of different ways that modern society is pulling apart at the seams.  And given your own sort of personal story, Mirta, growing up in a nation coming apart, I'm curious what the orbital view of that is. I mean, on the one hand, obviously counter speech reducing the frequency of hate speech is good on its own, but on the other side, thinking about this increasingly polarized discourse, is it helping or is it just contributing to the balkanization of our cultures here?MIRTA GALESIC: Yeah, it's an arms race. Once one group starts to speak in extreme terms, it almost seems like the group who is not participating can be losing. At some point…before, at least we could say, “Well, look at this extreme person, we will ostracize them. They will learn the error of their ways. Nobody will buy into these stories,” but these days it just doesn't stop, because there are so many ways to connect with other extreme speakers. And so, the force of extreme speech continuous, it seems that the old rule of not feeding the trolls doesn't work anymore. And so without, even in a way replying in force, I worry that the new kind of speech that's insulting to everyone and everybody, that makes most people feel uncomfortable, might just become the norm and people just retreat and just not engage anymore because it's becoming too toxic in a way. You just stay home.And so at some point…of course it's not healthy in the long run, it's a very stressful situation like organism fighting a disease, if you want, it's stressful. If it takes too long, it's not going to be well for the organism, or for the society. But at some point, I think we need to activate our immune system and fight back. Hopefully in a while we can come back to a more neutral discourse and discuss soccer, and healthy diet options or whatever we were talking about before this all started. That's my impression. But basically, we are all learning as we go. So I'm sure there are many other opinions, maybe even among my coworkers.JOSHUA GARLAND:  Yeah, we actually see this exact thing, which I think is really interesting. And so one thing that was surprising to me, but showed up in the data. was that you know, before Reconquista  Germanica which was the hate group showed up, what'd you see as that most conversation started on the hate side of the spectrum. So, they were a little bit more hateful than neutral discourse, but only slightly. So, what would happen is that you'd have slightly hateful responses to these news things, and then people would come into the conversation and neutralize the conversation. People would come in and respond to the hate, and the whole attitude of the conversation would shift back towards neutral conversation. So some people were angry and responded right away. People would talk some sense into them, and it would kind of calm things down, and you'd come back to a neutral discourse. And that happened emergently or naturally over time. And what happened with Reconquista Germanica was we saw a big shift once they came around.So, once there was organized hate, what happened was that the conversation started hateful. And instead of kind of shifting back to neutral, instead of being kind of watered back down, what we see is that they would either stay hateful, or get even more hateful. So, they would be able to reinforce the hateful rhetoric as opposed to kind of this natural diffusive measure that was occurring. They were reinforcing the hate. And what occurred over time was that this reinforcement mechanism got more intense and more intense over time, where people got more and more bold and to say things they're not supposed to be saying in Germany where hate speech is illegal. And so you kind of look at a conversation and you see that like, “Oh, well the whole discourse is getting kind of more and more hateful, and now it's even more hateful the next day,” but you kind of get the lobster-in-a-pot effect, where you just see it any more and more hateful.  What we were seeing before Reconquista Internet, or the counter, was that the conversation would start out hateful and then drift more and more towards hate. And you saw the norm or the natural state of these conversations being more filled with hate, What you see right after Reconquista Internet is an ability for the conversation to be dragged from this fairly hateful state, down into a neutral counter state. And so, you see this return to more of a neutral state, but then it also seemed to have this relaxation effect after the shock point. We see that Reconquista Internet kind of shocked the system away from this hateful norm, back to something more neutral.But then there was retaliation, right? Different hate groups retaliated and you see more people jumping on that bandwagon and then you see more people countering them, you see more people hating against them, more people countering, and then you see the split and discourse. So you actually see a lot more polarization.  And so from one aspect, you can say that is that overall, if you just think about the effectiveness of counter speech as being this single facet, like, “Did the proportion of hate speech decrease over time?” then I think you can see in our data that the proportion of hate speech did decrease over time. You actually see this gap between neutral counter discourse and hate discourse being like 15 to 20% on average in conversations drop significantly after Reconquista Internet closer to a couple percentage points. So, you do see this massive drop in proportion. So from that, yes counter speech worked, it’s effective, it dropped hate, but then you think about the other facets, like what did it do to our society? Some of the measures we're currently looking at are polarization measures, and it does seem that like having an organized hate group and an organized counter group, grabbing the conversation and pulling it into different directions, is splitting the conversation a bit, and that's actually causing a great deal of polarization. And so all that brought down hate, maybe caused polarization. And so, does that count as being ineffective or is it effective in a different way? It's a really, really hard problem to think about, especially in the growing polarized climate, not just in the U S, but internationally, like in Germany and Brazil and many different places. One of the things that our team is really struggling with currently is how do you even think about effectiveness? If you view it from one angle, yeah, it was effective, but it caused these other problems. And then when you mix into this conversation these causal effects, well, there are also political rallies, and there were also these other events happening at this time. It makes it a really, really fascinating, really interesting data set to work on…but it’s definitely a really challenging thing to think aboutMICHAEL GARFIELD: One of the most interesting things for me, being the Santa Fe Institute social media guy –  because part of my job, unfortunately, is trying to participate in the kind of dehumanizing affordances of social media as they exist in 2020, and being a technologist of attention: trying to game what we know, what I'm learning from SFI about neuroscience and cognitive science,  and use it to craft the stickiest most attractive communiques. And people like Tristan Harris have spoken about this other arms race going on in the tech sector, that is, how do we mop up the most attention? – One of the more interesting pieces out of this for me out of this second draft paper, is what is it that speech groups and counter speech groups are actually looking for as targets? And then, how they're engaging the features of the media that they're choosing to engage with? I would love to hear one or all of you speak to what properties are actually getting identified here. And then what it seems like those properties indicate about the strategies of these groups, and how they’re deliberating their methods of engagement here.JOSHUA GARLAND:  In an effort to try to understand the dynamic interplay between the counter and the hate group, one thing we are interested in is inferring the strategies that are being used by them. So, we're viewing it from the outside. We're not privy to the war room of either Reconquista Germanica or Reconquista Internet, so we don't know what strategies they're imploring. We can record the conversation. We can say, “This is hate speech.” “This is counter speech.” “This is how they interacted.” “This is neutral speech.” We can do that, but we can't say that we know that Reconquista Germanica went after this particular tweet because they use more hashtags, they use more media. We can’t say what it was that attracted so much attention from the hate group to a particular tweet. And so, one thing we were interested in is doing inference on the strategies. Can we reverse infer what strategies are being utilized by the hate group and the resistance group in the background?So, the way that we approached that was with two of our other co-authors who aren't present: John Gabriel at University of Vermont, now, I believe. He just switched from University of Michigan. And Laurent who was a former postdoc at SFI, and is a professor at Vermont. We’re in collaboration with them, and what we did was use choice theory to understand the choices that are being made by the group. The way that this kind of plays out is when you’re user that goes to a social media conversation, like a Twitter reply tree, you have a choice of where you attach to, and who you reply to. Do you reply to the root node, or do you choose to reply to someone that used your favorite hashtag, or particular media, or a particular content, or do you only reply to your friends who are also counter speech? Do you also only refer to your friends that are only hate speech now? What is the strategy that's being employed by these two groups? And while one thing that we're interested in is whether or not counter speech is even effective…let's say that it is, let's just make the hypothesis that counter speech has some effect on discourse. Then what is the most effective strategy in doing that? And, in order to answer that question, we'd really need to be able to infer the strategies that are being used. To do this, we use choice theory, and that allows us to infer the choices that are being made when people approach a conversation.And so, we have several interesting findings in the paper about what choices each group was making, and they seem to be much more structural than content-based, which we found very interesting. I think one of our primary conclusions from this analysis was that both Reconquista Germanica and Reconquista Internet were very good at choosing to attach to the tree in ways that made them maximally visible…so they seemed to be much less interested in particular content, but were replying to the tree in a particular way where their content would be most visible to an outside observer, which is a very interesting perspective. And the way that they do this is by leveraging things like the display algorithm in such a way as to make them able to do this. For example, by replying directly to the root, or replying to very new tweets or replying to very heavily liked or retweeted tweets, they could leverage the display algorithm in ways to propagate their message forward. And, you know, just like we can't claim causality with the time series analysis we're doing, we also can't say that we can know the strategy that they're using, or say that Reconquista Internet was fundamentally leveraging Twitter's algorithm to maximize display preference. But we will say that the way that they chose to interact did maximize their display chances, and so that's kind of the reason we have that take in our paper. We found it really exciting.MICHAEL GARFIELD: There's another thing here, and I want to be respectful to y’all, and wrap this here shortly, but the key point that I was really looking forward to discussing with you – Joshua, I remember you giving a talk at SFI, I think it was last year where you talking about what you can see from orbit with these conversation trees, and how the network structure of these different conversations yields some insight into the nature of those conversations. And to me, this was such a profound flip in the way that I thought about the possibility for designing future user interfaces. Given that the Twitter API is available, you know, what would it look like, and what would the benefits be of, for example, (and I know this I've been haranguing you about this for almost a year), but the idea of designing a different user interface for Twitter that allows you to see the quality of a conversation before you decide to participate in it, just looking at the structural features instead of the content features. So, could you talk a little bit about that piece of it, about what you can see just by looking at the graph rather than by digging into the tweets themselves?JOSHUA GARLAND:  So, in some of our preliminary analysis, what we saw was that there were structural differences about how the hate encounter groups interacted, and how the neutral speech interacted. So, there are different distributions in the choices they’re making. And so, just like I was just talking about the choice theory, what you can say is that, given that you're part of the hate group, what is your strategy? And use that to attach to the tree. Or given that you're a counter group, how do you attach to the tree? But you can also ask, if you're just a regular generic citizen not part of the hate of the counter group. How do you attach to the tree? And some of our analysis showed that looking at how different people chose to attach to the tree was predictive of whether they were a hate member, a counter member, or just a neutral citizen.  I think that's what I was talking about then.And so, in our early analysis– and I think we should probably check this because I think it changed quite a bit since we changed the algorithm – but what we saw was that haters attached directly to the roots, a lot of hate speech was attaching directly to the root node. They were not participating in a conversation. And for example, you saw a lot of counter speech, attaching to the leaves, or attaching to the circumference of the network. But, again, I think that changed quite a bit. Mirta, do you remember this?KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI:  I wonder if you could use that to actually identify how you encounter accounts? Could that be like one piece of the puzzle?JOSHUA GARLAND:  I think if you actually got a really good understanding of the choices that are being made as to strategies, that could be utilized. I think one of the more interesting ways to utilize that would be actually to change the display algorithms to kind of mix between the two. So there's a display algorithm where I know exactly the kind of tweets that are going to be displayed prominently, and the kind of tweets are going to kind of get pushed down. If I want to push my message as a member of a hate group, or a member of the counter group, I can leverage the display algorithm to propagate my message. And there have been many studies that have shown that, right? Where groups on Reddit or groups on Twitter have attached in particular ways to conversations, or liked in particular ways to propagate a message forward and to make it seem like it's more prominent message than it really is. And it was surprisingly, you can do that with very little interaction. You can kind of propagate a message to the front page of Reddit, things like that. And so, what I think might be really useful is that if companies like Twitter or Facebook or Reddit looked at what the strategies are that are being leveraged, and then were able to mix up their display algorithms so that you can't leverage these things as easily, I think that can be super beneficial.KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI:  I was saying, if you could change the display algorithm, could you actually reduce hate speech. Is that what somebody was saying?JOSHUA GARLAND:  Maybe. I think if you have a fixed display algorithm, you can weaponize that, right? As soon as the display is fixed, it's weaponizable. But if you randomize the display over them on a daily or weekly basis, where you don't know what's going to be the prominent tweet that's shown, then it's really hard to weaponize that display algorithm. That’s all I was getting at.KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI:  So kind of messing with this strategy of posting hate.JOSHUA GARLAND:  Yeah, exactly.MICHAEL GARFIELD: I mean, that would probably strike it at the heart of the ad revenue model, though. You got to have one that doesn't give massive preference to engagement, because that's a huge well-recognized piece of the way that social media has contributed to the polarization of discourse. Pissing people off is a better way to get eyes on your posts.JOSHUA GARLAND:  No, I think that that's very fair. And you know, it really gets back to the kind of multifaceted nature of effectiveness. If you do counter speech, and you drive everybody off the platform so there's no hate speech but there's no speech, nobody's talking at all, nobody talks to each other, was that actually effective, from Twitter's perspective? That's awful because there's no more ad revenue, right? So, it's very ineffective to have counter speech if you drive everybody off the platform, but by the same accord, if all of the Nazis come in and they just hate speech hate speech, hate speech, and that drives everybody off, okay, was that effective? Because then they're no longer propagating their message. It's this really interesting interplay between what do you mean by when you say “effective,” and what do you mean when you try to parse this apart? And if you view it from the perspective of an average citizen or if viewed from a politician’s standpoint, or from the ad revenue model standpoint, “effectiveness” wildly changes. It's this moving target that we're trying to analyze in this work, and it's proving to be super challenging.MICHAEL GARFIELD: So that, that brings us into the last question that I have, about the glowing open questions that you're hoping to answer in this paper, in its final form, and in follow up research. And then, what are you hoping that people latch onto and take home from this, and consider how that might change the everyday practical implications and so on. You spoke to some of that already, but I feel like that's a good place to button this up.JOSHUA GARLAND:  What do we want the final takeaway to be?KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI:  Maybe I can give it a shot. So, my hope would be from the current research that we have that the take-home message is to organize yourself. It seems to have an effect, and it seems that organized counter speech is more effective in countering hate. That'd be my hope in the long term. I would hope to, and I know this is not realistic, but maybe to have a handbook for counter speech: what would be the best strategies for specific forms of hate? It’s not so much a one to one rule, you know, “if this comes, then do this,” “if this comes into this,” but maybe the most effective strategies, or most likely effective strategies for specific types of hate, and how could you counter that in a civil way without destroying the discourse? That will be my hope for the long run.MIRTA GALESIC: Yeah, I agree with that. I think that the first question was “does it all matter?” And it seems like it matters. And now the next question is how can we tailor it so that it's even more effective? How can we empower others to do it? And that's what Keyan is saying. What are the strategies that actually work? Should we attack? Should we laugh? Should we help the weak teams to survive more? What can we do?MICHAEL GARFIELD: And in a way that doesn't just accelerate the arms race, hopefully, I imagine.KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI:  Yes, in a way that will bring it back to the civil discourse like it was before, when we talked about recipes and football scores, and not about violence, right?JOSHUA GARLAND:  Yeah. I mean, can we curb hate, or could we come up with effective strategies that are backed by science that really tell you what is an effective way to counter hate without just increasing polarization? And I think that polarization is destroying our society in so many ways. You know, we're getting to a point in the US where you can't send a news article from particular outlets to another friend without being worried you're going to ruin that friendship. And people say two words and you just know that they're on the right, or they're on the left, and so you just don't speak to them anymore.  It’s just toxic and that's not the way that we're going to go forth in our society. We can't have a transmission of ideas that way. You know, the right has great ideas. The left has great ideas. We need to come together to be a better people. And I think that one of the most important things that I hope…you know, you said what I get to hope, So I get to pick anything I want: I hope that we come up with effective ways to curb hate both on the right and on the left, and return to a civil discourse where we can come together as a society, and we can talk about pizza without worrying about whether Obama had pizza, or if Trump had pizza. That's not the point. We can have a great pizza recipe and just discuss that. Bring it back to civil discourse.And what I'm hoping is that we can come up with a rigorous social theory that tells people how to counter hate in a productive way that's non-polarizing. And I also hope that our work alleviates a lot of the ethical burden on social media platforms. Right now, you know, the government has kind of shelled off, in the U S in particular, the government has kind of shelled off all the social, ethical, legal, responsibility of censorship and propagation of ideas onto these social media platforms. It's really not fair. So you'd say, “Facebook, you need to worry about censoring hate speech, and you need to be worried about censoring these groups, and it's your choice who you ban and how you propagate these ideas and how you deal with misinformation and disinformation,” etc. It puts a huge amount of burden on these companies. And I think if we could empower citizens to do this, and citizens to come in and say, “We don't support these ideas. We don't hate immigrants. We don't hate the women in science. We don't hate all these things that the alt-right is against.” and we have proper ways to respond that shifts our society back to a neutral place. I think that would be a fantastic outcome of this study. And I think it’s something that's actually achievable that we can do.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Wow! I'm imagining this fantasy future in which Facebook is actually paying me to engage in de-polarization of discourse, that we've been volunteering for years, but anyway.JOSHUA GARLAND:  One of the exciting things about the way our group is approaching this problem is trying to bridge the gap between academics and industry. There are a lot of problems in academics that can't be solved by academics alone, and the same on the industry side. They need an academic/industry perspective. And so, one of the things our team is trying to do is marry together, not just mathematicians and social scientists and network theorists and all these different groups on the academic side, but we're also trying to bridge the gap to actual industry companies. So, actually trying to talk with Twitter and Facebook and Reddit, and actually bring them on board, because we think this is actually going to meaningfully impactful in the space. You not only need the academics thinking really hard about the background theory and talking to each other across disciplines like we always do at SFI, we really need to bring an industry and say, “How do we take what we're finding in this, what we're understanding, and apply it on an industrial scale?” We have a recent initiative at SFI where we're marrying academics to industry through a fellowship where each fellow is tied to academic advisors, as well as being tied to industry advisors, in an effort to bridge the gap between academics and industry. That's called the Applied Complexity Fellowship, and that is a brand-new fellowship that we're starting at SFI, and we encourage you to reach out and discuss it with us if you're interested.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Awesome. It's been absolutely wonderful to talk about your research with you, and thank you for doing this. And, there is a lot of stuff that comes out of SFI that I feel has really sort of profound social implications, and this is right up there at the top of the list. So, thanks all. I hope that this podcast draws some useful attention to you and your research.MIRTA GALESIC: Thank you for having us.KEYAN GHAZI-ZAHEDI:  Yeah.
38,Episode Details / Transcript Transcript produced by Podscribe and edited by Rayyan Zahid. [Intro] 00:00 :You know if you have a forest with a lot of dry wood that hasn’t been cleared away, by previous small conflagration you can have a major conflagration, right? I am not saying that, that is conflict. But you could imagine some kind of rule that a regulator would perform in society. I don’t know what that rule is, but definitely one of the ways it manifests is by preventing the largest outbreaks from happening. Or, an attempt to.And, you know, one of the ideas behind some of the models that have been proposed for conflict is actually similar to this forest fire thing. Which is that, the conditions for conflict will simmer, and when it reaches that boiling, you can have one. And when you have one, it’s this big thing but it depletes the system in a way.And so, you are always poised between never being able to have these big conflicts and having these sorts of having like these smaller conflicts. Would it be good to prevent all conflicts or would it be bad? Would that sort of lead to some sort of special situation where you suddenly had the nuclear Armageddon? I don’t know. [Intro music] 01:00 : Michael Garfield 01:24:Since the 1940s scientists have puzzled over a curious finding. Armed conflict data reveals that human battles obey a power law distribution like avalanches and epidemics. Just like the fractal surfaces of mountains and cauliflowers, the shape of violence looks the same at any level of magnification.Beyond the particulars of why we fight, this pattern suggests a deep hidden order in the physical laws governing society. And digging in the new analysis of data from both armed conflicts and voting patterns, complex systems researchers have started to identify the so-called pivotal components involved. The straw that breaks the camel’s back. The spark that sets the forest fire. The influential but not always famous figures that shape history.Michael Garfield 02:11Can science find a universal theory that predicts the size of conflict from their initial conditions? Or identity key players whose knob society in one direction or another? Welcome to Complexity. The official podcast of the Santé Fe Institute.I am your host Michael Garfield. And each week we’ll bring you with us on far ranging on rigorous researchers developing new frameworks explaining the deepest mysteries of the universe. Michael Garfield 02:39:This week’s guest is SFI program postdoctoral Eddie Lee. Whose work in conflict avalanches and swing voters gives a glimpse of the mysterious forces that determine why we fight. And how we will be able to prevent the next conflagration. In this episode we talk about armed conflict as a fractal and a form of computation. Swing voters in the justice and influencers in pop cultures. And what these studies may have to say about the deep constraints that guide the currents of society. Michael Garfield  03:11:Just a note that this will be our last episode before short summer break to give our scientists uninterrupted time to work on a torrent of new research. We have some exciting episodes scheduled for our return in mid-august.

Well, shall we Eddie Lee 04:25:All right, let's do it. Michael Garfield 04:26:Yeah. Eddie Lee, it is a pleasure to have you here and our first ever in person, socially distanced podcast recording here across my patio. So welcome. Eddie Lee 04:39 :Thanks for having me. This is great. Michael Garfield 04:42 :I'd love to start as we typically do by just providing a little bit of personal background and having you talk a little bit about how you got into science and how you got into specifically an interest in the kind of research that you're doing at SFI and the stuff that we'll be talking about today. Eddie Lee 05:00 :Well, I think it was last week that actually the writer of the magic school bus series passed away. And, you know, I have to say that she really did leave a fantastic legacy and I'm part of that legacy. I grew up on, on the magic school bus and actually some after school science programs as well. So, I sort of had this nascent interest in science for a long time, something I enjoyed doing. I didn't really see myself becoming a scientist. Eddie Lee 05:32:And in fact, when I went to college, I actually tried to become an economics major surprisingly enough, but it turned out that I took this sort of fantastic course called integrated sciences. And it's sort of my preview in a way to complex sciences, because what it was a class telling us, showing us that the way of thinking in computer science, biology, chemistry, physics, we're all coming together in the context of some fascinating problems in biology. Eddie Lee 06:03:So, this idea that all these things were coming together was a really surprising thing for me. And I think what really sort of hit it home was when I read this book by Phillip ball called critical mass. And so, he brought up the aspect of society, also being part of this. And, you know, at some point in my past, I'd also read Isaac Asimov's foundation series, which is, which is the physics of social behavior and prediction. And so somehow all of these things were sort of swirling around in my head. Eddie Lee 06:35:I didn't know what to do about them. And I ended up imagining what I really need to do is go into sociology. So, I went to, I searched around, I'd try to talk with sociology professors. And I just talked with one, I think he was maybe at the head of the Taryn at the time. And he said, you know, I know this guy who might be able to direct you. And he couldn't remember the name, but he started searching online and he showed me the web page. And it was one of the professors who had taught that first class, that first course that I mentioned integrated sciences. Eddie Lee 07:05:So, he sorts of just sent me right back. Yeah. Boomerang style back into that professor's office. And he actually was familiar with SFI. So, he's the one who directed me to talk with Jessica and Dave Cracker, who now I've known for a long time. And that's sort of where all of this stuff started happening. And that's when I started really learning about what sort of science SFI works on and my sort of vague interest in it became, you know, crystallized. Michael Garfield 07:37:Awesome. Well, this is a great place actually, to just dig right in to the first set of papers I wanted to talk with you about today, which you co-authored with David and Jessica, as well as Brian Daniels and Chris Myers on scaling theory for armed conflict avalanches. So this idea that we can use physics insights to understand human social behavior from like an orbital perspective and like really much like in the foundation books, you know, that we can, we can come at the, the sort of vagaries of history from, you know, David would call a rigorous and principled quantitative approach. Michael Garfield 08:23:The history is not just the story of great men making decisions, but that those decisions occur within a landscape of physical constraints. And what are those constraints and how do they manifest themselves? And this is really interesting work and it's got a long history that you're building on. And so maybe the history of this strain of research is the right place to start. And then we can unpack it from there. Eddie Lee 08:48:Sure. Yeah. Like you're saying, it's interesting, but what we weren't focusing on was the particular stories of particular conflicts. And there's a lot to study about any particular conflict they're quite different, right? So, you might think of say the Libyan or Tunisian revolutions happening today, which are quite different from world war two, which were quite different from the British and French battling it out, say in 1812. So, these are all very distinct lines of history in and of their own. Eddie Lee 09:20:And so, what we were interested in was trying to understand whether or not there were universalities common features shared amongst these things that are clearly disparate. And as you were saying, this isn't a completely new idea. It was in 1948 that Louis Fry Richardson showed this amazing feature, which was that when you make a histogram of interstate Wars, so you count how many wars there are with F people that died, F fatalities. And you look at this histogram on a log plot, what you find is a straight line. Eddie Lee 09:54:And what's remarkable about a straight line being on a log plot is that it's, that's a power law. That means its scale free. In other words, sort of most, very naively speaking. If you were to look at a small conflict, it's sort of like a shrunk down version, statistically, speaking of a large conflict and so on and so forth all the way down. And so, this was very strange because interstate wars that you looked at were all quite different from one another. So why would you get this sort of regularity that emerges when you look across many different conflicts? Eddie Lee 10:27:And since then other people have noticed other interesting patterns in the timing of conflicts, as well, as well as terrorism and so on. And what we were interested in was looking for some of these patterns in a more recent dataset, which is called the armed conflict location event, data project, or ACLED for short. And what was remarkable about this data set was that they didn't take all these events, these small disparate individual conflict events that would occur in a war. They didn't group them together into wars. Eddie Lee 11:00:They just sort of disaggregated them into, into small localized defense. And so instead of having to take a quantity, that's already defined for you as a battle or a war or skirmish, or just a local riot, we got to connect these into ourselves, into these clusters of what we called conflict avalanches. So many ways similar to two battles or Wars, but without having assumed some of these connections from using sociopolitical factors. So just looking at the time and spatial patterns of these events, and what we found was that when you look at these conflict avalanches, various measures of their size, so not just how many people died, but how many of these reports did you obtain? Eddie Lee 11:43:How long did it last, how far did it spread? All of these different factors show these characteristic power law tales, like what Richardson saw and what we were able to do beyond that is to show that these pieces were all connected to one another in some mathematical way. And I think I had an analogy for this, which was that if you imagine you walk into a dark room and you're trying to figure out what is this object in front of you? Eddie Lee 12:12:And you find first, there's this sort of rigid pillar. Then you find this long sort of thing with a hairy end. You find this floppy disc, like thing, you start in your mind developing this picture of an elephant. And the way that that works is all these pieces are connected to one another, right? They're pieces of one whole. They're not independent, separate things. And so, you build a model in your head and you say, this must be connected. The legs must be connected to the body, must be connected to the head and so on. Eddie Lee 12:43:So, we did something like that with the mathematics of these various features. And we found that they were self-consistent in a way that seems to point to one sort of object driving the dynamics.  Eddie Lee 12:55:And that's sort of really cool because it suggests that there is some sort of underlying thing that we're just getting hints of. We haven't found it yet. We haven't discovered exactly what it is. Obviously, it's something about war and conflict, but it's perhaps something bigger, right? That leads to universal patterns, across many different types of conflict. Michael Garfield 13:17:So, you draw some analogies in one of the preprints that you've done on this work, emergent regularities and scaling and armed conflict data. You draw analogies to forest fire models, which other researchers have tried to apply to this, to neural avalanches. And, you know, just from last week's episode with the SFI counter speech team and the network graphs that you see of the Twitter data that they've harvested, and the way that you see these conversations, these sort of battles between hate speech, organized, hate speech groups and organized counter speech groups on Twitter. Michael Garfield 13:56:And this look also like these, you know, you see these the sort of conflagration of point by point debate breaking out when there's a successful, an actual collision, rather than just the hate group eliciting engagement to its original post. But people are actually willing to go into the trenches with one another on social media. And so, I would love to hear you talk a little bit more specifically about this model as a, like a branching network diagram. Michael Garfield 14:26:Yeah. There's some really interesting figures, and we'll link to this stuff in the show notes so that people can, can actually get a look at what we're talking about here. Because it actually looks rather menacing. Eddie Lee 14:39:That's why we chose those colors. Michael Garfield 14:41:The map of a branching armed conflict here. Eddie Lee 14:44:Yeah. So, cascades are a real central conceptual foundation for understanding a lot of these different kinds of phenomena. And as you mentioned, if you look at neural activity in the cortex, what you find are, are these cascades of activity, and it's not just a bunch of neurons firing, you can actually trace it out to some sort of branching process. So, you imagine there's the center, the first neuron that activates other neurons, which activate other neurons and so on sort of in a conflagration type picture. Eddie Lee 15:24:And you can also think about various other phenomena with this sort of conceptual framework. So, forest fires are another way, right? So, you imagine you have a bunch of sorts of local clusters of maybe dried out patches of trees and you have a spark, maybe some lightning strikes, and then it sort of burns its way through all these connected clusters. And you can think about that analogy applying to, to social contagion as well. And so that's why we sort of started with this idea of thinking about conflict in the same way. Eddie Lee 15:55:And mathematically, it's a very generic way of thinking about it, right? All of that you need are different pieces that are connected to one another in this sort of branching way. And so, you can get this exponential increase. Actually, this is very relevant in the context of today with COVID right? So, when people talk about exponentially growing processes, this is exactly what they mean. Or you have someone who spreads it to some other people. And if each person on average spreads up to more than one person, then you have an explosion. So, we sort of were playing with this framework and thinking about conflict in this way as a social contagion. Eddie Lee 16:29:And we're not sure if that's exactly how it spreads, but we can at least say that the way that it spreads is consistent with this idea of the way that it spreads both across space, as well as across time and in size. Michael Garfield 16:46:So, this elicits for me, links back to this sort of giant network model and building of this, these conversations on the show with all of the other conversations that hopefully we'll publish in the SFI press one day and make a poster. This reminds me a lot of, of two things. One is the conversations I just had with Jeffrey West a few episodes ago, where he was talking about biophysical scaling laws as being extremely coarse and like not actually capturing all of the variation that we would see in like specific evolutionary instances. The Primo example, being that human beings, modern humans use something like 30 times more energetic resources than we would expect from mammals of this size. Michael Garfield 17:33:Because as we've talked about with David and some of the transmission episodes, the human being is basically just the visible corner of this hyper object now. And then each of us is actually like a cyborg spanning the globe with all of these electronic augmentations. Right? So, something like that is going on in this work with conflict. And when you actually peer into the data with a little bit more granularity, you see a lot of variation in this, not enough to challenge the thesis, but enough to suggest that there are some interesting details about the regional and temporal variations of these conflicts. Michael Garfield 18:14:And I would love to hear you talk about that. And then also just to like make this kind of unwieldy let's pin onto that since you brought up COVID, Chris Morris piece for the transmission series, where you talking about super spreader and that's and how the, you know, our zero as a measure of the transmissibility of a disease, doesn't actually tell you what's going on in that particular church or in that particular campus building or, you know, so there's. So, what are the features about the data set that you've noticed that seemed to be providing insights into why there's variations in the size of these conflicts around that mean. Eddie Lee 18:56:No, that's, that's great. I mean, I think it's really important to point out that a lot of this work 's goal isn't to explain all this variation, which, you know, eventually we want to do, but it's really to talk about the shared common features across all of these phenomena. And then of course it's important to mention that, that's the only thing it explains. And so, the features that I'm talking about in terms of scaling are the averages, but you can have scaling in the variation as well. Eddie Lee 19:29:And that's, that's really interesting. And as you mentioned, right, you know, Chris Moore wrote that very nice piece where it's really important to mention that are not, is an average and not necessarily going to tell you what's happening in a very particular location. And that's also exactly true for theories about metabolic scaling in force or conflict. And in fact, it turns out that that sort of variation manifests directly in our work looking at conflict. Eddie Lee 20:02:And one of the things that we find is that it's not only essential to account for the similarities between how conflict grows in different locations, but there's also variation in terms of this sort of coefficient in front of it. So, the way that it grows the shape of the curve may be similar, but the offset of that curve may be different. And that might depend on factors such as prosperity or governance. So, here's one example, right? So, you look at Eastern Somalia, weak governance, a lot of widespread poverty and a huge amount of conflict. Eddie Lee 20:36:One of the hot zones in this and the status set. But if you look at South Africa, it's quite prosperous, they have a pretty strong government and its relatively low levels of conflict. So even if it's the case, that conflict evolves in a similar way, you just don't expect to see as much conflict and South Africa, as you see in Eastern Somalia. And so, as you also said, these things will vary in time. So hopefully Eastern Somalia is not a hotspot forever, but maybe somewhere else will become one. So, there may be patterns also in the diversity of hot zones. Eddie Lee 21:09:And we see a hint of this. We can't say that will be the case forever because we only look at 20 years. But one of the sort of fascinating things is that Richardson, who I mentioned earlier, looked at wars between, I think, early 1800s and mid-1900s. And he found basically the same statistics. Aaron?? looked at the statistics all the way from Richardson's asset up to today and found the same statistics. So, there's some sort of weird preservation of conflict despite changing technology, different countries. And, and so on that either, I don't know, is, should you be amazed or should you be afraid?  Michael Garfield 21:47:Well, I mean, again, two things come up here, right? One is Jen Dunn's work on food webs and how the structure of these food webs that their patterns of connectivity have been amazingly well-preserved conserved in there, in their form for like the last 500 million years as we've gone through all of these regimes in what is actually living in the oceans. So that's part of it, you know, and that's, that's sort of begs the question that I asked Brian Arthur, which is, do you think that we can use these models as a way of predicting like basins for future innovation, you know, and like predicting areas where we can expect potentially larger conflicts than we're seeing. Michael Garfield 22:30:And then the other piece of it is, bringing in the geopolitical component, Peter Turchin's work. When we're talking about a quantitative study of history and his writing on what he called the double helix of inequality and social instability, where he saw that they were very strongly negatively correlated over the last a hundred or 150 years. But, you know, you make a point in this paper that there are other geopolitical and geographic features that have to do with the coastlines and national borders and locations of these conflicts relative to large urban centers' populations. Michael Garfield 23:11:Yeah. So, I, again, I know that this is sort of beyond the scope of the paper, but I'm really curious, you know, what other, what other factors you think are playing into this and how that might be guiding your follow-up research in this area? Eddie Lee 23:23:I think what you can say is despite the fact that there are a lot of these universal patterns that we think we find is that there's a lot of work trying to understand the mechanisms behind why these patterns might appear. And I think there is yet a connection to be made there. And that would be sort of, I think the Holy grail for, for this sort of work is really understanding those connections and flushing them out. Eddie Lee 23:53:And somehow, they lie in the intersection of maybe social mobility, social prosperity, economic prosperity, technology, geography, right. You can't really fight someone if there's no one there, Michael Garfield 24:08:Tell that to our Facebook group. Eddie Lee 24:13:Yeah. I guess you could make up stories and so on, but there are a lot of different factors that somehow mashed together to generate these patterns. But as you were mentioning, Jen Dunn's work. That's not necessarily to say that you can't get universal patterns from that. So, you know, this is maybe too simple of an example, but one sort of that comes to mind right now, which is the central limit theorem, right? There are many reasons for why you get random likes statistics, right? Eddie Lee 24:46:Many different ways of generating them, but by virtue of their randomness, you end up getting some sort of regularity. So, we'll see. Maybe it's the fact that there are so many factors that do influence conflict that ended up getting simplification at higher scales, or maybe not, maybe, maybe it is contingent. And we, we just don't have enough granularity in our understanding to access that contingency Michael Garfield 25:15:Later on, in this paper, you talked about there being, you know, getting into this granularity, you say: "Unlike canonical cascade models, conflict also includes lattice style dynamics that evolve with geographic spread. The suppression of these dynamics away from the core could reflect social processes or geography that impact conflict evolution. Furthermore, our model suggests conflict is not only the result of local correlations and activity, but also regional and temporal disorder, perhaps reflecting memory of the severity of initiating events". Michael Garfield 25:47:So, this links directly to another paper that you wrote with Brian, David and Jessica on primate conflicts and temporal scaling collapse. And the idea, you know, Jessica's work on primate conflicts as a form of collective computation and the severity of those conflicts having to do with various factors that are performing computations at the level of like an entire primate troupe, right? So, this notion that the patterns that you're seeing in conflict data, that they hinge on there being certain evolutionary reasons for the distribution of conflict, duration, and severity is really interesting. I'm curious to hear you talk a little bit about this other paper and how it links in. Eddie Lee 26:36:Right. No, that's, that's interesting. Right? What are the functional properties of conflict, right? Is there a reason why conflict plays out the way that it does? It's hard to say for human conflicts. Obviously, there are reasons why people give for starting wars. But in monkey conflict, there's potentially one reason which is, has to do with a social hierarchy, right? So, you need to have a little bit of disorder and conflict in order to establish people's roles and where they sit. Eddie Lee 27:07:And the severity of the conflict at the same time cannot be too, too big, right. If it's too severe, it's actually detrimental to society. So, there's this idea that maybe what conflicts does is it serves an information gathering acquisition role, as long as it's not too bad, Michael Garfield 27:26:People have to survive, remember. Eddie Lee 27:28:Exactly. If you don't, if you know, if it's nuclear Armageddon again and that's it, we should remember that. But, I think one of the things that we were trying to study in that work was characterizing the features of monkey conflict and perhaps extracting from those features a potential functional role that, that these things, or these observations could, could conserve. Eddie Lee 27:53:And actually, what's really interesting about the monkey conflict is we studied a group, a society of ??. What we found was that the duration that conflicts lasted well, beta distribution, it was not a parallel distribution like human conflict, but how long they lasted that distribution of duration seemed to be a distribution that looked the same, whether you looked at small conflicts or large complex. And it's very strange because conflicts with 2 monkeys are not the same thing as conflicts with 10 monkeys. Eddie Lee 28:24:There are many more ways they can interact. There are many other things that could happen, go wrong. And so, this was very curious. And so what we found was that if you could think of these conflicts as being sort of the time for all the pairs to resolve their differences, and each of those pairs, or took some amount of time to resolve their differences, then you could get something similar to what we found in the data with the condition that the pairs that resolve their differences later remembered the sort of intensity with which the pairs resolved their differences earlier. Eddie Lee 29:03:So, in other words, if the fight started off with some intense pairwise interactions, like, you know, you bit me, how could you bite me? And that's, that's actually very apparently a very aggressive interaction that the other monkeys will not tolerate. Michael Garfield 29:18:I remember preschool. Yeah. Eddie Lee 29:19:And so, you end up having these long correlations from the beginning to the end, and if that's true, then you end up getting these, these sort of long tails of conflict duration. So, you have many conflicts that tend to last longer. And for us, when we, that was an indication of what we call collective memory, right. This idea that the entire duration of the conflict from beginning to end, some remember at the beginning. And that's what we mean by we say in that paper. Michael Garfield 30:00:Well, okay. So, you know, this, I have the luxury here of kind of like going out on the plank and speculating. Yeah. But this seems to be possibly why certain human conflicts are just insane, like the Hatfield’s and McCoy’s, you know, that the feud has a sort of durability built into it because of the way that the history of a family is prioritized. And like the, you know, the bigger the conflict gets, it would seem like certainly there are factors that are keeping resolution that are like forestalling resolution, but on the other hand, the more abstract the conflict becomes for people, the easier it is to get over. Michael Garfield 30:45:Right. So, you know, this, this is sort of like, you know, I wonder what this approach to understanding this might have to say to, or link with other work on the way that conflict between human beings has changed as war has become industrialized and has been more and more about foreign conflicts rather than defending your own, your Athens or whatever. From there are certain things that would seem to be kind of holding us in the United States in a position of kind of unending foreign Wars. Eddie Lee 31:20:Right. Well, I think it's a little bit unfair to say that these Wars are external. Right. For many people, these Wars are personal, right? Yeah. And that's their life, but sort of touching on this, on this question of, you know, how is it that conflict persists or why is it that conflict persists? I think one thing we suspect from looking at these patterns is that these memories, these core correlations in a conflict, are expressed not only in the history that people maintain about themselves, but also in the geography of how it spreads. Eddie Lee31:57:So, it's quite possible that what encodes the history of the conflict is not just what we think right, the stories that we tell ourselves, but potentially also factors of the environment. Structures that we build. And some of these structures are really obvious, right. I mean, we built the nuclear arsenal, right. It's going to be there. Right. This is really interesting to me, it sort of connects to some of the work that David, Jess and I have been doing recently with adaptation and outsourcing a memory into the environment. Eddie Lee 32:30:Right. Which is this idea that there are biological organisms that intentionally or use and manipulate the environment to couple their bad memory or the behavior with longer timescales that they need in order to better adapt. So, ants do this by building these trails. It's unlikely that individual ants can really remember what they're doing, but over the collective activity of many, they can establish these very long-lived persistent trails. And they can use this trail to harness resources. Michael Garfield: like Google calendar. Eddie Lee 33:01:Exactly. No, I mean, let me do exactly the same thing, right. I mean, David has that example of the notepad, right? Multiply three times, six times, five times, 2,374. I can't do it in my head, but give me a piece of paper. I can just, basically you short term memory expressed on paper to do that calculation very efficiently. And in addition to opening up new ways of doing that calculation, that aren't accessible in my head to myself. So, there is this question, right? Sort of going back to the functional properties of armed conflict, you know, what purpose does armed conflict solve? Eddie Lee 33:32:Are there ways that we are sort of driving our conflict ourselves by embedding into our environment that we don't know of, that we do know of. And I don't think those questions are necessarily answered. At least I haven't seen those answers, but would be really interesting to think about, I mean, right, this is just one other phenomenon in nature, right? It's not just us that fight. We do fight with certain technologies and armed human conflicts or especially cause a lot of fatalities compared to other organisms. So, we're quite brutal, but. Michael Garfield 34:02:You know, to, to bring up a marvelous work of science fiction, that seems to have some direct bearing on the insights that you just said. I've been in a book club recently discussing the science fiction trilogy Lilith's Brood by Octavia Butler. Should I read this? It's an extraordinary hit. It's a very, very relevant and kind of evergreen piece of work by the first science fiction author to ever become a MacArthur fellow. It just highly awarded a black female science fiction author, you know, just an amazing, amazing mind. Michael Garfield 34:36:And I've been on the tip of trying to read more black Sci-fi right now to get a better understanding of the world spaces disclosed thereby. And in this book, this book is about humans interacting kind of non-consensually with a race of aliens that comes to earth and finds us in the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse. And once they're masters of bioengineering and they want to reboot our planet and nurse humankind and the biosphere back from extinction. Michael Garfield 35:09:But in order to do that, they kind of have to change the rules for human beings. And one of the things that they do is they refuse to give the humans that are going to repopulate earth, any writing materials, like it's part of their thing, that they all have genetically engineered eidetic memory. And so, they would rather engineer us to have perfect recall, then allow us to record history on paper. Eddie Lee 35:37:It sounds like a curse. You know, you know, that, I guess that was the thing for a long period of human history, right? Oral tradition, Homer, obviously, until it was written down. Yeah. What is it that keeps us fighting? Is it, is it literature? And that would be even, there'd be very tragic and somewhat ironic actually, because we're supposed to learn from history. Michael Garfield 36:05:But you know, in this paper, I think it's, like you said, it's the end of the conflict remembers the beginning. Yeah. There's another piece here, which is about the beginning. And I think that this might give us a hinge to get into some discussion about your other work on swing voting, which is really, you know, also very timely and interesting. You and your co authors on this piece, talk about policers or the police macaques. And they're being like thresholds at which they will or will not intervene in order to break up a conflict before it becomes a conflagration. Michael Garfield 36:44:And I'm curious to hear you talk a little bit about how thinking about conflict as a collective computation illuminates, why we may make a choice to mediate a conflict or to de escalate it or to allow it to run its course. Right? Yeah. So, what are your thoughts on all of that? Eddie Lee 37:04:Yeah. Well, first the disclaimer is that I'm not an expert on mechanics society. So, so that, you know, when I talk with Jess later, I can say that I said this, but yeah. So, these police or macaque or high-power individuals that, I mean, you know, in short other macaque don't want to mess with them. So, if they get in a fight, you just don't hit the policer or per usual. So, they're serving some sort of regulatory mechanism and maybe in the sort of conceptual abstract sense, regulatory control is very important in terms of outbreaks and contagion, right? Eddie Lee 37:40:So, for example, for example, and I'm not saying that this is macaque conflict, but you know, if you have a fire or a forest with a lot of dry wood that hasn't been cleared away by previous small conflagrations, you can have a major conflagration, right? So, you have this idea that by preventing all, but the largest of conflagrations you've sort of saved the system, allowing it to renew itself. I'm not saying that that is a macaque conflict, but you could imagine some kind of role, right. That, that a regulator would perform in this sort of society. Eddie Lee 38:13:I don't know what that role is, but definitely one of the ways that it manifests is by preventing these, the largest, you know, outbreaks from happening or an attempt to. And, you know, that is sort of interesting. I don't know what the computational rule of conflict in human society is, but you know, one of the ideas behind some of the models that have been proposed for conflict is actually similar to this forest fire thing, which is that the conditions for conflict will simmer, right? Eddie Lee 38:47:And then when it reaches that boiling point, you can have one and when you have one, it's this big thing. But it depletes the system in a way. And so, you are always poised between never being able to have these big conflicts. I mean, truly massive ones, you know, think world war five and, and having these sort of like smaller conflicts, but I don't know, I don't know what would be, right. Would it be good to prevent all conflicts or would it be bad? Eddie Lee 39:18:Would that sort of lead to some sort of special situation where you suddenly had, you know, the nuclear Armageddon and I don't know, but it is, it is sort of an interesting question to think about, Michael Garfield 39:29:You know, pull in a totally non-scientific perspective on this from a rather sketchy character. I remember Osho Rajneesh, the disgraced guru that brought his cult into Oregon, had a line in one of his books. He said, you know, be aware of the pacifist because they're sitting on a volcano and. And you know, race had, ?? D'Souza just gave one of the flash workshop talks last week on timescales and tradeoffs, where she was talking about this in terms of exactly what you just said about, you know, if you have small forest fires every once in a while, it prevents this big one. Michael Garfield 40:09:So, you know, the question is in our efforts to expunge conflict from the planet. Are we really doing ourselves a long range disservice, are we making a tradeoff That's actually making the system dramatically more brittle than it otherwise would be? And then this starts getting into sort of more archeological or historical perspectives on the role of organized sports as a way of, of, you know, channeling our aggression into something that's less likely to result in. I mean, you might flip a cop car if you win the championship. Eddie Lee 40:42:Well, you know, I don't even know if it has anything to do with human nature, right. It might just be the way that modern society is structured. So, who knows? I mean, I think there's a real question here about what are the conditions required for armed conflict? Why does that happen? And, you know, could you get, could you develop a system where it just doesn't and totally avoid this whole issue? And I think it's actually quite complicated because conflict is associated with so many things. You know what I mean? It's not just like conflict by itself. Eddie Lee 41:13:Conflict comes with famine, comes with disease, comes with poverty, comes with deaths. I mean, you're, you're basically tearing a lot of things apart. So, it's just one side of the coin. And so maybe, you know, it's not pleasers you need, right. Maybe it's something else. Maybe you just need to change how people see one another. Michael Garfield 41:34:Yeah. At risk of being misunderstood as making a political statement here. I've been thinking a lot after talking with Jeff West about his work on, you know, the branching of the circulatory system as being a way of minimizing friction, minimizing turbulence in the bloodstream. And so, if we're going to apply that kind of biophysical scaling law insight to the way that we have established our systems of governance, then the question is, well, what does a truly fractal policing system look like? Michael Garfield 42:06:Because I used to work in festivals and, you know, there is this question of, if someone is trying to get into a fight at a festival, is it really appropriate to call the police? Can this be handled like burning man does with volunteer Rangers that are trained in de-escalation before it becomes a legal issue? And so, you know, this is, I think that your work is really inspiring for anyone who's interested in the conversation around police reform and for, you know, the kind of dynamic governance that I talked about with David in our transmission series about how many layers of modular decision making are necessary in order to get something that is both robust and isn't going to just implode periodically. Eddie Lee 42:54:Right, right. Yeah. I think, I think there were some big questions here, right. That goes far beyond the political issues at play today. Right. I mean, the questions that we're asking about complex systems are big questions about the system and might even question the sort of principles of the system. If you can get sort of a similar outcome with a completely or sorry, a different outcome with a completely different setup, that'd be really interesting. You know, I mean, especially in the context of armed conflict, because it really does seem for at least a couple of hundred years of innate features of the system. Eddie Lee 43:31:I mean what is it about the system that you can change? Can you change it? Is it human nature? Is it our construction and modern society? I think those are questions that haven't been answered and somehow, they're connected to, by the fact that conflict is associated with many of these other things, they're really connected with serious social problems that still have played to human society for a while. So, I think there is a chance here really by digging into one of these aspects, potentially being able to get an understanding of some of these broader social issues. Michael Garfield 44:07:So, this is the place for us to pivot, forgive the pun here into a discussion of the paper that you lead authored for Royal society interface on this is sensitivity of collective outcomes, identifies pivotal components. You know, we're coming up on the presidential election, the conversation around swing voters. And everybody wants to figure out who are the people to target that ended up sending the sand pile down one side of the Hill versus the other, right. Michael Garfield 44:40:So, could you unpack this particular paper and a little bit of the, you know, the sort of fundamental framing that you're doing here and, you know, get into the details on that place. Yeah. Eddie Lee 44:52:So, what we did here was we started with this idea of the median voter. So, the median voters, basically the person who sits in the middle, right, that's a swing better. So, imagine you had a bunch of people, let's imagine the simplest situation where you could just label them left and right. But then there's an odd number of people you decide by majority. And there's the person sending the middle, that's the median voter. Now that's a very simplified situation. And I think many situations are often simplified into this binary choice, which is not the case because there were so many things that actually come into play in a vote and across many votes, actually, right? Eddie Lee 45:31:Right? So, you never just have a median voter. The voter might be immediate on one issue, but not on any others and you might have variation, right? So, imagine that this bill is an obvious left, right? But you want it to pass, you know, what their median is going to do, then you change it. You make a more complex bill with many amendments and so on, right? So, you can play with this in many ways. And so, as a result, you're not really asking, or we weren't really asking what is the median voter, but once we account for all these sorts of potential complexities that manifest in the statistics, how could we identify that person who sort of plays that role more consistently than others? Eddie Lee 46:11:So, a little bit more of a subtle definition of median. And we call these pivotal voters who pivotal components. And this is a very general way of asking the problem, right? So, it's to say that if I were to push and tug on each of these people in different ways, how would the outcome change in the voting system? The outcome is the majority votes or different ways that people couldn't divide up into groups. But again, you can think about this and in different contexts, right? So, Twitter is an example. So, you imagine everyone sort of voting in a different way by choosing to use certain words. Eddie Lee 46:43:So, the vote is not just left or right, but it's whether I used it, I talked about this K-pop idol or this K-pop idol right. So, you make a choice about which community you start to belong to in terms of the words you use. And then we asked, like, if some people were to change their words, would that really substantially change the collective groupings of, of other people? And you can ask a similar question about stocks in that case. It's a little bit less about what you can change, but more of a sort of identification principle, right? Eddie Lee 47:14:Because it's very hard to change. For example, the, what was it, the SNP spider indices, you don't, you don't just go in and change the data. Those are an aggregation of many different things happening. So, it's more, just a sort of a way of understanding how they move with respect to one another. So, we took this sort of generalized idea of a median and try to understand, for example, and in congressional voting or Supreme court voting, could we identify these people that you would want to tug or push? Eddie Lee 47:46:And we actually asked quite a bit, sort of a general question. We didn't ask if there's one person, what if you could control anybody? Right. So, I could pay everybody a bribe, but to go in different directions. And the goal would be to change the outcome as much as possible. And what we found was that in some cases we found certain individuals that seem to matter a lot. And some cases we found that it actually wasn't one individual actually you'd have to sort of control the entire system to change things. Eddie Lee 48:17:And that's sort of interesting because you know, it sorts of hints at this idea of manipulation, right? So, a system where you have to push a lot of different things at once, you have to push all the buttons in different ways, all at the same time, that's hard, that's complex. Whereas if you just paid one guy and you get all the votes your way. Well, great. I know exactly what to do. So, we sort of look for that signal. And I, I guess maybe I'll point out one of the examples that we looked at, which was the Supreme court, and this is not the modern court, this is the Rehnquist, the second run core score, which was from 94 to 2005 when William Rehnquist was a chief justice. Eddie Lee 48:55:And what we found was that the primary signal was not about O'Connor and Kennedy, who are presumably the median voters that matter the most and that's, that's conventional wisdom. And that was really interesting. Right? So, suggest that there's something more complicated going on. I think given some of the work I've done, that's not so surprising, but as it turns out that it's a little bit more subtle, right? It's not that power is totally diffused throughout the court. Eddie Lee 49:26:If you ask whether courts, whether a vote was liberal conservative, and there's some ambiguity here in how you determine whether something is liberal conservative, but sort of pushing those aside for the moment. If you just ask whether the decision was conservative or liberal, and you asked who was the sort of most influential, according to this measure, then you do find O'Connor and Kennedy. So somehow the fact that you can identify them as being important voters hinges on your interpretation of their votes as partisan. Eddie Lee 49:58:If you don't, if you don't, if you forget about the partisan, you just say they voted in these ways, then they don't, they don't seem to be important. So somehow, right, the statistics are telling us something potentially very interesting, which is that influence is not only a measure of the changes that someone can impose, but your interpretation of those changes as well. Michael Garfield 50:23:Gosh, you know, I'm just thinking about this in light of research that was done right before the 2016 us presidential election on search result ranking. I forget who it was that published this, but they were talking about the difference in a news item, making it to the top search result versus the second search result and how they were able to swing by modulating that across the entire population of people actually issuing these searches. Michael Garfield 50:53:They were able to swing electoral results by up to 25% in one direction or the other. And they actually tested this on some mayoral elections in India, where they were able to demonstrate that they were, they were able to throw, and they didn't actually do it. Oh, I was okay with it, it was a retrodiction of results that had happened, like a matter of weeks before. Yeah. But they were, I mean, they basically said, look, you know, the search companies need to be aware that the structure of accountability within these organizations, when you have an opaque algorithm for search results and the company, they can throw somebody under the bus who was working under nondisclosure on the algorithm and say, Oh, this was a rogue agent. Michael Garfield 51:40:We lack effective safeguards in society to prevent this kind of thing from happening because the kind of manipulation at scale that you're talking about does seem possible. Eddie Lee 51:51:Right. So, what you're saying is that it's not just the facts that you give people, but the salience of those facts. Yeah. And that's, that's actually very subtle because, you know, I certainly actually, I, you know, it was just last, was it this past week I heard a talk about this, but I just can't for the gut of me remember, but something about salient being really important for determining how people interpret events around them. Michael Garfield 52:18:So, there's another dimension of this paper, in your discussion on this paper, you're talking about this, not only in terms of voting results, but in the susceptibility of population to disease or disinformation. And so, you know, David and Jeffrey and many other people at SFI have written about, and we, you know, we had Laura Hibbard, the friend and the scarp, you know, on the show also recently talking about cultural contagions. Yeah. And so, I'm trying to wrap my head around how this model could inform a strategy for fighting disinformation in this way. And like, what would that look like? Eddie Lee 53:02:Well, you know, it's, it's kind of hard to make that connection. I think formally because we're looking at the statistics. So, we look over many aggregate dynamics and so on. And I think probably for something like this information who really do want to understand the dynamics of how things are spreading. So, there is that sort of shortcoming, but you could still ask, I think in that context, you know, how changes in the system could result or what changes in the system could result in the largest changes in the outcomes. Eddie Lee 53:35:And I think sort of to do that, you sort of have to rely on the fact we're focusing on this mathematical technique for, for studying the response of a system to perturbation. So, we're asking, we're sort of thinking about that in a statistical sense. It doesn't have to be in a statistical sense, but actually it sort of connects to a really interesting set of ideas of sort of tangential to this. And what it should say is this, this field right, is relying on this idea of information geometry. Eddie Lee 54:07:And what information geometry is about is imagining that if you have some sort of mathematical description of a system, it has to be parameterized. You typically choose parameters in a way that makes sense relative to what you're studying, but you could imagine changing those parameters. And you could imagine an alternate universe where a different sort of dynamics range. And so, this idea is that these models are all connected to one another. If you change the parameters a little bit at a time, eventually you get to those crazy alternative universes, which is totally different. Eddie Lee 54:42:But the path that you take is described by information geometry. And what we say is the curvature of, of that geometry. So how quickly it changes tells us how sensitive the system is, right? So, if I change this parameter a tiny amount and all of a sudden, I am in this alternative universe, then it's highly sensitive. It's highly sensitive to perturbation, right? Whereas if it's totally insensitive, two changes, then this primary almost doesn't matter, right? Eddie Lee 55:14:You basically get the same universe. It's slightly different. Maybe the colors of the cars are not quite the same, but it's almost exactly the same and what it turned out to be the case in a lot of physical models of the world is that, and you have many parameters that actually don't matter. And you have a few parameters that really do. So, for example, in the biology of a cell, you have these sophisticated bottles with tons of parameters that you can never hope to measure. Eddie Lee 55:44:And in fact, you can't really measure them anyway. Okay. But if you plug those values into the mathematical model, you basically get a cell that works. So, this is incredible because you're sometimes off by a hundred percent, 200%, but it's the works. Why it's because the information geometry is actually multi-dimensional and in some directions of parameter space, it's totally flat. So, all of the universes look exactly the same along that dimension. And it's very, very sharp along some other dimensions. So, you have to get some things right. And those things matter a lot, but most things don't matter. Eddie Lee 56:15:And so, this idea that you have this hierarchy of sensitivity, right, is what allows us to understand that the world, because if everything mattered, everything's out the window, you can never do that. You can never understand nature, but the fact that there's a hierarchy means that I can first build a model that sort of right, right. Newton's model or Copernicus's model, it's sort of right. It's not exactly right, but it's good enough that people believe me. And then, you know, Newton comes by and then Einstein comes by. But all of those additional effects features are smaller and smaller. Eddie Lee 56:45:And so that's what I mean by hierarchy of parameters. Right? And so that's what allows us to, well, that's a claim, but you know, that's, that's what makes the universe easy to learn about. And hopefully that is true. Generally. It's not, it's not clear that's true for every complex system, right. Which is why the complex systems are hard, difficult, but what's sort of interesting in the context of pivotal components is if there is such a hierarchy, then it means that this system is easier to control, right? Because you don't need every degree of freedom. Eddie Lee 57:16:So perhaps in order to facilitate diffusion of power, you want to design systems that are completely impossible to control unless you have all the fingers on the right triggers at the right time. Whereas if you want it to be controllable, then you need to design it with this idea in mind. And you can imagine situations where you want A, and you don't want B or you want controllability and you don't want non-controllability. And that's sort of the connection. There's a long-winded way of getting to this connection with, you know, susceptibility in say, disinformation is one might want to ask, how are these systems designed and are they designed in a way that makes them easily manipulated or makes them hard to manipulate? Eddie Lee 58:03:And do you want one or the other? Because you know, it could be that disinformation is really hard to root out when things are very decentralized, right? So, it may actually be a clash of values, right? You may actually want one thing, but it just leads to the wrong thing. Michael Garfield 58:19:I'm reminded of a, was it around the 2004 presidential election? Someone had a video where they taught a chimpanzee to manipulate one of the Diebold voting machines. You know, you can like, you can teach a Chimp to hack this, which brings us back all the way back around to the primate stuff. Yeah. You know, as somebody who has a lifelong abiding interest in both the sort of philosophy around evolutionary theory, as well as time travel fiction, you know, these, what you just described are the two sort of worldviews that you see at war in the debate over evolutionary contingency versus inevitability, you know, it's, it's ultimately, it's a dispute between two different models. Michael Garfield 58:56:Like, do you have Ashton Kutcher's butterfly effect, time travel where every, you know, like you keep changing everything on accident or is it more like back to the future where it only matters who sleeps together? You know, that's, that's, you know, somehow that, you know, the timeline is like completely robust against these perturbations. And so, you know, that's, I guess until we have this figured out, my advice is to like, not get in the DeLorean. Right. I don't know. Well, dude, it's, it's been absolutely wonderful talking with you before we wrapped this. Michael Garfield 59:31:I just an opportunity to tell people a little bit more about what's on your plate right now as a researcher and what you're looking forward to, what are the burning questions for you right now? And, on the horizon, in the months of confinement to come here, Eddie Lee 59:52:Well, I'm, I'm writing the second Principia Mathematica, you know, because people keep saying, you know, this is the time when you really get some work done. And I'm sort of past that now. It's been so many months? Michael Garfield:And it's horrible. Eddie Lee 1:00:12:If you keep telling people you're working on this grand project, nothing comes out while you're still working on it. No, I have, I have several things on my plate right now that are sort of on and off. One thing is sort of extending this armed conflict stuff to start really digging into some of the, sort of maybe contingent factors, but trying to find patterns in the contingencies that unify them. We're also been looking at Jeffrey West Chris campus. And I have been looking at metabolic scaling theory or in the forest. So, trying to understand some of the dynamics that lead to scaling and forest populations and hopefully actually touch on armed conflict in some way. Eddie Lee 1:00:52:I've also been thinking about acquisition of information in firms. So, trying to see why is it that firm lifetimes are distributed in a very sort of regular way, surprisingly across sectors. And does it have to do with how they're learning, how they're acquiring information from around them. I'm finishing a project with Jess and David on adaptation learning and adaptation. And it actually, the idea is that we're thinking about different forms of memory embedded in either the organism in its behavior or in its environment, and trying to unify these various mechanisms or implementations of memory into a sort of optimal adaptation framework. Eddie Lee 1:01:36:I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but it's a lot and, um. Michael Garfield 1:01:39:You don't have to keep fighting it. Right. If you've forgotten it, if you've heard that ??. Eddie Lee 1:01:47:There's no glue, you know, at some point it will lead to some cascading failure. Michael Garfield 1:01:52:Fair enough. Well, yeah, thanks again for being on the show and folks check the show notes for a link to all of your research and the other stuff that we've discussed in here. Eddie Lee 1:02:06:Awesome.

I am not saying that, that is conflict. But you could imagine some kind of rule that a regulator would perform in society. I don’t know what that rule is, but definitely one of the ways it manifests is by preventing the largest outbreaks from happening. Or, an attempt to.And, you know, one of the ideas behind some of the models that have been proposed for conflict is actually similar to this forest fire thing. Which is that, the conditions for conflict will simmer, and when it reaches that boiling, you can have one. And when you have one, it’s this big thing but it depletes the system in a way.And so, you are always poised between never being able to have these big conflicts and having these sorts of having like these smaller conflicts. Would it be good to prevent all conflicts or would it be bad? Would that sort of lead to some sort of special situation where you suddenly had the nuclear Armageddon? I don’t know. [Intro music] 01:00 : Michael Garfield 01:24:Since the 1940s scientists have puzzled over a curious finding. Armed conflict data reveals that human battles obey a power law distribution like avalanches and epidemics. Just like the fractal surfaces of mountains and cauliflowers, the shape of violence looks the same at any level of magnification.Beyond the particulars of why we fight, this pattern suggests a deep hidden order in the physical laws governing society. And digging in the new analysis of data from both armed conflicts and voting patterns, complex systems researchers have started to identify the so-called pivotal components involved. The straw that breaks the camel’s back. The spark that sets the forest fire. The influential but not always famous figures that shape history.Michael Garfield 02:11Can science find a universal theory that predicts the size of conflict from their initial conditions? Or identity key players whose knob society in one direction or another? Welcome to Complexity. The official podcast of the Santé Fe Institute.I am your host Michael Garfield. And each week we’ll bring you with us on far ranging on rigorous researchers developing new frameworks explaining the deepest mysteries of the universe. Michael Garfield 02:39:This week’s guest is SFI program postdoctoral Eddie Lee. Whose work in conflict avalanches and swing voters gives a glimpse of the mysterious forces that determine why we fight. And how we will be able to prevent the next conflagration. In this episode we talk about armed conflict as a fractal and a form of computation. Swing voters in the justice and influencers in pop cultures. And what these studies may have to say about the deep constraints that guide the currents of society. Michael Garfield  03:11:Just a note that this will be our last episode before short summer break to give our scientists uninterrupted time to work on a torrent of new research. We have some exciting episodes scheduled for our return in mid-august.

Well, shall we Eddie Lee 04:25:All right, let's do it. Michael Garfield 04:26:Yeah. Eddie Lee, it is a pleasure to have you here and our first ever in person, socially distanced podcast recording here across my patio. So welcome. Eddie Lee 04:39 :Thanks for having me. This is great. Michael Garfield 04:42 :I'd love to start as we typically do by just providing a little bit of personal background and having you talk a little bit about how you got into science and how you got into specifically an interest in the kind of research that you're doing at SFI and the stuff that we'll be talking about today. Eddie Lee 05:00 :Well, I think it was last week that actually the writer of the magic school bus series passed away. And, you know, I have to say that she really did leave a fantastic legacy and I'm part of that legacy. I grew up on, on the magic school bus and actually some after school science programs as well. So, I sort of had this nascent interest in science for a long time, something I enjoyed doing. I didn't really see myself becoming a scientist. Eddie Lee 05:32:And in fact, when I went to college, I actually tried to become an economics major surprisingly enough, but it turned out that I took this sort of fantastic course called integrated sciences. And it's sort of my preview in a way to complex sciences, because what it was a class telling us, showing us that the way of thinking in computer science, biology, chemistry, physics, we're all coming together in the context of some fascinating problems in biology. Eddie Lee 06:03:So, this idea that all these things were coming together was a really surprising thing for me. And I think what really sort of hit it home was when I read this book by Phillip ball called critical mass. And so, he brought up the aspect of society, also being part of this. And, you know, at some point in my past, I'd also read Isaac Asimov's foundation series, which is, which is the physics of social behavior and prediction. And so somehow all of these things were sort of swirling around in my head. Eddie Lee 06:35:I didn't know what to do about them. And I ended up imagining what I really need to do is go into sociology. So, I went to, I searched around, I'd try to talk with sociology professors. And I just talked with one, I think he was maybe at the head of the Taryn at the time. And he said, you know, I know this guy who might be able to direct you. And he couldn't remember the name, but he started searching online and he showed me the web page. And it was one of the professors who had taught that first class, that first course that I mentioned integrated sciences. Eddie Lee 07:05:So, he sorts of just sent me right back. Yeah. Boomerang style back into that professor's office. And he actually was familiar with SFI. So, he's the one who directed me to talk with Jessica and Dave Cracker, who now I've known for a long time. And that's sort of where all of this stuff started happening. And that's when I started really learning about what sort of science SFI works on and my sort of vague interest in it became, you know, crystallized. Michael Garfield 07:37:Awesome. Well, this is a great place actually, to just dig right in to the first set of papers I wanted to talk with you about today, which you co-authored with David and Jessica, as well as Brian Daniels and Chris Myers on scaling theory for armed conflict avalanches. So this idea that we can use physics insights to understand human social behavior from like an orbital perspective and like really much like in the foundation books, you know, that we can, we can come at the, the sort of vagaries of history from, you know, David would call a rigorous and principled quantitative approach. Michael Garfield 08:23:The history is not just the story of great men making decisions, but that those decisions occur within a landscape of physical constraints. And what are those constraints and how do they manifest themselves? And this is really interesting work and it's got a long history that you're building on. And so maybe the history of this strain of research is the right place to start. And then we can unpack it from there. Eddie Lee 08:48:Sure. Yeah. Like you're saying, it's interesting, but what we weren't focusing on was the particular stories of particular conflicts. And there's a lot to study about any particular conflict they're quite different, right? So, you might think of say the Libyan or Tunisian revolutions happening today, which are quite different from world war two, which were quite different from the British and French battling it out, say in 1812. So, these are all very distinct lines of history in and of their own. Eddie Lee 09:20:And so, what we were interested in was trying to understand whether or not there were universalities common features shared amongst these things that are clearly disparate. And as you were saying, this isn't a completely new idea. It was in 1948 that Louis Fry Richardson showed this amazing feature, which was that when you make a histogram of interstate Wars, so you count how many wars there are with F people that died, F fatalities. And you look at this histogram on a log plot, what you find is a straight line. Eddie Lee 09:54:And what's remarkable about a straight line being on a log plot is that it's, that's a power law. That means its scale free. In other words, sort of most, very naively speaking. If you were to look at a small conflict, it's sort of like a shrunk down version, statistically, speaking of a large conflict and so on and so forth all the way down. And so, this was very strange because interstate wars that you looked at were all quite different from one another. So why would you get this sort of regularity that emerges when you look across many different conflicts? Eddie Lee 10:27:And since then other people have noticed other interesting patterns in the timing of conflicts, as well, as well as terrorism and so on. And what we were interested in was looking for some of these patterns in a more recent dataset, which is called the armed conflict location event, data project, or ACLED for short. And what was remarkable about this data set was that they didn't take all these events, these small disparate individual conflict events that would occur in a war. They didn't group them together into wars. Eddie Lee 11:00:They just sort of disaggregated them into, into small localized defense. And so instead of having to take a quantity, that's already defined for you as a battle or a war or skirmish, or just a local riot, we got to connect these into ourselves, into these clusters of what we called conflict avalanches. So many ways similar to two battles or Wars, but without having assumed some of these connections from using sociopolitical factors. So just looking at the time and spatial patterns of these events, and what we found was that when you look at these conflict avalanches, various measures of their size, so not just how many people died, but how many of these reports did you obtain? Eddie Lee 11:43:How long did it last, how far did it spread? All of these different factors show these characteristic power law tales, like what Richardson saw and what we were able to do beyond that is to show that these pieces were all connected to one another in some mathematical way. And I think I had an analogy for this, which was that if you imagine you walk into a dark room and you're trying to figure out what is this object in front of you? Eddie Lee 12:12:And you find first, there's this sort of rigid pillar. Then you find this long sort of thing with a hairy end. You find this floppy disc, like thing, you start in your mind developing this picture of an elephant. And the way that that works is all these pieces are connected to one another, right? They're pieces of one whole. They're not independent, separate things. And so, you build a model in your head and you say, this must be connected. The legs must be connected to the body, must be connected to the head and so on. Eddie Lee 12:43:So, we did something like that with the mathematics of these various features. And we found that they were self-consistent in a way that seems to point to one sort of object driving the dynamics.  Eddie Lee 12:55:And that's sort of really cool because it suggests that there is some sort of underlying thing that we're just getting hints of. We haven't found it yet. We haven't discovered exactly what it is. Obviously, it's something about war and conflict, but it's perhaps something bigger, right? That leads to universal patterns, across many different types of conflict. Michael Garfield 13:17:So, you draw some analogies in one of the preprints that you've done on this work, emergent regularities and scaling and armed conflict data. You draw analogies to forest fire models, which other researchers have tried to apply to this, to neural avalanches. And, you know, just from last week's episode with the SFI counter speech team and the network graphs that you see of the Twitter data that they've harvested, and the way that you see these conversations, these sort of battles between hate speech, organized, hate speech groups and organized counter speech groups on Twitter. Michael Garfield 13:56:And this look also like these, you know, you see these the sort of conflagration of point by point debate breaking out when there's a successful, an actual collision, rather than just the hate group eliciting engagement to its original post. But people are actually willing to go into the trenches with one another on social media. And so, I would love to hear you talk a little bit more specifically about this model as a, like a branching network diagram. Michael Garfield 14:26:Yeah. There's some really interesting figures, and we'll link to this stuff in the show notes so that people can, can actually get a look at what we're talking about here. Because it actually looks rather menacing. Eddie Lee 14:39:That's why we chose those colors. Michael Garfield 14:41:The map of a branching armed conflict here. Eddie Lee 14:44:Yeah. So, cascades are a real central conceptual foundation for understanding a lot of these different kinds of phenomena. And as you mentioned, if you look at neural activity in the cortex, what you find are, are these cascades of activity, and it's not just a bunch of neurons firing, you can actually trace it out to some sort of branching process. So, you imagine there's the center, the first neuron that activates other neurons, which activate other neurons and so on sort of in a conflagration type picture. Eddie Lee 15:24:And you can also think about various other phenomena with this sort of conceptual framework. So, forest fires are another way, right? So, you imagine you have a bunch of sorts of local clusters of maybe dried out patches of trees and you have a spark, maybe some lightning strikes, and then it sort of burns its way through all these connected clusters. And you can think about that analogy applying to, to social contagion as well. And so that's why we sort of started with this idea of thinking about conflict in the same way. Eddie Lee 15:55:And mathematically, it's a very generic way of thinking about it, right? All of that you need are different pieces that are connected to one another in this sort of branching way. And so, you can get this exponential increase. Actually, this is very relevant in the context of today with COVID right? So, when people talk about exponentially growing processes, this is exactly what they mean. Or you have someone who spreads it to some other people. And if each person on average spreads up to more than one person, then you have an explosion. So, we sort of were playing with this framework and thinking about conflict in this way as a social contagion. Eddie Lee 16:29:And we're not sure if that's exactly how it spreads, but we can at least say that the way that it spreads is consistent with this idea of the way that it spreads both across space, as well as across time and in size. Michael Garfield 16:46:So, this elicits for me, links back to this sort of giant network model and building of this, these conversations on the show with all of the other conversations that hopefully we'll publish in the SFI press one day and make a poster. This reminds me a lot of, of two things. One is the conversations I just had with Jeffrey West a few episodes ago, where he was talking about biophysical scaling laws as being extremely coarse and like not actually capturing all of the variation that we would see in like specific evolutionary instances. The Primo example, being that human beings, modern humans use something like 30 times more energetic resources than we would expect from mammals of this size. Michael Garfield 17:33:Because as we've talked about with David and some of the transmission episodes, the human being is basically just the visible corner of this hyper object now. And then each of us is actually like a cyborg spanning the globe with all of these electronic augmentations. Right? So, something like that is going on in this work with conflict. And when you actually peer into the data with a little bit more granularity, you see a lot of variation in this, not enough to challenge the thesis, but enough to suggest that there are some interesting details about the regional and temporal variations of these conflicts. Michael Garfield 18:14:And I would love to hear you talk about that. And then also just to like make this kind of unwieldy let's pin onto that since you brought up COVID, Chris Morris piece for the transmission series, where you talking about super spreader and that's and how the, you know, our zero as a measure of the transmissibility of a disease, doesn't actually tell you what's going on in that particular church or in that particular campus building or, you know, so there's. So, what are the features about the data set that you've noticed that seemed to be providing insights into why there's variations in the size of these conflicts around that mean. Eddie Lee 18:56:No, that's, that's great. I mean, I think it's really important to point out that a lot of this work 's goal isn't to explain all this variation, which, you know, eventually we want to do, but it's really to talk about the shared common features across all of these phenomena. And then of course it's important to mention that, that's the only thing it explains. And so, the features that I'm talking about in terms of scaling are the averages, but you can have scaling in the variation as well. Eddie Lee 19:29:And that's, that's really interesting. And as you mentioned, right, you know, Chris Moore wrote that very nice piece where it's really important to mention that are not, is an average and not necessarily going to tell you what's happening in a very particular location. And that's also exactly true for theories about metabolic scaling in force or conflict. And in fact, it turns out that that sort of variation manifests directly in our work looking at conflict. Eddie Lee 20:02:And one of the things that we find is that it's not only essential to account for the similarities between how conflict grows in different locations, but there's also variation in terms of this sort of coefficient in front of it. So, the way that it grows the shape of the curve may be similar, but the offset of that curve may be different. And that might depend on factors such as prosperity or governance. So, here's one example, right? So, you look at Eastern Somalia, weak governance, a lot of widespread poverty and a huge amount of conflict. Eddie Lee 20:36:One of the hot zones in this and the status set. But if you look at South Africa, it's quite prosperous, they have a pretty strong government and its relatively low levels of conflict. So even if it's the case, that conflict evolves in a similar way, you just don't expect to see as much conflict and South Africa, as you see in Eastern Somalia. And so, as you also said, these things will vary in time. So hopefully Eastern Somalia is not a hotspot forever, but maybe somewhere else will become one. So, there may be patterns also in the diversity of hot zones. Eddie Lee 21:09:And we see a hint of this. We can't say that will be the case forever because we only look at 20 years. But one of the sort of fascinating things is that Richardson, who I mentioned earlier, looked at wars between, I think, early 1800s and mid-1900s. And he found basically the same statistics. Aaron?? looked at the statistics all the way from Richardson's asset up to today and found the same statistics. So, there's some sort of weird preservation of conflict despite changing technology, different countries. And, and so on that either, I don't know, is, should you be amazed or should you be afraid?  Michael Garfield 21:47:Well, I mean, again, two things come up here, right? One is Jen Dunn's work on food webs and how the structure of these food webs that their patterns of connectivity have been amazingly well-preserved conserved in there, in their form for like the last 500 million years as we've gone through all of these regimes in what is actually living in the oceans. So that's part of it, you know, and that's, that's sort of begs the question that I asked Brian Arthur, which is, do you think that we can use these models as a way of predicting like basins for future innovation, you know, and like predicting areas where we can expect potentially larger conflicts than we're seeing. Michael Garfield 22:30:And then the other piece of it is, bringing in the geopolitical component, Peter Turchin's work. When we're talking about a quantitative study of history and his writing on what he called the double helix of inequality and social instability, where he saw that they were very strongly negatively correlated over the last a hundred or 150 years. But, you know, you make a point in this paper that there are other geopolitical and geographic features that have to do with the coastlines and national borders and locations of these conflicts relative to large urban centers' populations. Michael Garfield 23:11:Yeah. So, I, again, I know that this is sort of beyond the scope of the paper, but I'm really curious, you know, what other, what other factors you think are playing into this and how that might be guiding your follow-up research in this area? Eddie Lee 23:23:I think what you can say is despite the fact that there are a lot of these universal patterns that we think we find is that there's a lot of work trying to understand the mechanisms behind why these patterns might appear. And I think there is yet a connection to be made there. And that would be sort of, I think the Holy grail for, for this sort of work is really understanding those connections and flushing them out. Eddie Lee 23:53:And somehow, they lie in the intersection of maybe social mobility, social prosperity, economic prosperity, technology, geography, right. You can't really fight someone if there's no one there, Michael Garfield 24:08:Tell that to our Facebook group. Eddie Lee 24:13:Yeah. I guess you could make up stories and so on, but there are a lot of different factors that somehow mashed together to generate these patterns. But as you were mentioning, Jen Dunn's work. That's not necessarily to say that you can't get universal patterns from that. So, you know, this is maybe too simple of an example, but one sort of that comes to mind right now, which is the central limit theorem, right? There are many reasons for why you get random likes statistics, right? Eddie Lee 24:46:Many different ways of generating them, but by virtue of their randomness, you end up getting some sort of regularity. So, we'll see. Maybe it's the fact that there are so many factors that do influence conflict that ended up getting simplification at higher scales, or maybe not, maybe, maybe it is contingent. And we, we just don't have enough granularity in our understanding to access that contingency Michael Garfield 25:15:Later on, in this paper, you talked about there being, you know, getting into this granularity, you say: "Unlike canonical cascade models, conflict also includes lattice style dynamics that evolve with geographic spread. The suppression of these dynamics away from the core could reflect social processes or geography that impact conflict evolution. Furthermore, our model suggests conflict is not only the result of local correlations and activity, but also regional and temporal disorder, perhaps reflecting memory of the severity of initiating events". Michael Garfield 25:47:So, this links directly to another paper that you wrote with Brian, David and Jessica on primate conflicts and temporal scaling collapse. And the idea, you know, Jessica's work on primate conflicts as a form of collective computation and the severity of those conflicts having to do with various factors that are performing computations at the level of like an entire primate troupe, right? So, this notion that the patterns that you're seeing in conflict data, that they hinge on there being certain evolutionary reasons for the distribution of conflict, duration, and severity is really interesting. I'm curious to hear you talk a little bit about this other paper and how it links in. Eddie Lee 26:36:Right. No, that's, that's interesting. Right? What are the functional properties of conflict, right? Is there a reason why conflict plays out the way that it does? It's hard to say for human conflicts. Obviously, there are reasons why people give for starting wars. But in monkey conflict, there's potentially one reason which is, has to do with a social hierarchy, right? So, you need to have a little bit of disorder and conflict in order to establish people's roles and where they sit. Eddie Lee 27:07:And the severity of the conflict at the same time cannot be too, too big, right. If it's too severe, it's actually detrimental to society. So, there's this idea that maybe what conflicts does is it serves an information gathering acquisition role, as long as it's not too bad, Michael Garfield 27:26:People have to survive, remember. Eddie Lee 27:28:Exactly. If you don't, if you know, if it's nuclear Armageddon again and that's it, we should remember that. But, I think one of the things that we were trying to study in that work was characterizing the features of monkey conflict and perhaps extracting from those features a potential functional role that, that these things, or these observations could, could conserve. Eddie Lee 27:53:And actually, what's really interesting about the monkey conflict is we studied a group, a society of ??. What we found was that the duration that conflicts lasted well, beta distribution, it was not a parallel distribution like human conflict, but how long they lasted that distribution of duration seemed to be a distribution that looked the same, whether you looked at small conflicts or large complex. And it's very strange because conflicts with 2 monkeys are not the same thing as conflicts with 10 monkeys. Eddie Lee 28:24:There are many more ways they can interact. There are many other things that could happen, go wrong. And so, this was very curious. And so what we found was that if you could think of these conflicts as being sort of the time for all the pairs to resolve their differences, and each of those pairs, or took some amount of time to resolve their differences, then you could get something similar to what we found in the data with the condition that the pairs that resolve their differences later remembered the sort of intensity with which the pairs resolved their differences earlier. Eddie Lee 29:03:So, in other words, if the fight started off with some intense pairwise interactions, like, you know, you bit me, how could you bite me? And that's, that's actually very apparently a very aggressive interaction that the other monkeys will not tolerate. Michael Garfield 29:18:I remember preschool. Yeah. Eddie Lee 29:19:And so, you end up having these long correlations from the beginning to the end, and if that's true, then you end up getting these, these sort of long tails of conflict duration. So, you have many conflicts that tend to last longer. And for us, when we, that was an indication of what we call collective memory, right. This idea that the entire duration of the conflict from beginning to end, some remember at the beginning. And that's what we mean by we say in that paper. Michael Garfield 30:00:Well, okay. So, you know, this, I have the luxury here of kind of like going out on the plank and speculating. Yeah. But this seems to be possibly why certain human conflicts are just insane, like the Hatfield’s and McCoy’s, you know, that the feud has a sort of durability built into it because of the way that the history of a family is prioritized. And like the, you know, the bigger the conflict gets, it would seem like certainly there are factors that are keeping resolution that are like forestalling resolution, but on the other hand, the more abstract the conflict becomes for people, the easier it is to get over. Michael Garfield 30:45:Right. So, you know, this, this is sort of like, you know, I wonder what this approach to understanding this might have to say to, or link with other work on the way that conflict between human beings has changed as war has become industrialized and has been more and more about foreign conflicts rather than defending your own, your Athens or whatever. From there are certain things that would seem to be kind of holding us in the United States in a position of kind of unending foreign Wars. Eddie Lee 31:20:Right. Well, I think it's a little bit unfair to say that these Wars are external. Right. For many people, these Wars are personal, right? Yeah. And that's their life, but sort of touching on this, on this question of, you know, how is it that conflict persists or why is it that conflict persists? I think one thing we suspect from looking at these patterns is that these memories, these core correlations in a conflict, are expressed not only in the history that people maintain about themselves, but also in the geography of how it spreads. Eddie Lee31:57:So, it's quite possible that what encodes the history of the conflict is not just what we think right, the stories that we tell ourselves, but potentially also factors of the environment. Structures that we build. And some of these structures are really obvious, right. I mean, we built the nuclear arsenal, right. It's going to be there. Right. This is really interesting to me, it sort of connects to some of the work that David, Jess and I have been doing recently with adaptation and outsourcing a memory into the environment. Eddie Lee 32:30:Right. Which is this idea that there are biological organisms that intentionally or use and manipulate the environment to couple their bad memory or the behavior with longer timescales that they need in order to better adapt. So, ants do this by building these trails. It's unlikely that individual ants can really remember what they're doing, but over the collective activity of many, they can establish these very long-lived persistent trails. And they can use this trail to harness resources. Michael Garfield: like Google calendar. Eddie Lee 33:01:Exactly. No, I mean, let me do exactly the same thing, right. I mean, David has that example of the notepad, right? Multiply three times, six times, five times, 2,374. I can't do it in my head, but give me a piece of paper. I can just, basically you short term memory expressed on paper to do that calculation very efficiently. And in addition to opening up new ways of doing that calculation, that aren't accessible in my head to myself. So, there is this question, right? Sort of going back to the functional properties of armed conflict, you know, what purpose does armed conflict solve? Eddie Lee 33:32:Are there ways that we are sort of driving our conflict ourselves by embedding into our environment that we don't know of, that we do know of. And I don't think those questions are necessarily answered. At least I haven't seen those answers, but would be really interesting to think about, I mean, right, this is just one other phenomenon in nature, right? It's not just us that fight. We do fight with certain technologies and armed human conflicts or especially cause a lot of fatalities compared to other organisms. So, we're quite brutal, but. Michael Garfield 34:02:You know, to, to bring up a marvelous work of science fiction, that seems to have some direct bearing on the insights that you just said. I've been in a book club recently discussing the science fiction trilogy Lilith's Brood by Octavia Butler. Should I read this? It's an extraordinary hit. It's a very, very relevant and kind of evergreen piece of work by the first science fiction author to ever become a MacArthur fellow. It just highly awarded a black female science fiction author, you know, just an amazing, amazing mind. Michael Garfield 34:36:And I've been on the tip of trying to read more black Sci-fi right now to get a better understanding of the world spaces disclosed thereby. And in this book, this book is about humans interacting kind of non-consensually with a race of aliens that comes to earth and finds us in the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse. And once they're masters of bioengineering and they want to reboot our planet and nurse humankind and the biosphere back from extinction. Michael Garfield 35:09:But in order to do that, they kind of have to change the rules for human beings. And one of the things that they do is they refuse to give the humans that are going to repopulate earth, any writing materials, like it's part of their thing, that they all have genetically engineered eidetic memory. And so, they would rather engineer us to have perfect recall, then allow us to record history on paper. Eddie Lee 35:37:It sounds like a curse. You know, you know, that, I guess that was the thing for a long period of human history, right? Oral tradition, Homer, obviously, until it was written down. Yeah. What is it that keeps us fighting? Is it, is it literature? And that would be even, there'd be very tragic and somewhat ironic actually, because we're supposed to learn from history. Michael Garfield 36:05:But you know, in this paper, I think it's, like you said, it's the end of the conflict remembers the beginning. Yeah. There's another piece here, which is about the beginning. And I think that this might give us a hinge to get into some discussion about your other work on swing voting, which is really, you know, also very timely and interesting. You and your co authors on this piece, talk about policers or the police macaques. And they're being like thresholds at which they will or will not intervene in order to break up a conflict before it becomes a conflagration. Michael Garfield 36:44:And I'm curious to hear you talk a little bit about how thinking about conflict as a collective computation illuminates, why we may make a choice to mediate a conflict or to de escalate it or to allow it to run its course. Right? Yeah. So, what are your thoughts on all of that? Eddie Lee 37:04:Yeah. Well, first the disclaimer is that I'm not an expert on mechanics society. So, so that, you know, when I talk with Jess later, I can say that I said this, but yeah. So, these police or macaque or high-power individuals that, I mean, you know, in short other macaque don't want to mess with them. So, if they get in a fight, you just don't hit the policer or per usual. So, they're serving some sort of regulatory mechanism and maybe in the sort of conceptual abstract sense, regulatory control is very important in terms of outbreaks and contagion, right? Eddie Lee 37:40:So, for example, for example, and I'm not saying that this is macaque conflict, but you know, if you have a fire or a forest with a lot of dry wood that hasn't been cleared away by previous small conflagrations, you can have a major conflagration, right? So, you have this idea that by preventing all, but the largest of conflagrations you've sort of saved the system, allowing it to renew itself. I'm not saying that that is a macaque conflict, but you could imagine some kind of role, right. That, that a regulator would perform in this sort of society. Eddie Lee 38:13:I don't know what that role is, but definitely one of the ways that it manifests is by preventing these, the largest, you know, outbreaks from happening or an attempt to. And, you know, that is sort of interesting. I don't know what the computational rule of conflict in human society is, but you know, one of the ideas behind some of the models that have been proposed for conflict is actually similar to this forest fire thing, which is that the conditions for conflict will simmer, right? Eddie Lee 38:47:And then when it reaches that boiling point, you can have one and when you have one, it's this big thing. But it depletes the system in a way. And so, you are always poised between never being able to have these big conflicts. I mean, truly massive ones, you know, think world war five and, and having these sort of like smaller conflicts, but I don't know, I don't know what would be, right. Would it be good to prevent all conflicts or would it be bad? Eddie Lee 39:18:Would that sort of lead to some sort of special situation where you suddenly had, you know, the nuclear Armageddon and I don't know, but it is, it is sort of an interesting question to think about, Michael Garfield 39:29:You know, pull in a totally non-scientific perspective on this from a rather sketchy character. I remember Osho Rajneesh, the disgraced guru that brought his cult into Oregon, had a line in one of his books. He said, you know, be aware of the pacifist because they're sitting on a volcano and. And you know, race had, ?? D'Souza just gave one of the flash workshop talks last week on timescales and tradeoffs, where she was talking about this in terms of exactly what you just said about, you know, if you have small forest fires every once in a while, it prevents this big one. Michael Garfield 40:09:So, you know, the question is in our efforts to expunge conflict from the planet. Are we really doing ourselves a long range disservice, are we making a tradeoff That's actually making the system dramatically more brittle than it otherwise would be? And then this starts getting into sort of more archeological or historical perspectives on the role of organized sports as a way of, of, you know, channeling our aggression into something that's less likely to result in. I mean, you might flip a cop car if you win the championship. Eddie Lee 40:42:Well, you know, I don't even know if it has anything to do with human nature, right. It might just be the way that modern society is structured. So, who knows? I mean, I think there's a real question here about what are the conditions required for armed conflict? Why does that happen? And, you know, could you get, could you develop a system where it just doesn't and totally avoid this whole issue? And I think it's actually quite complicated because conflict is associated with so many things. You know what I mean? It's not just like conflict by itself. Eddie Lee 41:13:Conflict comes with famine, comes with disease, comes with poverty, comes with deaths. I mean, you're, you're basically tearing a lot of things apart. So, it's just one side of the coin. And so maybe, you know, it's not pleasers you need, right. Maybe it's something else. Maybe you just need to change how people see one another. Michael Garfield 41:34:Yeah. At risk of being misunderstood as making a political statement here. I've been thinking a lot after talking with Jeff West about his work on, you know, the branching of the circulatory system as being a way of minimizing friction, minimizing turbulence in the bloodstream. And so, if we're going to apply that kind of biophysical scaling law insight to the way that we have established our systems of governance, then the question is, well, what does a truly fractal policing system look like? Michael Garfield 42:06:Because I used to work in festivals and, you know, there is this question of, if someone is trying to get into a fight at a festival, is it really appropriate to call the police? Can this be handled like burning man does with volunteer Rangers that are trained in de-escalation before it becomes a legal issue? And so, you know, this is, I think that your work is really inspiring for anyone who's interested in the conversation around police reform and for, you know, the kind of dynamic governance that I talked about with David in our transmission series about how many layers of modular decision making are necessary in order to get something that is both robust and isn't going to just implode periodically. Eddie Lee 42:54:Right, right. Yeah. I think, I think there were some big questions here, right. That goes far beyond the political issues at play today. Right. I mean, the questions that we're asking about complex systems are big questions about the system and might even question the sort of principles of the system. If you can get sort of a similar outcome with a completely or sorry, a different outcome with a completely different setup, that'd be really interesting. You know, I mean, especially in the context of armed conflict, because it really does seem for at least a couple of hundred years of innate features of the system. Eddie Lee 43:31:I mean what is it about the system that you can change? Can you change it? Is it human nature? Is it our construction and modern society? I think those are questions that haven't been answered and somehow, they're connected to, by the fact that conflict is associated with many of these other things, they're really connected with serious social problems that still have played to human society for a while. So, I think there is a chance here really by digging into one of these aspects, potentially being able to get an understanding of some of these broader social issues. Michael Garfield 44:07:So, this is the place for us to pivot, forgive the pun here into a discussion of the paper that you lead authored for Royal society interface on this is sensitivity of collective outcomes, identifies pivotal components. You know, we're coming up on the presidential election, the conversation around swing voters. And everybody wants to figure out who are the people to target that ended up sending the sand pile down one side of the Hill versus the other, right. Michael Garfield 44:40:So, could you unpack this particular paper and a little bit of the, you know, the sort of fundamental framing that you're doing here and, you know, get into the details on that place. Yeah. Eddie Lee 44:52:So, what we did here was we started with this idea of the median voter. So, the median voters, basically the person who sits in the middle, right, that's a swing better. So, imagine you had a bunch of people, let's imagine the simplest situation where you could just label them left and right. But then there's an odd number of people you decide by majority. And there's the person sending the middle, that's the median voter. Now that's a very simplified situation. And I think many situations are often simplified into this binary choice, which is not the case because there were so many things that actually come into play in a vote and across many votes, actually, right? Eddie Lee 45:31:Right? So, you never just have a median voter. The voter might be immediate on one issue, but not on any others and you might have variation, right? So, imagine that this bill is an obvious left, right? But you want it to pass, you know, what their median is going to do, then you change it. You make a more complex bill with many amendments and so on, right? So, you can play with this in many ways. And so, as a result, you're not really asking, or we weren't really asking what is the median voter, but once we account for all these sorts of potential complexities that manifest in the statistics, how could we identify that person who sort of plays that role more consistently than others? Eddie Lee 46:11:So, a little bit more of a subtle definition of median. And we call these pivotal voters who pivotal components. And this is a very general way of asking the problem, right? So, it's to say that if I were to push and tug on each of these people in different ways, how would the outcome change in the voting system? The outcome is the majority votes or different ways that people couldn't divide up into groups. But again, you can think about this and in different contexts, right? So, Twitter is an example. So, you imagine everyone sort of voting in a different way by choosing to use certain words. Eddie Lee 46:43:So, the vote is not just left or right, but it's whether I used it, I talked about this K-pop idol or this K-pop idol right. So, you make a choice about which community you start to belong to in terms of the words you use. And then we asked, like, if some people were to change their words, would that really substantially change the collective groupings of, of other people? And you can ask a similar question about stocks in that case. It's a little bit less about what you can change, but more of a sort of identification principle, right? Eddie Lee 47:14:Because it's very hard to change. For example, the, what was it, the SNP spider indices, you don't, you don't just go in and change the data. Those are an aggregation of many different things happening. So, it's more, just a sort of a way of understanding how they move with respect to one another. So, we took this sort of generalized idea of a median and try to understand, for example, and in congressional voting or Supreme court voting, could we identify these people that you would want to tug or push? Eddie Lee 47:46:And we actually asked quite a bit, sort of a general question. We didn't ask if there's one person, what if you could control anybody? Right. So, I could pay everybody a bribe, but to go in different directions. And the goal would be to change the outcome as much as possible. And what we found was that in some cases we found certain individuals that seem to matter a lot. And some cases we found that it actually wasn't one individual actually you'd have to sort of control the entire system to change things. Eddie Lee 48:17:And that's sort of interesting because you know, it sorts of hints at this idea of manipulation, right? So, a system where you have to push a lot of different things at once, you have to push all the buttons in different ways, all at the same time, that's hard, that's complex. Whereas if you just paid one guy and you get all the votes your way. Well, great. I know exactly what to do. So, we sort of look for that signal. And I, I guess maybe I'll point out one of the examples that we looked at, which was the Supreme court, and this is not the modern court, this is the Rehnquist, the second run core score, which was from 94 to 2005 when William Rehnquist was a chief justice. Eddie Lee 48:55:And what we found was that the primary signal was not about O'Connor and Kennedy, who are presumably the median voters that matter the most and that's, that's conventional wisdom. And that was really interesting. Right? So, suggest that there's something more complicated going on. I think given some of the work I've done, that's not so surprising, but as it turns out that it's a little bit more subtle, right? It's not that power is totally diffused throughout the court. Eddie Lee 49:26:If you ask whether courts, whether a vote was liberal conservative, and there's some ambiguity here in how you determine whether something is liberal conservative, but sort of pushing those aside for the moment. If you just ask whether the decision was conservative or liberal, and you asked who was the sort of most influential, according to this measure, then you do find O'Connor and Kennedy. So somehow the fact that you can identify them as being important voters hinges on your interpretation of their votes as partisan. Eddie Lee 49:58:If you don't, if you don't, if you forget about the partisan, you just say they voted in these ways, then they don't, they don't seem to be important. So somehow, right, the statistics are telling us something potentially very interesting, which is that influence is not only a measure of the changes that someone can impose, but your interpretation of those changes as well. Michael Garfield 50:23:Gosh, you know, I'm just thinking about this in light of research that was done right before the 2016 us presidential election on search result ranking. I forget who it was that published this, but they were talking about the difference in a news item, making it to the top search result versus the second search result and how they were able to swing by modulating that across the entire population of people actually issuing these searches. Michael Garfield 50:53:They were able to swing electoral results by up to 25% in one direction or the other. And they actually tested this on some mayoral elections in India, where they were able to demonstrate that they were, they were able to throw, and they didn't actually do it. Oh, I was okay with it, it was a retrodiction of results that had happened, like a matter of weeks before. Yeah. But they were, I mean, they basically said, look, you know, the search companies need to be aware that the structure of accountability within these organizations, when you have an opaque algorithm for search results and the company, they can throw somebody under the bus who was working under nondisclosure on the algorithm and say, Oh, this was a rogue agent. Michael Garfield 51:40:We lack effective safeguards in society to prevent this kind of thing from happening because the kind of manipulation at scale that you're talking about does seem possible. Eddie Lee 51:51:Right. So, what you're saying is that it's not just the facts that you give people, but the salience of those facts. Yeah. And that's, that's actually very subtle because, you know, I certainly actually, I, you know, it was just last, was it this past week I heard a talk about this, but I just can't for the gut of me remember, but something about salient being really important for determining how people interpret events around them. Michael Garfield 52:18:So, there's another dimension of this paper, in your discussion on this paper, you're talking about this, not only in terms of voting results, but in the susceptibility of population to disease or disinformation. And so, you know, David and Jeffrey and many other people at SFI have written about, and we, you know, we had Laura Hibbard, the friend and the scarp, you know, on the show also recently talking about cultural contagions. Yeah. And so, I'm trying to wrap my head around how this model could inform a strategy for fighting disinformation in this way. And like, what would that look like? Eddie Lee 53:02:Well, you know, it's, it's kind of hard to make that connection. I think formally because we're looking at the statistics. So, we look over many aggregate dynamics and so on. And I think probably for something like this information who really do want to understand the dynamics of how things are spreading. So, there is that sort of shortcoming, but you could still ask, I think in that context, you know, how changes in the system could result or what changes in the system could result in the largest changes in the outcomes. Eddie Lee 53:35:And I think sort of to do that, you sort of have to rely on the fact we're focusing on this mathematical technique for, for studying the response of a system to perturbation. So, we're asking, we're sort of thinking about that in a statistical sense. It doesn't have to be in a statistical sense, but actually it sort of connects to a really interesting set of ideas of sort of tangential to this. And what it should say is this, this field right, is relying on this idea of information geometry. Eddie Lee 54:07:And what information geometry is about is imagining that if you have some sort of mathematical description of a system, it has to be parameterized. You typically choose parameters in a way that makes sense relative to what you're studying, but you could imagine changing those parameters. And you could imagine an alternate universe where a different sort of dynamics range. And so, this idea is that these models are all connected to one another. If you change the parameters a little bit at a time, eventually you get to those crazy alternative universes, which is totally different. Eddie Lee 54:42:But the path that you take is described by information geometry. And what we say is the curvature of, of that geometry. So how quickly it changes tells us how sensitive the system is, right? So, if I change this parameter a tiny amount and all of a sudden, I am in this alternative universe, then it's highly sensitive. It's highly sensitive to perturbation, right? Whereas if it's totally insensitive, two changes, then this primary almost doesn't matter, right? Eddie Lee 55:14:You basically get the same universe. It's slightly different. Maybe the colors of the cars are not quite the same, but it's almost exactly the same and what it turned out to be the case in a lot of physical models of the world is that, and you have many parameters that actually don't matter. And you have a few parameters that really do. So, for example, in the biology of a cell, you have these sophisticated bottles with tons of parameters that you can never hope to measure. Eddie Lee 55:44:And in fact, you can't really measure them anyway. Okay. But if you plug those values into the mathematical model, you basically get a cell that works. So, this is incredible because you're sometimes off by a hundred percent, 200%, but it's the works. Why it's because the information geometry is actually multi-dimensional and in some directions of parameter space, it's totally flat. So, all of the universes look exactly the same along that dimension. And it's very, very sharp along some other dimensions. So, you have to get some things right. And those things matter a lot, but most things don't matter. Eddie Lee 56:15:And so, this idea that you have this hierarchy of sensitivity, right, is what allows us to understand that the world, because if everything mattered, everything's out the window, you can never do that. You can never understand nature, but the fact that there's a hierarchy means that I can first build a model that sort of right, right. Newton's model or Copernicus's model, it's sort of right. It's not exactly right, but it's good enough that people believe me. And then, you know, Newton comes by and then Einstein comes by. But all of those additional effects features are smaller and smaller. Eddie Lee 56:45:And so that's what I mean by hierarchy of parameters. Right? And so that's what allows us to, well, that's a claim, but you know, that's, that's what makes the universe easy to learn about. And hopefully that is true. Generally. It's not, it's not clear that's true for every complex system, right. Which is why the complex systems are hard, difficult, but what's sort of interesting in the context of pivotal components is if there is such a hierarchy, then it means that this system is easier to control, right? Because you don't need every degree of freedom. Eddie Lee 57:16:So perhaps in order to facilitate diffusion of power, you want to design systems that are completely impossible to control unless you have all the fingers on the right triggers at the right time. Whereas if you want it to be controllable, then you need to design it with this idea in mind. And you can imagine situations where you want A, and you don't want B or you want controllability and you don't want non-controllability. And that's sort of the connection. There's a long-winded way of getting to this connection with, you know, susceptibility in say, disinformation is one might want to ask, how are these systems designed and are they designed in a way that makes them easily manipulated or makes them hard to manipulate? Eddie Lee 58:03:And do you want one or the other? Because you know, it could be that disinformation is really hard to root out when things are very decentralized, right? So, it may actually be a clash of values, right? You may actually want one thing, but it just leads to the wrong thing. Michael Garfield 58:19:I'm reminded of a, was it around the 2004 presidential election? Someone had a video where they taught a chimpanzee to manipulate one of the Diebold voting machines. You know, you can like, you can teach a Chimp to hack this, which brings us back all the way back around to the primate stuff. Yeah. You know, as somebody who has a lifelong abiding interest in both the sort of philosophy around evolutionary theory, as well as time travel fiction, you know, these, what you just described are the two sort of worldviews that you see at war in the debate over evolutionary contingency versus inevitability, you know, it's, it's ultimately, it's a dispute between two different models. Michael Garfield 58:56:Like, do you have Ashton Kutcher's butterfly effect, time travel where every, you know, like you keep changing everything on accident or is it more like back to the future where it only matters who sleeps together? You know, that's, that's, you know, somehow that, you know, the timeline is like completely robust against these perturbations. And so, you know, that's, I guess until we have this figured out, my advice is to like, not get in the DeLorean. Right. I don't know. Well, dude, it's, it's been absolutely wonderful talking with you before we wrapped this. Michael Garfield 59:31:I just an opportunity to tell people a little bit more about what's on your plate right now as a researcher and what you're looking forward to, what are the burning questions for you right now? And, on the horizon, in the months of confinement to come here, Eddie Lee 59:52:Well, I'm, I'm writing the second Principia Mathematica, you know, because people keep saying, you know, this is the time when you really get some work done. And I'm sort of past that now. It's been so many months? Michael Garfield:And it's horrible. Eddie Lee 1:00:12:If you keep telling people you're working on this grand project, nothing comes out while you're still working on it. No, I have, I have several things on my plate right now that are sort of on and off. One thing is sort of extending this armed conflict stuff to start really digging into some of the, sort of maybe contingent factors, but trying to find patterns in the contingencies that unify them. We're also been looking at Jeffrey West Chris campus. And I have been looking at metabolic scaling theory or in the forest. So, trying to understand some of the dynamics that lead to scaling and forest populations and hopefully actually touch on armed conflict in some way. Eddie Lee 1:00:52:I've also been thinking about acquisition of information in firms. So, trying to see why is it that firm lifetimes are distributed in a very sort of regular way, surprisingly across sectors. And does it have to do with how they're learning, how they're acquiring information from around them. I'm finishing a project with Jess and David on adaptation learning and adaptation. And it actually, the idea is that we're thinking about different forms of memory embedded in either the organism in its behavior or in its environment, and trying to unify these various mechanisms or implementations of memory into a sort of optimal adaptation framework. Eddie Lee 1:01:36:I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but it's a lot and, um. Michael Garfield 1:01:39:You don't have to keep fighting it. Right. If you've forgotten it, if you've heard that ??. Eddie Lee 1:01:47:There's no glue, you know, at some point it will lead to some cascading failure. Michael Garfield 1:01:52:Fair enough. Well, yeah, thanks again for being on the show and folks check the show notes for a link to all of your research and the other stuff that we've discussed in here. Eddie Lee 1:02:06:Awesome.

I am not saying that, that is conflict. But you could imagine some kind of rule that a regulator would perform in society. I don’t know what that rule is, but definitely one of the ways it manifests is by preventing the largest outbreaks from happening. Or, an attempt to.And, you know, one of the ideas behind some of the models that have been proposed for conflict is actually similar to this forest fire thing. Which is that, the conditions for conflict will simmer, and when it reaches that boiling, you can have one. And when you have one, it’s this big thing but it depletes the system in a way.And so, you are always poised between never being able to have these big conflicts and having these sorts of having like these smaller conflicts. Would it be good to prevent all conflicts or would it be bad? Would that sort of lead to some sort of special situation where you suddenly had the nuclear Armageddon? I don’t know. [Intro music] 01:00 : Michael Garfield 01:24:Since the 1940s scientists have puzzled over a curious finding. Armed conflict data reveals that human battles obey a power law distribution like avalanches and epidemics. Just like the fractal surfaces of mountains and cauliflowers, the shape of violence looks the same at any level of magnification.Beyond the particulars of why we fight, this pattern suggests a deep hidden order in the physical laws governing society. And digging in the new analysis of data from both armed conflicts and voting patterns, complex systems researchers have started to identify the so-called pivotal components involved. The straw that breaks the camel’s back. The spark that sets the forest fire. The influential but not always famous figures that shape history.Michael Garfield 02:11Can science find a universal theory that predicts the size of conflict from their initial conditions? Or identity key players whose knob society in one direction or another? Welcome to Complexity. The official podcast of the Santé Fe Institute.I am your host Michael Garfield. And each week we’ll bring you with us on far ranging on rigorous researchers developing new frameworks explaining the deepest mysteries of the universe. Michael Garfield 02:39:This week’s guest is SFI program postdoctoral Eddie Lee. Whose work in conflict avalanches and swing voters gives a glimpse of the mysterious forces that determine why we fight. And how we will be able to prevent the next conflagration. In this episode we talk about armed conflict as a fractal and a form of computation. Swing voters in the justice and influencers in pop cultures. And what these studies may have to say about the deep constraints that guide the currents of society. Michael Garfield  03:11:Just a note that this will be our last episode before short summer break to give our scientists uninterrupted time to work on a torrent of new research.

Well, shall we Eddie Lee 04:25:All right, let's do it. Michael Garfield 04:26:Yeah. Eddie Lee, it is a pleasure to have you here and our first ever in person, socially distanced podcast recording here across my patio. So welcome. Eddie Lee 04:39 :Thanks for having me. This is great. Michael Garfield 04:42 :I'd love to start as we typically do by just providing a little bit of personal background and having you talk a little bit about how you got into science and how you got into specifically an interest in the kind of research that you're doing at SFI and the stuff that we'll be talking about today. Eddie Lee 05:00 :Well, I think it was last week that actually the writer of the magic school bus series passed away. And, you know, I have to say that she really did leave a fantastic legacy and I'm part of that legacy. I grew up on, on the magic school bus and actually some after school science programs as well. So, I sort of had this nascent interest in science for a long time, something I enjoyed doing. I didn't really see myself becoming a scientist. Eddie Lee 05:32:And in fact, when I went to college, I actually tried to become an economics major surprisingly enough, but it turned out that I took this sort of fantastic course called integrated sciences. And it's sort of my preview in a way to complex sciences, because what it was a class telling us, showing us that the way of thinking in computer science, biology, chemistry, physics, we're all coming together in the context of some fascinating problems in biology. Eddie Lee 06:03:So, this idea that all these things were coming together was a really surprising thing for me. And I think what really sort of hit it home was when I read this book by Phillip ball called critical mass. And so, he brought up the aspect of society, also being part of this. And, you know, at some point in my past, I'd also read Isaac Asimov's foundation series, which is, which is the physics of social behavior and prediction. And so somehow all of these things were sort of swirling around in my head. Eddie Lee 06:35:I didn't know what to do about them. And I ended up imagining what I really need to do is go into sociology. So, I went to, I searched around, I'd try to talk with sociology professors. And I just talked with one, I think he was maybe at the head of the Taryn at the time. And he said, you know, I know this guy who might be able to direct you. And he couldn't remember the name, but he started searching online and he showed me the web page. And it was one of the professors who had taught that first class, that first course that I mentioned integrated sciences. Eddie Lee 07:05:So, he sorts of just sent me right back. Yeah. Boomerang style back into that professor's office. And he actually was familiar with SFI. So, he's the one who directed me to talk with Jessica and Dave Cracker, who now I've known for a long time. And that's sort of where all of this stuff started happening. And that's when I started really learning about what sort of science SFI works on and my sort of vague interest in it became, you know, crystallized. Michael Garfield 07:37:Awesome. Well, this is a great place actually, to just dig right in to the first set of papers I wanted to talk with you about today, which you co-authored with David and Jessica, as well as Brian Daniels and Chris Myers on scaling theory for armed conflict avalanches. So this idea that we can use physics insights to understand human social behavior from like an orbital perspective and like really much like in the foundation books, you know, that we can, we can come at the, the sort of vagaries of history from, you know, David would call a rigorous and principled quantitative approach. Michael Garfield 08:23:The history is not just the story of great men making decisions, but that those decisions occur within a landscape of physical constraints. And what are those constraints and how do they manifest themselves? And this is really interesting work and it's got a long history that you're building on. And so maybe the history of this strain of research is the right place to start. And then we can unpack it from there. Eddie Lee 08:48:Sure. Yeah. Like you're saying, it's interesting, but what we weren't focusing on was the particular stories of particular conflicts. And there's a lot to study about any particular conflict they're quite different, right? So, you might think of say the Libyan or Tunisian revolutions happening today, which are quite different from world war two, which were quite different from the British and French battling it out, say in 1812. So, these are all very distinct lines of history in and of their own. Eddie Lee 09:20:And so, what we were interested in was trying to understand whether or not there were universalities common features shared amongst these things that are clearly disparate. And as you were saying, this isn't a completely new idea. It was in 1948 that Louis Fry Richardson showed this amazing feature, which was that when you make a histogram of interstate Wars, so you count how many wars there are with F people that died, F fatalities. And you look at this histogram on a log plot, what you find is a straight line. Eddie Lee 09:54:And what's remarkable about a straight line being on a log plot is that it's, that's a power law. That means its scale free. In other words, sort of most, very naively speaking. If you were to look at a small conflict, it's sort of like a shrunk down version, statistically, speaking of a large conflict and so on and so forth all the way down. And so, this was very strange because interstate wars that you looked at were all quite different from one another. So why would you get this sort of regularity that emerges when you look across many different conflicts? Eddie Lee 10:27:And since then other people have noticed other interesting patterns in the timing of conflicts, as well, as well as terrorism and so on. And what we were interested in was looking for some of these patterns in a more recent dataset, which is called the armed conflict location event, data project, or ACLED for short. And what was remarkable about this data set was that they didn't take all these events, these small disparate individual conflict events that would occur in a war. They didn't group them together into wars. Eddie Lee 11:00:They just sort of disaggregated them into, into small localized defense. And so instead of having to take a quantity, that's already defined for you as a battle or a war or skirmish, or just a local riot, we got to connect these into ourselves, into these clusters of what we called conflict avalanches. So many ways similar to two battles or Wars, but without having assumed some of these connections from using sociopolitical factors. So just looking at the time and spatial patterns of these events, and what we found was that when you look at these conflict avalanches, various measures of their size, so not just how many people died, but how many of these reports did you obtain? Eddie Lee 11:43:How long did it last, how far did it spread? All of these different factors show these characteristic power law tales, like what Richardson saw and what we were able to do beyond that is to show that these pieces were all connected to one another in some mathematical way. And I think I had an analogy for this, which was that if you imagine you walk into a dark room and you're trying to figure out what is this object in front of you? Eddie Lee 12:12:And you find first, there's this sort of rigid pillar. Then you find this long sort of thing with a hairy end. You find this floppy disc, like thing, you start in your mind developing this picture of an elephant. And the way that that works is all these pieces are connected to one another, right? They're pieces of one whole. They're not independent, separate things. And so, you build a model in your head and you say, this must be connected. The legs must be connected to the body, must be connected to the head and so on. Eddie Lee 12:43:So, we did something like that with the mathematics of these various features. And we found that they were self-consistent in a way that seems to point to one sort of object driving the dynamics.  Eddie Lee 12:55:And that's sort of really cool because it suggests that there is some sort of underlying thing that we're just getting hints of. We haven't found it yet. We haven't discovered exactly what it is. Obviously, it's something about war and conflict, but it's perhaps something bigger, right? That leads to universal patterns, across many different types of conflict. Michael Garfield 13:17:So, you draw some analogies in one of the preprints that you've done on this work, emergent regularities and scaling and armed conflict data. You draw analogies to forest fire models, which other researchers have tried to apply to this, to neural avalanches. And, you know, just from last week's episode with the SFI counter speech team and the network graphs that you see of the Twitter data that they've harvested, and the way that you see these conversations, these sort of battles between hate speech, organized, hate speech groups and organized counter speech groups on Twitter. Michael Garfield 13:56:And this look also like these, you know, you see these the sort of conflagration of point by point debate breaking out when there's a successful, an actual collision, rather than just the hate group eliciting engagement to its original post. But people are actually willing to go into the trenches with one another on social media. And so, I would love to hear you talk a little bit more specifically about this model as a, like a branching network diagram. Michael Garfield 14:26:Yeah. There's some really interesting figures, and we'll link to this stuff in the show notes so that people can, can actually get a look at what we're talking about here. Because it actually looks rather menacing. Eddie Lee 14:39:That's why we chose those colors. Michael Garfield 14:41:The map of a branching armed conflict here. Eddie Lee 14:44:Yeah. So, cascades are a real central conceptual foundation for understanding a lot of these different kinds of phenomena. And as you mentioned, if you look at neural activity in the cortex, what you find are, are these cascades of activity, and it's not just a bunch of neurons firing, you can actually trace it out to some sort of branching process. So, you imagine there's the center, the first neuron that activates other neurons, which activate other neurons and so on sort of in a conflagration type picture. Eddie Lee 15:24:And you can also think about various other phenomena with this sort of conceptual framework. So, forest fires are another way, right? So, you imagine you have a bunch of sorts of local clusters of maybe dried out patches of trees and you have a spark, maybe some lightning strikes, and then it sort of burns its way through all these connected clusters. And you can think about that analogy applying to, to social contagion as well. And so that's why we sort of started with this idea of thinking about conflict in the same way. Eddie Lee 15:55:And mathematically, it's a very generic way of thinking about it, right? All of that you need are different pieces that are connected to one another in this sort of branching way. And so, you can get this exponential increase. Actually, this is very relevant in the context of today with COVID right? So, when people talk about exponentially growing processes, this is exactly what they mean. Or you have someone who spreads it to some other people. And if each person on average spreads up to more than one person, then you have an explosion. So, we sort of were playing with this framework and thinking about conflict in this way as a social contagion. Eddie Lee 16:29:And we're not sure if that's exactly how it spreads, but we can at least say that the way that it spreads is consistent with this idea of the way that it spreads both across space, as well as across time and in size. Michael Garfield 16:46:So, this elicits for me, links back to this sort of giant network model and building of this, these conversations on the show with all of the other conversations that hopefully we'll publish in the SFI press one day and make a poster. This reminds me a lot of, of two things. One is the conversations I just had with Jeffrey West a few episodes ago, where he was talking about biophysical scaling laws as being extremely coarse and like not actually capturing all of the variation that we would see in like specific evolutionary instances. The Primo example, being that human beings, modern humans use something like 30 times more energetic resources than we would expect from mammals of this size. Michael Garfield 17:33:Because as we've talked about with David and some of the transmission episodes, the human being is basically just the visible corner of this hyper object now. And then each of us is actually like a cyborg spanning the globe with all of these electronic augmentations. Right? So, something like that is going on in this work with conflict. And when you actually peer into the data with a little bit more granularity, you see a lot of variation in this, not enough to challenge the thesis, but enough to suggest that there are some interesting details about the regional and temporal variations of these conflicts. Michael Garfield 18:14:And I would love to hear you talk about that. And then also just to like make this kind of unwieldy let's pin onto that since you brought up COVID, Chris Morris piece for the transmission series, where you talking about super spreader and that's and how the, you know, our zero as a measure of the transmissibility of a disease, doesn't actually tell you what's going on in that particular church or in that particular campus building or, you know, so there's. So, what are the features about the data set that you've noticed that seemed to be providing insights into why there's variations in the size of these conflicts around that mean. Eddie Lee 18:56:No, that's, that's great. I mean, I think it's really important to point out that a lot of this work 's goal isn't to explain all this variation, which, you know, eventually we want to do, but it's really to talk about the shared common features across all of these phenomena. And then of course it's important to mention that, that's the only thing it explains. And so, the features that I'm talking about in terms of scaling are the averages, but you can have scaling in the variation as well. Eddie Lee 19:29:And that's, that's really interesting. And as you mentioned, right, you know, Chris Moore wrote that very nice piece where it's really important to mention that are not, is an average and not necessarily going to tell you what's happening in a very particular location. And that's also exactly true for theories about metabolic scaling in force or conflict. And in fact, it turns out that that sort of variation manifests directly in our work looking at conflict. Eddie Lee 20:02:And one of the things that we find is that it's not only essential to account for the similarities between how conflict grows in different locations, but there's also variation in terms of this sort of coefficient in front of it. So, the way that it grows the shape of the curve may be similar, but the offset of that curve may be different. And that might depend on factors such as prosperity or governance. So, here's one example, right? So, you look at Eastern Somalia, weak governance, a lot of widespread poverty and a huge amount of conflict. Eddie Lee 20:36:One of the hot zones in this and the status set. But if you look at South Africa, it's quite prosperous, they have a pretty strong government and its relatively low levels of conflict. So even if it's the case, that conflict evolves in a similar way, you just don't expect to see as much conflict and South Africa, as you see in Eastern Somalia. And so, as you also said, these things will vary in time. So hopefully Eastern Somalia is not a hotspot forever, but maybe somewhere else will become one. So, there may be patterns also in the diversity of hot zones. Eddie Lee 21:09:And we see a hint of this. We can't say that will be the case forever because we only look at 20 years. But one of the sort of fascinating things is that Richardson, who I mentioned earlier, looked at wars between, I think, early 1800s and mid-1900s. And he found basically the same statistics. Aaron?? looked at the statistics all the way from Richardson's asset up to today and found the same statistics. So, there's some sort of weird preservation of conflict despite changing technology, different countries. And, and so on that either, I don't know, is, should you be amazed or should you be afraid?  Michael Garfield 21:47:Well, I mean, again, two things come up here, right? One is Jen Dunn's work on food webs and how the structure of these food webs that their patterns of connectivity have been amazingly well-preserved conserved in there, in their form for like the last 500 million years as we've gone through all of these regimes in what is actually living in the oceans. So that's part of it, you know, and that's, that's sort of begs the question that I asked Brian Arthur, which is, do you think that we can use these models as a way of predicting like basins for future innovation, you know, and like predicting areas where we can expect potentially larger conflicts than we're seeing. Michael Garfield 22:30:And then the other piece of it is, bringing in the geopolitical component, Peter Turchin's work. When we're talking about a quantitative study of history and his writing on what he called the double helix of inequality and social instability, where he saw that they were very strongly negatively correlated over the last a hundred or 150 years. But, you know, you make a point in this paper that there are other geopolitical and geographic features that have to do with the coastlines and national borders and locations of these conflicts relative to large urban centers' populations. Michael Garfield 23:11:Yeah. So, I, again, I know that this is sort of beyond the scope of the paper, but I'm really curious, you know, what other, what other factors you think are playing into this and how that might be guiding your follow-up research in this area? Eddie Lee 23:23:I think what you can say is despite the fact that there are a lot of these universal patterns that we think we find is that there's a lot of work trying to understand the mechanisms behind why these patterns might appear. And I think there is yet a connection to be made there. And that would be sort of, I think the Holy grail for, for this sort of work is really understanding those connections and flushing them out. Eddie Lee 23:53:And somehow, they lie in the intersection of maybe social mobility, social prosperity, economic prosperity, technology, geography, right. You can't really fight someone if there's no one there, Michael Garfield 24:08:Tell that to our Facebook group. Eddie Lee 24:13:Yeah. I guess you could make up stories and so on, but there are a lot of different factors that somehow mashed together to generate these patterns. But as you were mentioning, Jen Dunn's work. That's not necessarily to say that you can't get universal patterns from that. So, you know, this is maybe too simple of an example, but one sort of that comes to mind right now, which is the central limit theorem, right? There are many reasons for why you get random likes statistics, right? Eddie Lee 24:46:Many different ways of generating them, but by virtue of their randomness, you end up getting some sort of regularity. So, we'll see. Maybe it's the fact that there are so many factors that do influence conflict that ended up getting simplification at higher scales, or maybe not, maybe, maybe it is contingent. And we, we just don't have enough granularity in our understanding to access that contingency Michael Garfield 25:15:Later on, in this paper, you talked about there being, you know, getting into this granularity, you say: "Unlike canonical cascade models, conflict also includes lattice style dynamics that evolve with geographic spread. The suppression of these dynamics away from the core could reflect social processes or geography that impact conflict evolution. Furthermore, our model suggests conflict is not only the result of local correlations and activity, but also regional and temporal disorder, perhaps reflecting memory of the severity of initiating events". Michael Garfield 25:47:So, this links directly to another paper that you wrote with Brian, David and Jessica on primate conflicts and temporal scaling collapse. And the idea, you know, Jessica's work on primate conflicts as a form of collective computation and the severity of those conflicts having to do with various factors that are performing computations at the level of like an entire primate troupe, right? So, this notion that the patterns that you're seeing in conflict data, that they hinge on there being certain evolutionary reasons for the distribution of conflict, duration, and severity is really interesting. I'm curious to hear you talk a little bit about this other paper and how it links in. Eddie Lee 26:36:Right. No, that's, that's interesting. Right? What are the functional properties of conflict, right? Is there a reason why conflict plays out the way that it does? It's hard to say for human conflicts. Obviously, there are reasons why people give for starting wars. But in monkey conflict, there's potentially one reason which is, has to do with a social hierarchy, right? So, you need to have a little bit of disorder and conflict in order to establish people's roles and where they sit. Eddie Lee 27:07:And the severity of the conflict at the same time cannot be too, too big, right. If it's too severe, it's actually detrimental to society. So, there's this idea that maybe what conflicts does is it serves an information gathering acquisition role, as long as it's not too bad, Michael Garfield 27:26:People have to survive, remember. Eddie Lee 27:28:Exactly. If you don't, if you know, if it's nuclear Armageddon again and that's it, we should remember that. But, I think one of the things that we were trying to study in that work was characterizing the features of monkey conflict and perhaps extracting from those features a potential functional role that, that these things, or these observations could, could conserve. Eddie Lee 27:53:And actually, what's really interesting about the monkey conflict is we studied a group, a society of ??. What we found was that the duration that conflicts lasted well, beta distribution, it was not a parallel distribution like human conflict, but how long they lasted that distribution of duration seemed to be a distribution that looked the same, whether you looked at small conflicts or large complex. And it's very strange because conflicts with 2 monkeys are not the same thing as conflicts with 10 monkeys. Eddie Lee 28:24:There are many more ways they can interact. There are many other things that could happen, go wrong. And so, this was very curious. And so what we found was that if you could think of these conflicts as being sort of the time for all the pairs to resolve their differences, and each of those pairs, or took some amount of time to resolve their differences, then you could get something similar to what we found in the data with the condition that the pairs that resolve their differences later remembered the sort of intensity with which the pairs resolved their differences earlier. Eddie Lee 29:03:So, in other words, if the fight started off with some intense pairwise interactions, like, you know, you bit me, how could you bite me? And that's, that's actually very apparently a very aggressive interaction that the other monkeys will not tolerate. Michael Garfield 29:18:I remember preschool. Yeah. Eddie Lee 29:19:And so, you end up having these long correlations from the beginning to the end, and if that's true, then you end up getting these, these sort of long tails of conflict duration. So, you have many conflicts that tend to last longer. And for us, when we, that was an indication of what we call collective memory, right. This idea that the entire duration of the conflict from beginning to end, some remember at the beginning. And that's what we mean by we say in that paper. Michael Garfield 30:00:Well, okay. So, you know, this, I have the luxury here of kind of like going out on the plank and speculating. Yeah. But this seems to be possibly why certain human conflicts are just insane, like the Hatfield’s and McCoy’s, you know, that the feud has a sort of durability built into it because of the way that the history of a family is prioritized. And like the, you know, the bigger the conflict gets, it would seem like certainly there are factors that are keeping resolution that are like forestalling resolution, but on the other hand, the more abstract the conflict becomes for people, the easier it is to get over. Michael Garfield 30:45:Right. So, you know, this, this is sort of like, you know, I wonder what this approach to understanding this might have to say to, or link with other work on the way that conflict between human beings has changed as war has become industrialized and has been more and more about foreign conflicts rather than defending your own, your Athens or whatever. From there are certain things that would seem to be kind of holding us in the United States in a position of kind of unending foreign Wars. Eddie Lee 31:20:Right. Well, I think it's a little bit unfair to say that these Wars are external. Right. For many people, these Wars are personal, right? Yeah. And that's their life, but sort of touching on this, on this question of, you know, how is it that conflict persists or why is it that conflict persists? I think one thing we suspect from looking at these patterns is that these memories, these core correlations in a conflict, are expressed not only in the history that people maintain about themselves, but also in the geography of how it spreads. Eddie Lee31:57:So, it's quite possible that what encodes the history of the conflict is not just what we think right, the stories that we tell ourselves, but potentially also factors of the environment. Structures that we build. And some of these structures are really obvious, right. I mean, we built the nuclear arsenal, right. It's going to be there. Right. This is really interesting to me, it sort of connects to some of the work that David, Jess and I have been doing recently with adaptation and outsourcing a memory into the environment. Eddie Lee 32:30:Right. Which is this idea that there are biological organisms that intentionally or use and manipulate the environment to couple their bad memory or the behavior with longer timescales that they need in order to better adapt. So, ants do this by building these trails. It's unlikely that individual ants can really remember what they're doing, but over the collective activity of many, they can establish these very long-lived persistent trails. And they can use this trail to harness resources. Michael Garfield: like Google calendar. Eddie Lee 33:01:Exactly. No, I mean, let me do exactly the same thing, right. I mean, David has that example of the notepad, right? Multiply three times, six times, five times, 2,374. I can't do it in my head, but give me a piece of paper. I can just, basically you short term memory expressed on paper to do that calculation very efficiently. And in addition to opening up new ways of doing that calculation, that aren't accessible in my head to myself. So, there is this question, right? Sort of going back to the functional properties of armed conflict, you know, what purpose does armed conflict solve? Eddie Lee 33:32:Are there ways that we are sort of driving our conflict ourselves by embedding into our environment that we don't know of, that we do know of. And I don't think those questions are necessarily answered. At least I haven't seen those answers, but would be really interesting to think about, I mean, right, this is just one other phenomenon in nature, right? It's not just us that fight. We do fight with certain technologies and armed human conflicts or especially cause a lot of fatalities compared to other organisms. So, we're quite brutal, but. Michael Garfield 34:02:You know, to, to bring up a marvelous work of science fiction, that seems to have some direct bearing on the insights that you just said. I've been in a book club recently discussing the science fiction trilogy Lilith's Brood by Octavia Butler. Should I read this? It's an extraordinary hit. It's a very, very relevant and kind of evergreen piece of work by the first science fiction author to ever become a MacArthur fellow. It just highly awarded a black female science fiction author, you know, just an amazing, amazing mind. Michael Garfield 34:36:And I've been on the tip of trying to read more black Sci-fi right now to get a better understanding of the world spaces disclosed thereby. And in this book, this book is about humans interacting kind of non-consensually with a race of aliens that comes to earth and finds us in the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse. And once they're masters of bioengineering and they want to reboot our planet and nurse humankind and the biosphere back from extinction. Michael Garfield 35:09:But in order to do that, they kind of have to change the rules for human beings. And one of the things that they do is they refuse to give the humans that are going to repopulate earth, any writing materials, like it's part of their thing, that they all have genetically engineered eidetic memory. And so, they would rather engineer us to have perfect recall, then allow us to record history on paper. Eddie Lee 35:37:It sounds like a curse. You know, you know, that, I guess that was the thing for a long period of human history, right? Oral tradition, Homer, obviously, until it was written down. Yeah. What is it that keeps us fighting? Is it, is it literature? And that would be even, there'd be very tragic and somewhat ironic actually, because we're supposed to learn from history. Michael Garfield 36:05:But you know, in this paper, I think it's, like you said, it's the end of the conflict remembers the beginning. Yeah. There's another piece here, which is about the beginning. And I think that this might give us a hinge to get into some discussion about your other work on swing voting, which is really, you know, also very timely and interesting. You and your co authors on this piece, talk about policers or the police macaques. And they're being like thresholds at which they will or will not intervene in order to break up a conflict before it becomes a conflagration. Michael Garfield 36:44:And I'm curious to hear you talk a little bit about how thinking about conflict as a collective computation illuminates, why we may make a choice to mediate a conflict or to de escalate it or to allow it to run its course. Right? Yeah. So, what are your thoughts on all of that? Eddie Lee 37:04:Yeah. Well, first the disclaimer is that I'm not an expert on mechanics society. So, so that, you know, when I talk with Jess later, I can say that I said this, but yeah. So, these police or macaque or high-power individuals that, I mean, you know, in short other macaque don't want to mess with them. So, if they get in a fight, you just don't hit the policer or per usual. So, they're serving some sort of regulatory mechanism and maybe in the sort of conceptual abstract sense, regulatory control is very important in terms of outbreaks and contagion, right? Eddie Lee 37:40:So, for example, for example, and I'm not saying that this is macaque conflict, but you know, if you have a fire or a forest with a lot of dry wood that hasn't been cleared away by previous small conflagrations, you can have a major conflagration, right? So, you have this idea that by preventing all, but the largest of conflagrations you've sort of saved the system, allowing it to renew itself. I'm not saying that that is a macaque conflict, but you could imagine some kind of role, right. That, that a regulator would perform in this sort of society. Eddie Lee 38:13:I don't know what that role is, but definitely one of the ways that it manifests is by preventing these, the largest, you know, outbreaks from happening or an attempt to. And, you know, that is sort of interesting. I don't know what the computational rule of conflict in human society is, but you know, one of the ideas behind some of the models that have been proposed for conflict is actually similar to this forest fire thing, which is that the conditions for conflict will simmer, right? Eddie Lee 38:47:And then when it reaches that boiling point, you can have one and when you have one, it's this big thing. But it depletes the system in a way. And so, you are always poised between never being able to have these big conflicts. I mean, truly massive ones, you know, think world war five and, and having these sort of like smaller conflicts, but I don't know, I don't know what would be, right. Would it be good to prevent all conflicts or would it be bad? Eddie Lee 39:18:Would that sort of lead to some sort of special situation where you suddenly had, you know, the nuclear Armageddon and I don't know, but it is, it is sort of an interesting question to think about, Michael Garfield 39:29:You know, pull in a totally non-scientific perspective on this from a rather sketchy character. I remember Osho Rajneesh, the disgraced guru that brought his cult into Oregon, had a line in one of his books. He said, you know, be aware of the pacifist because they're sitting on a volcano and. And you know, race had, ?? D'Souza just gave one of the flash workshop talks last week on timescales and tradeoffs, where she was talking about this in terms of exactly what you just said about, you know, if you have small forest fires every once in a while, it prevents this big one. Michael Garfield 40:09:So, you know, the question is in our efforts to expunge conflict from the planet. Are we really doing ourselves a long range disservice, are we making a tradeoff That's actually making the system dramatically more brittle than it otherwise would be? And then this starts getting into sort of more archeological or historical perspectives on the role of organized sports as a way of, of, you know, channeling our aggression into something that's less likely to result in. I mean, you might flip a cop car if you win the championship. Eddie Lee 40:42:Well, you know, I don't even know if it has anything to do with human nature, right. It might just be the way that modern society is structured. So, who knows? I mean, I think there's a real question here about what are the conditions required for armed conflict? Why does that happen? And, you know, could you get, could you develop a system where it just doesn't and totally avoid this whole issue? And I think it's actually quite complicated because conflict is associated with so many things. You know what I mean? It's not just like conflict by itself. Eddie Lee 41:13:Conflict comes with famine, comes with disease, comes with poverty, comes with deaths. I mean, you're, you're basically tearing a lot of things apart. So, it's just one side of the coin. And so maybe, you know, it's not pleasers you need, right. Maybe it's something else. Maybe you just need to change how people see one another. Michael Garfield 41:34:Yeah. At risk of being misunderstood as making a political statement here. I've been thinking a lot after talking with Jeff West about his work on, you know, the branching of the circulatory system as being a way of minimizing friction, minimizing turbulence in the bloodstream. And so, if we're going to apply that kind of biophysical scaling law insight to the way that we have established our systems of governance, then the question is, well, what does a truly fractal policing system look like? Michael Garfield 42:06:Because I used to work in festivals and, you know, there is this question of, if someone is trying to get into a fight at a festival, is it really appropriate to call the police? Can this be handled like burning man does with volunteer Rangers that are trained in de-escalation before it becomes a legal issue? And so, you know, this is, I think that your work is really inspiring for anyone who's interested in the conversation around police reform and for, you know, the kind of dynamic governance that I talked about with David in our transmission series about how many layers of modular decision making are necessary in order to get something that is both robust and isn't going to just implode periodically. Eddie Lee 42:54:Right, right. Yeah. I think, I think there were some big questions here, right. That goes far beyond the political issues at play today. Right. I mean, the questions that we're asking about complex systems are big questions about the system and might even question the sort of principles of the system. If you can get sort of a similar outcome with a completely or sorry, a different outcome with a completely different setup, that'd be really interesting. You know, I mean, especially in the context of armed conflict, because it really does seem for at least a couple of hundred years of innate features of the system. Eddie Lee 43:31:I mean what is it about the system that you can change? Can you change it? Is it human nature? Is it our construction and modern society? I think those are questions that haven't been answered and somehow, they're connected to, by the fact that conflict is associated with many of these other things, they're really connected with serious social problems that still have played to human society for a while. So, I think there is a chance here really by digging into one of these aspects, potentially being able to get an understanding of some of these broader social issues. Michael Garfield 44:07:So, this is the place for us to pivot, forgive the pun here into a discussion of the paper that you lead authored for Royal society interface on this is sensitivity of collective outcomes, identifies pivotal components. You know, we're coming up on the presidential election, the conversation around swing voters. And everybody wants to figure out who are the people to target that ended up sending the sand pile down one side of the Hill versus the other, right. Michael Garfield 44:40:So, could you unpack this particular paper and a little bit of the, you know, the sort of fundamental framing that you're doing here and, you know, get into the details on that place. Yeah. Eddie Lee 44:52:So, what we did here was we started with this idea of the median voter. So, the median voters, basically the person who sits in the middle, right, that's a swing better. So, imagine you had a bunch of people, let's imagine the simplest situation where you could just label them left and right. But then there's an odd number of people you decide by majority. And there's the person sending the middle, that's the median voter. Now that's a very simplified situation. And I think many situations are often simplified into this binary choice, which is not the case because there were so many things that actually come into play in a vote and across many votes, actually, right? Eddie Lee 45:31:Right? So, you never just have a median voter. The voter might be immediate on one issue, but not on any others and you might have variation, right? So, imagine that this bill is an obvious left, right? But you want it to pass, you know, what their median is going to do, then you change it. You make a more complex bill with many amendments and so on, right? So, you can play with this in many ways. And so, as a result, you're not really asking, or we weren't really asking what is the median voter, but once we account for all these sorts of potential complexities that manifest in the statistics, how could we identify that person who sort of plays that role more consistently than others? Eddie Lee 46:11:So, a little bit more of a subtle definition of median. And we call these pivotal voters who pivotal components. And this is a very general way of asking the problem, right? So, it's to say that if I were to push and tug on each of these people in different ways, how would the outcome change in the voting system? The outcome is the majority votes or different ways that people couldn't divide up into groups. But again, you can think about this and in different contexts, right? So, Twitter is an example. So, you imagine everyone sort of voting in a different way by choosing to use certain words. Eddie Lee 46:43:So, the vote is not just left or right, but it's whether I used it, I talked about this K-pop idol or this K-pop idol right. So, you make a choice about which community you start to belong to in terms of the words you use. And then we asked, like, if some people were to change their words, would that really substantially change the collective groupings of, of other people? And you can ask a similar question about stocks in that case. It's a little bit less about what you can change, but more of a sort of identification principle, right? Eddie Lee 47:14:Because it's very hard to change. For example, the, what was it, the SNP spider indices, you don't, you don't just go in and change the data. Those are an aggregation of many different things happening. So, it's more, just a sort of a way of understanding how they move with respect to one another. So, we took this sort of generalized idea of a median and try to understand, for example, and in congressional voting or Supreme court voting, could we identify these people that you would want to tug or push? Eddie Lee 47:46:And we actually asked quite a bit, sort of a general question. We didn't ask if there's one person, what if you could control anybody? Right. So, I could pay everybody a bribe, but to go in different directions. And the goal would be to change the outcome as much as possible. And what we found was that in some cases we found certain individuals that seem to matter a lot. And some cases we found that it actually wasn't one individual actually you'd have to sort of control the entire system to change things. Eddie Lee 48:17:And that's sort of interesting because you know, it sorts of hints at this idea of manipulation, right? So, a system where you have to push a lot of different things at once, you have to push all the buttons in different ways, all at the same time, that's hard, that's complex. Whereas if you just paid one guy and you get all the votes your way. Well, great. I know exactly what to do. So, we sort of look for that signal. And I, I guess maybe I'll point out one of the examples that we looked at, which was the Supreme court, and this is not the modern court, this is the Rehnquist, the second run core score, which was from 94 to 2005 when William Rehnquist was a chief justice. Eddie Lee 48:55:And what we found was that the primary signal was not about O'Connor and Kennedy, who are presumably the median voters that matter the most and that's, that's conventional wisdom. And that was really interesting. Right? So, suggest that there's something more complicated going on. I think given some of the work I've done, that's not so surprising, but as it turns out that it's a little bit more subtle, right? It's not that power is totally diffused throughout the court. Eddie Lee 49:26:If you ask whether courts, whether a vote was liberal conservative, and there's some ambiguity here in how you determine whether something is liberal conservative, but sort of pushing those aside for the moment. If you just ask whether the decision was conservative or liberal, and you asked who was the sort of most influential, according to this measure, then you do find O'Connor and Kennedy. So somehow the fact that you can identify them as being important voters hinges on your interpretation of their votes as partisan. Eddie Lee 49:58:If you don't, if you don't, if you forget about the partisan, you just say they voted in these ways, then they don't, they don't seem to be important. So somehow, right, the statistics are telling us something potentially very interesting, which is that influence is not only a measure of the changes that someone can impose, but your interpretation of those changes as well. Michael Garfield 50:23:Gosh, you know, I'm just thinking about this in light of research that was done right before the 2016 us presidential election on search result ranking. I forget who it was that published this, but they were talking about the difference in a news item, making it to the top search result versus the second search result and how they were able to swing by modulating that across the entire population of people actually issuing these searches. Michael Garfield 50:53:They were able to swing electoral results by up to 25% in one direction or the other. And they actually tested this on some mayoral elections in India, where they were able to demonstrate that they were, they were able to throw, and they didn't actually do it. Oh, I was okay with it, it was a retrodiction of results that had happened, like a matter of weeks before. Yeah. But they were, I mean, they basically said, look, you know, the search companies need to be aware that the structure of accountability within these organizations, when you have an opaque algorithm for search results and the company, they can throw somebody under the bus who was working under nondisclosure on the algorithm and say, Oh, this was a rogue agent. Michael Garfield 51:40:We lack effective safeguards in society to prevent this kind of thing from happening because the kind of manipulation at scale that you're talking about does seem possible. Eddie Lee 51:51:Right. So, what you're saying is that it's not just the facts that you give people, but the salience of those facts. Yeah. And that's, that's actually very subtle because, you know, I certainly actually, I, you know, it was just last, was it this past week I heard a talk about this, but I just can't for the gut of me remember, but something about salient being really important for determining how people interpret events around them. Michael Garfield 52:18:So, there's another dimension of this paper, in your discussion on this paper, you're talking about this, not only in terms of voting results, but in the susceptibility of population to disease or disinformation. And so, you know, David and Jeffrey and many other people at SFI have written about, and we, you know, we had Laura Hibbard, the friend and the scarp, you know, on the show also recently talking about cultural contagions. Yeah. And so, I'm trying to wrap my head around how this model could inform a strategy for fighting disinformation in this way. And like, what would that look like? Eddie Lee 53:02:Well, you know, it's, it's kind of hard to make that connection. I think formally because we're looking at the statistics. So, we look over many aggregate dynamics and so on. And I think probably for something like this information who really do want to understand the dynamics of how things are spreading. So, there is that sort of shortcoming, but you could still ask, I think in that context, you know, how changes in the system could result or what changes in the system could result in the largest changes in the outcomes. Eddie Lee 53:35:And I think sort of to do that, you sort of have to rely on the fact we're focusing on this mathematical technique for, for studying the response of a system to perturbation. So, we're asking, we're sort of thinking about that in a statistical sense. It doesn't have to be in a statistical sense, but actually it sort of connects to a really interesting set of ideas of sort of tangential to this. And what it should say is this, this field right, is relying on this idea of information geometry. Eddie Lee 54:07:And what information geometry is about is imagining that if you have some sort of mathematical description of a system, it has to be parameterized. You typically choose parameters in a way that makes sense relative to what you're studying, but you could imagine changing those parameters. And you could imagine an alternate universe where a different sort of dynamics range. And so, this idea is that these models are all connected to one another. If you change the parameters a little bit at a time, eventually you get to those crazy alternative universes, which is totally different. Eddie Lee 54:42:But the path that you take is described by information geometry. And what we say is the curvature of, of that geometry. So how quickly it changes tells us how sensitive the system is, right? So, if I change this parameter a tiny amount and all of a sudden, I am in this alternative universe, then it's highly sensitive. It's highly sensitive to perturbation, right? Whereas if it's totally insensitive, two changes, then this primary almost doesn't matter, right? Eddie Lee 55:14:You basically get the same universe. It's slightly different. Maybe the colors of the cars are not quite the same, but it's almost exactly the same and what it turned out to be the case in a lot of physical models of the world is that, and you have many parameters that actually don't matter. And you have a few parameters that really do. So, for example, in the biology of a cell, you have these sophisticated bottles with tons of parameters that you can never hope to measure. Eddie Lee 55:44:And in fact, you can't really measure them anyway. Okay. But if you plug those values into the mathematical model, you basically get a cell that works. So, this is incredible because you're sometimes off by a hundred percent, 200%, but it's the works. Why it's because the information geometry is actually multi-dimensional and in some directions of parameter space, it's totally flat. So, all of the universes look exactly the same along that dimension. And it's very, very sharp along some other dimensions. So, you have to get some things right. And those things matter a lot, but most things don't matter. Eddie Lee 56:15:And so, this idea that you have this hierarchy of sensitivity, right, is what allows us to understand that the world, because if everything mattered, everything's out the window, you can never do that. You can never understand nature, but the fact that there's a hierarchy means that I can first build a model that sort of right, right. Newton's model or Copernicus's model, it's sort of right. It's not exactly right, but it's good enough that people believe me. And then, you know, Newton comes by and then Einstein comes by. But all of those additional effects features are smaller and smaller. Eddie Lee 56:45:And so that's what I mean by hierarchy of parameters. Right? And so that's what allows us to, well, that's a claim, but you know, that's, that's what makes the universe easy to learn about. And hopefully that is true. Generally. It's not, it's not clear that's true for every complex system, right. Which is why the complex systems are hard, difficult, but what's sort of interesting in the context of pivotal components is if there is such a hierarchy, then it means that this system is easier to control, right? Because you don't need every degree of freedom. Eddie Lee 57:16:So perhaps in order to facilitate diffusion of power, you want to design systems that are completely impossible to control unless you have all the fingers on the right triggers at the right time. Whereas if you want it to be controllable, then you need to design it with this idea in mind. And you can imagine situations where you want A, and you don't want B or you want controllability and you don't want non-controllability. And that's sort of the connection. There's a long-winded way of getting to this connection with, you know, susceptibility in say, disinformation is one might want to ask, how are these systems designed and are they designed in a way that makes them easily manipulated or makes them hard to manipulate? Eddie Lee 58:03:And do you want one or the other? Because you know, it could be that disinformation is really hard to root out when things are very decentralized, right? So, it may actually be a clash of values, right? You may actually want one thing, but it just leads to the wrong thing. Michael Garfield 58:19:I'm reminded of a, was it around the 2004 presidential election? Someone had a video where they taught a chimpanzee to manipulate one of the Diebold voting machines. You know, you can like, you can teach a Chimp to hack this, which brings us back all the way back around to the primate stuff. Yeah. You know, as somebody who has a lifelong abiding interest in both the sort of philosophy around evolutionary theory, as well as time travel fiction, you know, these, what you just described are the two sort of worldviews that you see at war in the debate over evolutionary contingency versus inevitability, you know, it's, it's ultimately, it's a dispute between two different models. Michael Garfield 58:56:Like, do you have Ashton Kutcher's butterfly effect, time travel where every, you know, like you keep changing everything on accident or is it more like back to the future where it only matters who sleeps together? You know, that's, that's, you know, somehow that, you know, the timeline is like completely robust against these perturbations. And so, you know, that's, I guess until we have this figured out, my advice is to like, not get in the DeLorean. Right. I don't know. Well, dude, it's, it's been absolutely wonderful talking with you before we wrapped this. Michael Garfield 59:31:I just an opportunity to tell people a little bit more about what's on your plate right now as a researcher and what you're looking forward to, what are the burning questions for you right now? And, on the horizon, in the months of confinement to come here, Eddie Lee 59:52:Well, I'm, I'm writing the second Principia Mathematica, you know, because people keep saying, you know, this is the time when you really get some work done. And I'm sort of past that now. It's been so many months? Michael Garfield:And it's horrible. Eddie Lee 1:00:12:If you keep telling people you're working on this grand project, nothing comes out while you're still working on it. No, I have, I have several things on my plate right now that are sort of on and off. One thing is sort of extending this armed conflict stuff to start really digging into some of the, sort of maybe contingent factors, but trying to find patterns in the contingencies that unify them. We're also been looking at Jeffrey West Chris campus. And I have been looking at metabolic scaling theory or in the forest. So, trying to understand some of the dynamics that lead to scaling and forest populations and hopefully actually touch on armed conflict in some way. Eddie Lee 1:00:52:I've also been thinking about acquisition of information in firms. So, trying to see why is it that firm lifetimes are distributed in a very sort of regular way, surprisingly across sectors. And does it have to do with how they're learning, how they're acquiring information from around them. I'm finishing a project with Jess and David on adaptation learning and adaptation. And it actually, the idea is that we're thinking about different forms of memory embedded in either the organism in its behavior or in its environment, and trying to unify these various mechanisms or implementations of memory into a sort of optimal adaptation framework. Eddie Lee 1:01:36:I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but it's a lot and, um. Michael Garfield 1:01:39:You don't have to keep fighting it. Right. If you've forgotten it, if you've heard that ??. Eddie Lee 1:01:47:There's no glue, you know, at some point it will lead to some cascading failure. Michael Garfield 1:01:52:Fair enough. Well, yeah, thanks again for being on the show and folks check the show notes for a link to all of your research and the other stuff that we've discussed in here. Eddie Lee 1:02:06:Awesome. It was fun. [Outro]Michael Garfield 1:02:08:Thank you for listening. Complexity is produced by the Santa Fe Institute.

And if we understood the laws of information, they would really be the laws of life. So being a physicist, and again, this was another one of my analogies, but I like these because they're illuminating for me about how I'm thinking about things is that, like, if you want to understand the laws of gravitation, then you go and study black hole because you have a very intense gravitational field there and you can understand, and pro gravity very well. If you want to understand a lot of information and how information operates in the physical world, then you should go and study a living thing because that's where information actually has its most, you know, it's like densest or most intense. And so I think the origin of life process is really this transition where you have systems that where information is not really a prominent part of the physics of those systems to ones where it really is. And so we really have to understand how is it that information actually starts to gain control over the dynamics of the system.Michael Garfield: One of the defining characteristics of complex system science is the shift in emphasis from objects to relationships and processes. How is information related to matter and energy and how do the distinct formulations of different scientific lineages braid together in a unifying pattern? The search for a more fundamental understanding drives directly into some of the biggest questions science has to ask about the living world. Namely, what is life? What is alive? And when did life began? The Santa Fe Institute has drawn from the deep Wells of these questions since the 1980s. In our second episode, Complexity Podcast dove in to explore the origins of life. But even that in-depth conversation left a lot unsaid. Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of SFI. I'm your host, Michael Garfield. While we continue our short summer hiatus. Here's a superb interview with SFS, newly announced, external professor, Sara Imari Walker of Arizona State University by Marty Martin and Art Woods. The hosts of the big biology podcast and this rapid-fire rap from their ninth episode.Sara talks about how physics and in particular information theory, refocuses the lens through which researchers ask about the nature of living systems and look for signs of life elsewhere in the cosmos. We hope that you enjoy and after subscribing to Complexity and Big Biology, wherever you go for podcasts, follow up with their equally illuminating conversation with SFI external professor Andy Dobson on disease ecology.

Those devoted to, in the grand phrasing, "unifying life across scales and ecology," and hearing a great set of talks. Sara's going to talk tomorrow morning, and we got her to sit down with us and to talk about her work. She is a fellow at the ASUSFI Center for Biosocial Complex Systems, and also an assistant professor at Arizona State University, and we're just super delighted that you're sitting down to talk with us! SW: I'm excited too, it's going to be a lot of fun.  AW: So, you've written a lot about the origin of life on Earth and possible origin of life elsewhere in the universe, and we just wanted to dig into the details of that, and I want to start by just reading a quote that you had in one of your papers: "The origin of life is among the greatest open problems in science. How is it that life can emerge from non-living matter?" We totally agree. Like, fabulously interesting question.  SW: I was going to say, it's a bad start if you disagree with that.  AW: And I guess, so maybe take us through what we do know, just very briefly, about the history of life on Earth. So, you know, at what point did it arise, and then what's the sort of big, open set of problems that are associated with that?  SW:  Yeah, so it's interesting because you're asking about the historical origins of life on Earth, and I think there's something interesting about asking it as a historical question, or asking it as a testable question, so we can get to that later, but so there is this historical question about origins, like what was the origin of life on Earth, and then there's another question that people ask in the origins community is, is the origin of life like a testable thing, like can we do it in the lab, and how do we actually understand that, or can we look for origins of life on other planets. So, there's actually a lot of ways of thinking about origins that aren't just the historical, what happened on early Earth. The idea in current thinking is that life arose on our planet around 4 billion years ago, but the dates are very difficult to constrain. The earliest fossil evidence of life is fairly complex, around 3.8 billion years ago people have found evidence...  AW: Those are the stromatolites?  SW: Yeah, those are the stromatolites, and so those are like microbial mats, they're very complex ecological communities, and if we try to push the understanding of the history of life further back than that, we don't have a fossil record, and it's very unclear and speculative exactly when life emerged. But a lot of people make arguments that since life was so complex at that stage, it had emerged very early, but we don't actually know the pace of evolution early on either, so it could have happened over a couple 100 million time scale, it could've been longer, and so that part of it is very speculative. So, there's a big sort of black box if you go any earlier that we don't know exactly when life emerged, we don't know in what environment, we don't know what it looked like when it first emerged, if it had the same chemistry that modern life has, and so there's a whole host of questions there.   MM: Are we, we're fairly confident though that it arose once?  SW: Presumably. So, this gets into some interesting things, because there is this well, sort of, discussed attribute on life that all of life on Earth shares the same biochemistry, and so what's meant by that statement is every organism we've ever characterized has DNA, every living thing, you know, uses ribosomes as part of its translation machinery, has proteins. So, all of the biochemical architecture that's at the core of life is universal. And so, people will talk often about this idea of a last universal common ancestor, so previously I talked about the rock record, the fossil evidence with stromatolites for life, but we also have evidence of early life from the molecular record, and that's actually a really fascinating record in its own rite, because, you know, there's some molecules like the ribosome that have been around for 3.8 billion years, but they're not a physical structure, it's a thing that keeps reconstructing itself, so there's some kind of information associated with that, right? There's this informational pattern that keeps reconstructing itself on this planet. But if you're talking about like, tracing all of that history back in time, it seems that all of the lineages that we study now have this common ancestor that we call the last universal common ancestor, and that being singular is kind of, I think misleading to a lot of people, because they think it was a single cell, and in reality it was a community of cells, and a lot of people that study this early phase of evolution recognize that there was a lot of horizontal gene transfer happening in things, so you can't even really talk about an individual with how these kind of populations were evolving. And so what I think gets really fascinating about thinking about this early stage is that a lot of our things that we think about, like with individuality or the way we think about evolution being Darwinian and not necessarily a collective kind of breakdown when you get to that last universal, yeah. So the last universal common ancestor, I think, so that's the sort, so one way to think about it like, because I'm a physicist and my brain always goes there, is like, the last universal common ancestor is sort of like what the surface of last scattering is for cosmology. It's like, the surface where like, you know, photons and matter decoupled and we actually can see the early universe, but we can't see much earlier than that, because it's just like a thermal shield. If you think about the last universal common ancestor, we had rapid genetic exchange of information, and we don't really, you know, before that there was no genetic machinery, like we don't know when genes evolved, and we can't go back earlier than genetics, because that's how we trace the history of things. So, it's sort of, it's sort of like this, this surface that we hit all the lineages go back and they kind of unify in this kind of amorphous, you know, messy chemistry of, you know, rapid gene exchange, and then we don't know what preceded that. And so there's a lot of hypotheses about life and early life, and how life originated, and so you'll probably hear all kinds of different ones that are more popular, but the one I'm really kind of fascinated with most recently is this idea that the emergence of life was actually a planetary scale process. I think this is really an intriguing way of thinking about it, because a lot of people think about life as a localized transition, so they think, you know, some little protocell formed in some pocket hydrothermal vent, and some RNA got in it and that RNA started copying itself, or you had some RNA forming on a beach somewhere and that started copying itself, but you always have this kind of, singular...  AW: Gradual takeover of the entire world?  SW: Yeah, the sort of singular event, evolution got started and it spread out. And that's a very biological narrative, right? But then you have like, and so, then you'll have other people talking about sort of like, metabolism, self-organizing, and these kinds of things. And a lot of times that kind of gets also talked about as a localized event, that you had some, you know, collection of molecules that formed what's called an autocatalytic set, where each molecule can produce the next, and it forms a closed cycle so you get a reproducing system. So again, it's trying to get at this idea of a self-reproducing system that can evolve. But if, if you think, so, but there's this whole set of other ideas circling around, how biochemistry might emerge from geochemistry, which I think is really interesting, because you're going to think about like the Earth, and the emergence of life, you know, is emerging from the Earth, and that there actually might have been geochemical cycles that started organizing into biochemical cycles. And so Harold Morowitz is really...  AW: So, what kinds of geochemical cycles?  SW: Well, so, Harold Morowitz was one of the first people that really started talking about this and has been, sort of, promoted more recently by Eric Smith, and Edward [UNKNOWN] and all these kind of people that are thinking about these things, but the idea is that central metabolism, in particular the [what is this word] citric acid cycles, like the primitive core of metabolism, actually might have been something that was thermodynamically favored geochemically. So, you have this self-organizing cycle that actually became a product, was a product of geochemistry, and then out of that emerged all of these biochemical architectures, because once you get the citric acid cycle going, like that basically makes a lot of the things that are building blocks for life.  AW: So, do you mean that the citric acid cycle got going in some prehistory in the absence of all of the enzymes that we now know are catalyzing?  SW: Yes. And so, yeah, so there's a lab in, led by Joseph Moran that's been basically showing a lot of those steps can be catalyzed without enzymes, and just by minerals. So, there are testable hypotheses there, which is really interesting. So, one of the reasons I think this is really intriguing, and it's a relevant thing actually to talk about at an ecology conference, is I think there's a lot of misconceptions when we're talking about life, about there being a fundamental unit of life, or a particular scale that life is like, preferred to exist at. So, I think ecologists appreciate this because they recognize, you know, ecological communities are very alive in a sense, you know, that the individuals aren't, or the, it doesn't make sense to talk about the individuals sometimes because they're so amorphous. And so, for thinking about origins of life, you know, you can think about the origins of life itself actually as an ecological process. There's some organizing cycles, and maybe like individuality emerged later, and one of the reasons that I find this really intriguing is because when I think about life and the kind of, sort of, informational perspective, if you want to call it that, that I think about it, it's really sort of like the hierarchy, and that these processes exist across many scales, and the only natural boundary for that kind of process is actually at the planetary scale. And so, it seems very natural to think about life at a planetary scale, and it's actually very illuminating to do that. So, one of the things I do in my science a lot is try to find places where the thinking is so different, or so skewed from the way we're used to it that you actually have, like potential for a lot of conceptual breakthroughs. They may be, they may not be right, but at least thinking about the problem differently opens up lots of new questions, which is what you want to do in science.  MM: Yeah, that's a really interesting approach to things, you know.  AW: Yeah, amazing. As you're talking about these cycles and sort of geochemistry, I was thinking about, how do you graft on all of these much more familiar biological parts, so in your conception of that, how did DNA arise? How did we get RNAs? You know, sort of transfer mechanism. How do proteins as catalysts arise, and then take over those functions that might have been formerly done by minerals, say, in a geochemical cycle? SW: Yeah, so I think a lot of these questions are hard because we're so used to thinking about the details in biology and not the underlying processes. So, as you're saying all of these things, I'm thinking, I'm like, how am I going to explain that, how am I going to explain that from the theory? But I think the real thing is that like, for example, when you're talking about DNA, there's an interesting thing with DNA, because DNA instantiates information that's relevant to the organism, and so what I think is important about DNA is that it's a molecule that allows you to copy information contained in the molecule to another molecule, and do so reliably. And so, I think, I think, I don't necessarily have answers to all of the steps that you asked, but I think a way of thinking about it is that we talk about a lot of things that are really essential to biology, like metabolism, and reproduction, and compartmentalization, and so a lot of times when people are talking about life they'll try to make these like list definitions of life, like it has to have all of these attributes. I think if there really is an underlying theory that explains life, that all of those properties are probably derivative of that theory. And so, this is what appeals to me about thinking about information as being the organizing thing for living systems, because all of things really do have sort of a natural description as being derivative processes. So, copying of information is obviously really important, but information flows also can organize metabolic cycles, and if you have a compartment, that means that you actually are excluding some information from the environment and allowing some information in, and actually can structure a system very differently. And there are lots of really interesting, sort of, ways of thinking about what the underlying structure of these systems is, if you translate everything into that kind of language, then you get a much clearer, unified picture of what's actually happening, from my perspective.  MM: That's interesting. That's a really good segue into, when we teach introductory biology, you ask the students, "what's life," and they start giving off the list that you just said, "well, okay... think about this..." Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, to transition into more, sort of, digital-analog, top-down, the types of things that you've been thinking about, you have, to quote you, again if I can get it right, "The two problems of defining life and solving its origin, they can't really disentangle." So, what's that about?  13:10 SW: Right. So, I started, so I am an origin of life scientist, and I think of my primary subject matter as being origins of life, but if you look at like, what I do and what my research group does, almost none of it would seem like it's origin of life related, because we look at biology across all scales -- organization, you know, in things like ants or cities, or, you know, whatever it is. But, for me, it's because when I was, in particular when I was a post-doc, because I was working at the Center for Chemical Evolution at Georgia Tech, building models for chemical evolution, there's always this problem with origins of life that you want to talk about this transition from non-life to life, but you have no criteria for what life is. And it would just drive me nuts, because I'm supposed to be building models for chemical evolution and saying they were becoming more lifelike, and I have no quantifiable criteria. And so, this is why I think really that theory is critically important to origins of life, and that theory really must be one where you have some way of objectively saying what it is that you mean by when you say something is alive or not, or something is life or not. And alive and life are interesting also in their own right because they're not exactly the same thing. But, so, most of what I really try to think about is what is life, and how would I actually, and sometimes build a life meter, or make some sort of quantifiable criteria for what life is. And so, for a long time, I think I was thinking that issue was more black and white than I do now, that maybe there was, because you could ask is it continuous, or is there some sort of discontinuity, where you'll go from something is not alive to something is alive. And the way I think about it now is that, when we're talking about life, life is an example of a particular kind of physical phenomenon, and what I really think underlies it is that we really don't understand how information operates in the physical world, and if we understood the laws of information they would really be the laws of life, and so being a physicist, and again this is another one of my analogies, but I like these because they're illuminating for me about how I'm thinking about things, is that, if you want to understand the laws of gravitation, then you go and study a black hole, because you have a very intense gravitational field there, and you can understand and probe gravity very well. If you want to understand the laws of information and how information operates in the physical world, then you should go and study a living thing, because that's where information actually has its most, you know, it's like densest, or like most intense. And so, I think the origin of life process is really this transition where you have systems that, where information is not really a prominent part of the physics of those systems to ones where it really is. So, we really have to understand how is it that information actually starts to gain control over the dynamics of the system and becomes an important part of it. And then most of the unfolding of the biosphere over the last 4 billion years, in my mind, is building increasingly extracted levels of informational structures that are, you know, you build up this hierarchy. So, the kind of information that we manage today is very abstract, not very tied to the physical substrate at all. So, you can compare like, the information in a computer, like you guys have text on a computer I'm looking at right now, and you just read some of that text, so like, the people listening to this podcast are going to hear that and it's going to get translated into their brain. So, you think about all the different physical media that information went through, and somehow it retains its properties of being information, and meaning the same thing in this room as it does to the people that are going to be listening to this podcast. Now, if you look at DNA and like, early information structures, it's really difficult actually to copy the information in DNA to other physical media, other chemistry, and do it so, the information there is really tied to the particular chemical, physical thing. And so, nowadays we can copy DNA to other genetic polymers, but that required 4 billion years of evolution. So, if you give me, yeah that information can be instantiated in other things, but early information was, it became abstracted from those physical things, but the level of abstraction and the number of different things that you could actually instantiate that information in, and what that information is doing as far as its control over the dynamics of the system has just been increasing over biological evolution. But somehow, that started at the origin of life.  AW: Wow, so many ways to go here. I want to ask about, you know, you just sort of gave your reason for trying to define what life is, and I would say that's a hard question for most biologists, because we don't grapple with it very much, weirdly, right? And is that because most biologists sort of take it for granted that we already know what life is, or do they feel like it's too hard of a question, and unapproachable?  SW: Well, I think, I think, it's not necessarily a relevant question to the questions that you're asking. If you're already studying biology, you want to ask questions about the biology we have on Earth, then you don't really need to know what life is universally. So, I think it just depends upon what description, level of description, you're at. I think the place you really need to know is origins of life or looking for life on other planets. But if I just want to know, like, you know, I go in my backyard and I want to understand why the bear is eating the berries, I don't need to know what, you know, what is the fundamental like, physical structure that is a bear. So, I think it just, and I actually was thinking about this for my talk tomorrow, because I talk about something like, something called a hard problem of life, and people usually talk about like, the hard problem of consciousness. But most neuroscientists don't care about what consciousness is, right, because they care about the functioning of the brain, and they want to make your brain healthy, and these kinds of things, and consciousness is a really hard problem. We have like no handle on it. And I think most people studying biology, you know, they care about the mechanistic details of their particular question, but life is a very abstract concept, and it sort of, it exists at a different ontological level if you want,or something, but it's just sort of in a different ballpark of questions. It's also like planetary formation and like gravitation, you know, yeah.   AW: I mean, I guess I totally agree with that, and I, you know, I have my own sort of set of biological levels that I work at, and yet, when you pose it like that, I really want to know, like what is life?  SW: Well I think everybody wants to know! It doesn't mean...  MM: You've already, I think you've suggested, I may be overstating or misrepresenting what you had said, but some of the points that you've made have been about, well let's think of evolution again. You've sort of just made the comment that there were maybe things like communities, which is different than LUCA (last universal common ancestor) usually conceived, so, is there, I mean, have you thought about the potential value of biologists, no matter your level, no matter your interests, what types of things it might do for biologists?  SW: Yeah, yeah, definitely! I mean, so, my quest is that there is like...quest, it's a quest, it's an epic quest, like you know, like I don't know, some video game or something. No, but like, obviously I'm really passionate about the problem I work on, so like, I really care about this problem being solved. I don't care if I solve it, I just want someone to solve it, and so, I really do view myself as just trying to like, make enough of a conceptual shift so people can think about it differently, so like, we as a scientific community can be part of some of these kind of questions, because they're not ones that any individual could possibly answer. But, the, but what I really care about is whether there is some unified explanation for all of life, and what I mean, like, from the origin, to understanding what the heck it is we're doing as a technological civilization, because it's a very bizarre state for, to actually like, be a thing that exists, like most people don't think about it, but like, especially being a scientist, it's really weird that we do science. Like what is science? It's such a weird thing, like there's like these physical things on the surface of our planet that are thinking about how the world works, and then they come up with theories, and then those theories actually describe the world, and then they can do new crazy things with that. An example I like to give is like launching satellites into space, which seems kind of like a mundane thing in our society now, we do it all the time, but in order for that physical process to exist requires knowledge of the laws of gravitation, which means that you have to have a civilization or something like a technological civilization with sophisticated knowledge of how its world works that it's understood the regularities associated with gravity, and then built technology to cause these transformations. That can only happen if you have that knowledge, so that's a kind of information that allows this new thing to happen. And so, I think that's a, that's very fundamental and very deep, and so I think like, if we had the proper theory for what these things are, what life is, that it would inform everything, from what's happening in the chemistry inside cells, to understanding, you know, the future of AI, because it's just about information and what information does, and so... So, I would, I kind of would consider all of these different levels that we look at biology as examples of that physics, and we don't think about it that way, but that's actually the way I've organized my research group, is they all work on like different, totally different biological systems, but the whole point is that looking at them from this unified perspective, hopefully we can get insights from one into another to try to figure out what that theory might even look like, and we don't have a clue what that theory looks like, so, but somebody has to jump in the deep end, pretend it exists, and then see if it does.  AW: So, you've talked about digital versus analog and how you sort of, the solutions to that problem. Do you want to say something about how that fits with the definition of life?  SW: Oh sure. So, I think the reason for proposing talking about digital and analog information processing systems is that in particular with the origins of life, there's a huge dichotomy in how we think about that problem. So, people tend to be very disciplined, specific in how they approach it, which I find fascinating, but like the leading hypotheses for origins of life have traditionally been genetics first or metabolism first, and the genetics first theory assumes that some molecule, presumably RNA, or something that can copy itself, emerged on early Earth, from some prebiotic chemistry, and started copying itself and undergoing an evolutionary process and therefore it was a genetic system. And then the metabolism first says instead, oh well, what life really does is harness free energy and so the first thing that life did wasn't necessarily evolution or copying information, it was harnessing energy from its environment and so the first living entities were metabolic cycles. Or, you can... AW:  And just to be clear, so, which of those is genetic and which of those is analog? SW: So, yeah, so, yeah, I'm going to get, yeah, I'm going to get there. So, the, so, the point I want to make about the disciplines is that most people that think about the genetics tend to be like molecular biologists or biologists, most people that think about metabolism come from physics or geochemistry, or like these kinds of backgrounds. So, you can like, you can almost clearly see the disciplinary divide there, and I think it's just because we're struggling to make inroads to like, what are the relevant questions to ask for origins of life, how much of life is still there at the origin, and how do we actually even get there? And I think probably all of these things are in part right, and what we really need is a more unified approach of thinking about life, but that has to be an appropriate level of abstraction, and so, from this sort of informational perspective, you can recast the genetics as being like a digital component was important early on, and metabolism as sort of an analog or more, you know, continuous kind of system. And then you can actually cast both in a common language and start asking kind of questions about them from that perspective. So, so that was really part of the motivation, and I have become increasingly convinced that the origin of life problem is actually a problem of unification more than anything else, and usually we have major conceptual breakthroughs in physics when we have unifications of very different things. And you can say that unification in a lot of different ways, you might say, well, genetics and metabolism have to be unified in some kind of, like, way of understanding both at the same time, or the way I talk about it in sort of like a much more abstract way is thinking about information and matter have to be unified, or information and causation is another way to think about it, but that there is some problem where we understand how matter and energy work, and we understand information in the abstract, but we need to understand those two things as a unified concept.  AW: Another trait of life that you've written about is that you can recognize life as the acquisition of top-down control over networks of parts that contribute to life, so can you talk about that transition? SW: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I'll give a little bit of background to understand, motivate why I'm thinking about it that way, but there's this kind of interesting thing... So, I'm trained in physics, and in physics, like the way that we're taught to think about the world is to try to reduce the world to like the most fundamental description of reality and the simplest, and it's usually a sort of very reductionist approach because you want to go all the way down to like, elementary particles, and understand like, all the component parts. And that's great and beautiful and elegant, and I absolutely, I love physics and what it's been able to accomplish, but that description usually tends to be one where you'll take the, what we call the micro-state, or the lowest level of description of a system, and then once you know what the micro-state is doing you basically say everything about any kind of level of description you might want to do above that, and usually like, the way we talk about levels is we'll say, well there's a macroscopic description, and it just means you don't know like, the position and velocity of every particle. And so, thermodynamics is sort of a classic theory that gets at that kind of thing, because temperature is a very good way of describing, you know, like gas of particles, but you don't have to know the position of every particle or anything to talk about something like temperature. When you get to life it gets a lot harder, because if you talk about those macro-scale level properties, those tend to be things that we associate like, with function, for example is like a relevant macro-scale property in biology. And when you're talking about those kinds of things, they actually influence the system. So, it's not like it's just some meta-level description where you don't have complete knowledge of what the micro-states are doing, so you're using it as an effective description. But I think it's actually fundamental to what that system is doing. And so, I can even just like, I mean, as a scientist, we're like, we're describing a thermodynamic theory, but then we use thermodynamics to go and do something in the physical world, so somehow that abstraction actually, you know, matters. So, that was my example of gravity too, is that like, these sorts of higher-level things actually become what I would call causally efficacious in their own right, and that's the top-down aspect. It's that, it's something that's not physically instantiated in any particular substrate -- it can exist in many, it can be copied between many, but somehow it actually can, in part, control the dynamics of the system, or, yeah. So, the top-down causation is actually that part of it.  AW: And if I just try to like, apply that idea to the origin of life on Earth, and I'm imagining, you know, sort of networks that are physically instantiated, and then I'm trying to imagine like, how does this top-down control, like what, how does that crystallize out of this stuff? So, how does it?  SW: Not sure yet! Yeah, ask in a few years. I actually like, I just got a project funded where like, we're going to try to get at that a little bit more concretely with like, actual experimental data and try to measure what information is doing in these like, intermediate stages between non-life and life, so I have a couple experimental collaborators -- Kate Adamala and Lee Cronin, that work on like, sort of opposite ends of the original spectrum for their systems, so the idea there is that we're actually going to go through and build a bunch of chemical systems and look at how information is structuring those systems to try to understand what's happening.  AW: When you say build a bunch of chemical systems, you mean like in the lab?  SW: In the lab. So, Kate, for example, works with synthetic cells, so she can build cells with biological parts but they're very minimal, so it might be like, you know, a couple of genes instead of like, hundreds of genes that we have in real cells, and you can actually track, you know, like what is information doing in that system, and then, Lee takes these complex chemical mixtures and he tries to start from like simple building blocks actually, they're not complex to start, but he evolves complexity into them by varying environments and using, he has like these robotic algorithms that he does like, these mini iterations of ensemble experiments to generate statistics over how chemistry is actually increasing its complexity, but like, going down these many different paths for chemical space. And so, so the idea is like, can we actually bridge those two things that try to look at them in this abstract level of like, what is the information actually doing. But I think that's the critical question about all of this, and actually, the top-down causation aspect of it is a very deep philosophical question, because a lot of people think that can't even work in practice, because there's no limit at the bottom for extra causal forces. And what I, I think part of the misnomer of that is people think there's a micro-state and a macro-state, and that macro-state is exerting control over its own micro-state, but that's not true at all. What's actually happening is, you know, I'm an information processing system, and when I look at the external world, I don't have access to all, to every degree of freedom in the external world. I have certain ones that I care about and pay attention to, and those actually become causal in my dynamics, because those are the ones that are, I'm internalizing and interpreting about my environment. And that's actually a kind of top-down causation -- it just means that I'm not coupled to every single degree of freedom. I'm coupled to a reduced set of degrees of freedom, and that's what I call information. And so, I don't think it's anything mystical, I just think it's just that we haven't really gotten to the bottom of what that is and how that starts happening. But I think it happens in chemistry at a certain scale of chemical complexity, it's just that the chemical systems become so rich in the possibility space, and so rich, just like if you think about like, you know, a folded protein or something, there's no way that like, the function is a small component of the system, and all the rest of the degrees of freedom don't really matter to the function, right? So, when you start getting those kinds of systems, then you have the possibility of information actually starting to matter. Now, how it can start to matter and why on Earth it actually did this weird thing that it doesn't seem to have done on Mars or other planets in our solar system, is a really hard question, but I think the first step is to get into this kind of conceptual framework where we can start thinking quantitatively about it and asking these kinds of quantitative questions, and then we're in this like, kind of, space where we're feeling out, you know, what does that even look like and mean and you know, starting to try to connect to experiment, and hopefully like, the theory and experiment will start feeding back on one another and we'll actually get some more concrete ways of talking about that.  MM: So, the, we weren't going to bring it up, but I have to bring it up in light of what you've been talking about... Where do viruses fit into the way we think about the... SW: Everyone always asks that question! MM: Well, the way that you, we had no plans to talk about it, but it's... SW: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's great! Yeah, no, everybody always asks. So, so, I think one of the biggest misnomers with trying to find life is to say a thing is alive, and we can draw a boundary around that thing. Like, that's just not what life is. In my mind, life is a dynamical process, and it's one where you have particular informational patterns that are like, structuring physical systems across space and time. And that's what life is. So, you can't draw like, a hard boundary around that process. And from that perspective, of course viruses are part of a living architecture, they're part of life, because they contribute to that kind of process. And so this goes, and so I mentioned there was a distinction between life and alive, and in my mind life is all of the things that are generated by this kind of process. So, like, people get mad that I think a computer is life, or a screwdriver is life, but those things literally would not be created without information.  AW: Yeah, well it's consistent! That's okay.  SW: Yeah. And then alive is the systems that are actively constructing things, they're the ones doing the information processing to actually build those things, and like, use internalized information to actually do the construction.  AW: That's a good distinction.  SW: Yeah, so I think there's, and both are kind of necessary for understanding life and what life's doing. They're very fundamental to like, trying to figure that all out.  MM: So, sort of like von Neumann's programmable constructor type of...  SW: Yeah. I love von Neumann's stuff on universal constructors. I think he was way ahead of his time. It's brilliant. AW: So, let's dig into that. Yeah, so, what is a universal constructor? SW: Yeah, so, von Neumann, I think, he was really inspired by Turing, but his whole line of reasoning was, you know, Turing was interested whether you could compute any computable function, and von Neumann was like, well that's interesting, but I'm interested in like, you know, real physical things, so, could you build a machine that could build any physical thing? Right? So, this is a really interesting question. Is it possible to make, have one device, or one thing, that could construct, build, any possible thing that could exist?  AW: And just remind our listeners when this thinking was happening, when was von Neumann doing his work?  SW: Yeah, so this was like 1940s, I think he died in 1950, and his book on self-reproducing automata was unfinished, and then it was finished posthumously by Burkes. But, yeah. So, this was very early, yeah, very early. And he inspired a lot of people to think about things very deeply. But yeah! So, this gets into...his real question was about building a machine that could reproduce itself, and so that's why he went into this idea of a machine that could build anything, because if it could build anything, it could build itself. And so, what he recognized though, was in order to build itself, it had to specify itself, which means it had to have a program, or some kind of information to tell it to build itself. And it's really interesting because there's some paradoxes associated with self-reference there, where like, if you're talking about building yourself you have to have an image of yourself, and then you end up getting into this sort of hierarchical loop. AW: So, that imaging includes the program itself, and yeah.  SW: Yeah, yeah. So, he kind of quickly recognized that you would, you know, you need an infinite storage space to actually specify all of the future generations. And so, what his resolution was was his idea of a universal constructor actually contains three parts. It contains the constructor, which is the thing that does the building. It contains the instructions, which specify how you make the thing, and it contains a third component, which he called a supervisory unit, which tells the system when to copy the instructions. And the copying of the instructions basically means to just make a second copy of it, but it doesn't, it's completely blind to knowing what the actual instructions tell the system to do. And that was actually very. It’s interesting because Schrodinger was able to predict the structure of DNA, talking about the constraints of the laws of physics for being able to have some kind of genetic heredity. And von Neumann kind of did similar logical arguments about what are the necessary conditions in order to have something that could self-reproduce. And both of them ended up predicting really fundamental things about biological structure before they were discovered. So, Schrodinger basically predicted that you need to have an aperiodic crystal, and DNA is an aperiodic crystal, and von Neumann predicted that you need to have something that can take these instructions and be able to build things, and that's sort of the architecture of having DNA be the instructions. When you have DNA copied by a polymerase, it doesn't care what the information in the DNA is contained, and then when you actually read out the DNA, you have something called a ribosome that can make, in principle, any possible protein. So, it's not exactly a universal constructor, but it's universal over the set of proteins. Right? So, it has that kind of logical architecture. So, it's really fascinating that that actually ends up being the case. And then, interesting to me, so, I'm a big fan of something called constructor theory that David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto have been working on, but Chiara wrote this really nice paper, basically doing what I think is kind of an argument like what Schrodinger did, where he talked about the laws of physics and what's necessary for properties of systems to exist, and she made the argument based on von Neumann's things that in order to have evolution with like, and the appearance of design with no design laws actually requires that kind of architecture and having digital information. And so, there's really this interesting thing, like the way physics is structured is actually telling us a lot about what life can and can't do, and what information can and can't do. It's just that people don't usually like, try to do these logical arguments to reason into it.  AW: Yeah, neat. So, just want to make sure I understand myself. So, you're not claiming that life itself is a universal constructor, you're claiming that this system of DNA and ribosomes and... yeah okay.  SW: It's universal over that. But there is an interesting... So, the way I think about evolution, which is very abstract, and what evolution is doing, is that if you look at the history over life on Earth, I think there has been an increasing number of things that can happen. So, if you think about what a constructor is -- a constructor mediates a particular task or a particular thing to be transformed into another thing, and it might be that it takes some materials and makes itself, or it takes the materials and make something else. And that's actually what a constructor is defined as in constructor theory. But if you look at the evolution of life on Earth, what I think is happening is that you're getting more and more constructors, or more and more things that can be constructed, because there's more and more information instantiated in those systems. There's actually an arrow of increasing number of transformations that the information on this planet can mediate, and there's no better example of that than our civilization and our imagination. Like, if you think about it, like science fiction, it's like, you know, actually, this is my favorite example, this is getting really abstract. Yeah, I talk to my students about this kind of stuff. But something that really fascinates me is, so through most of biological evolution, we increase the amount of things that can be done by recording history, historical information, right? So, we have a knowledge of past environments, and that allows systems to be more adaptable, and then they evolve the capacity to control those environments and make new chemistries happen and these kinds of things. But the thing about humans and what we do, we have something that we call imagination, and that's actually a really interesting kind of physical process, because we can actually imagine things that never existed, and then sometimes we can like, actually generate those things, right? So, when you think about like science fiction and like Jules Verne writing about rockets and things, like nobody thought those things could exist, but then because somebody imagined them, like, they actually like, they came into existence! And that's a really interesting kind of thing to be happening, and so, I think all of biological evolution has been this progression of information increasing what's possible, and you could actually talk about a physics that's sort of like an entropy over [UNKNOWN] in some sense, rather than in states that there's you know, more and more things that can happen in the future because of the particular information structure, and that, you know, us and our ability to have abstract thought and all of these kind of things just fit naturally in that framework. AW: So, would you consider the human brain to be a kind of universal constructor? In the sense that we can imagine anything, really, right? SW: But we can't build anything.  AW: We can't build it, okay. But we can build the thought of it in our minds, right? But that's not the same thing?  SW: No, it's not the same thing, it's actually physically instantiating it. So, I, where, I'm glad you asked that though, because where I was going with this with the universal constructor is I think we think of that as an individual object, but the way I think about it is that the biosphere as a whole has become a better and better approximation to a universal constructor, because the entire planet can do more things. You know, human civilization can do more things, but you as an individual really can't do that much. And so, but it goes back to this idea, information is really hard to tie to a physical object, and so, it's not like I can point to this thing and say, this is a universal constructor, because you have to talk about like, where the information is in the system and things. So, I think there's like, maybe biology and why it has this arrow (?) of complexity is that once you get the system going and you transition into this kind of physics, it's this unfolding of this structure that's trying to become, it's like becoming a better and better physical instantiation of something like a universal constructor, but it's, it probably, it would never get... It's an... So, David Deutsch has written about this but like, whether it's actually possible for a universal constructor to exist is a really interesting question, and we don't really have a good segue into that, because like, that says a lot about the laws of physics and what's possible, and we just like, I'm, approaching that question is really hard. AW: So, there's a related set of things about the history of life on Earth, and those are very major transitions that we've seen, and the complexity of life, so, those would be things like the acquisition of eukaryotic organelles, or multicellularity, or, you know, transitions to land and more complex ecosystems. So, do each of those transitions involve some kind of acquisition of energy, or a new use of information and a sort of new way of using universal constructors? Or...  SW: Yeah, something like that, yeah. I definitely think so. So, there's that really famous paper by Maynard Smith and Szathmáryabout the major transitions and associating them with changes in information processing and storage, and I found that work really inspirational from this kind of abstract perspective, and talking about, but I think, if I wanted to quantify a major transition, I would say that you had a new scale on the system emerge that actually became causally efficacious over the lower scales. So, and so, you should be able to actually quantify that by the information flows in the system. If you start looking at some macro-scale properties, that they become more predictive of the micro-scale properties. And so, I did a toy model in an A-lifepaper years ago showing that that kind of transition actually can occur. But, so, I think yes, it definitely has to do with information -- everything in biology does, apparently everything. I mean, that's the goal, right? Is like, to try to unify everything. But those are particularly interesting cases, because you have like entirely... And like, so, a good example is like, right now we seem to be undergoing a major transition where you know, like, most people are living in cities, and there's sort of like this globalization, and we have the internet and things, and so, it's really like the transition of like, you know, local societies as global society, and that's a very kind of top-down transition too, because now, like my actions as an individual are influenced by something about the global state of the planet, right? So, it's like, you can have an affect like you know, a particular emotional response, and billions of people at the same time on this planet. Like, that's never been able to happen in history, but it's because, like, we now have these collective structures, and they're difficult to point to, because they're not like a thing, and so that's why they're really difficult to think about, but like, society exists, it is a physical thing, it's just not, you know, an individual.  MM: So, based on this sort of this, well is there any way to get to the number of transitions that have happened on the planet, from sort of, you know, the basic ideas about top-down control? SW: Yeah, yeah, I think so. So, the way I think, so, let me see if I can articulate this well. But I think, like, if you want to, I think about life as like a bunch of partitions in a system, like, and those partitions are interacting. So, presumably, like, if I wanted to characterize you, I should be able to like, see how many partition, like, if I could look at you from this abstract perspective, how many partitions you have and how they're hierarchically embedded, like how many are like sub-partitions of another partition, and be able to say something about how many of those kind of transitions occurred. And I think that's sort of like, part of the origin of life process is that you know, the systems kind of had this partitioning of their like, in physically, like save their state space and also like their physical space, and those partitions became coupled and then you've got like, higher order partitions and yeah, now I'm getting very abstract and like, I, it's difficult to explain because there's a concept there, but like, and I guess this is useful also for listeners that like, when you're in these conceptual spaces, articulating things is really hard, but you have to push yourself there and like think about it to try to actually formalize it, and so, it's always a moving target, but that's fun.  MM: Maybe you want to pull back to the 20,000 feet? We often do a 20,000 feet pullback. So, physicists, chemists, have been incredibly good coming up with theory, and biologists just take a different approach, like we sort of start it. Do you think that there'll be theories in biology one day, as there are? SW: I hope so! Yeah, I think so! I mean, so, I really think that biology is, well in particular astrobiology, because I think you have to talk about observations of other planets, but biology is the next frontier in physics. So, people think, if people think about physics as being subject specific -- so it has to do with particles, it has to do with gravitational systems or like these kinds of things, and biology has nothing to do with physics. But biological systems physically exist, and I think about physics as a particular way of thinking about the world. It's just when you're a physicist and you're thinking about things, you're trying to abstract them to a very universal and powerful explanation, and those tend to be very simple because you want something that can describe many systems. But getting to that level is really hard, and I think we just haven't gotten there with biology yet, but my hope is that we will.  MM: Do you have any sense of what they're going to look like?  SW: Um, yeah... I do, I mean I do in the context of the whole conversation, because like, from my perspective, since I've been thinking about it for a while, like I've gone down this particular road thinking that the way I've been describing these systems is whatever that level of abstraction is. That has something to do with information in systems, like you can think about constructors, number of transformations that can happen in physical systems. If you want to count that, that would be maybe where like the laws of biology are is one way I say, what biology is doing is increasing the number of transformations that can happen as a function of time. So, and that's interesting because of this point that it actually literally makes it possible for states to exist that wouldn't exist otherwise, like satellites orbiting our planet, or quantum technology, or whatever you want to... AW: So, the flip side of that question I think is, are there going to be new physics that come out of, out of biology? And you know, Schrodinger himself suggested that in what is life, and I think earlier in the conversation you sort of alluded to that, that you as a physicist are going to biology because there's like this density of information that just doesn't exist anywhere else. So, I mean, what are the new physics that are going to come out of this?  SW: Right, so, so my reason for working, so, I was inspired by like, the founders of quantum mechanics or like, Einstein as a student. Like, they opened up entirely new fields of physics. And so, for me, I feel like we have quantum mechanics and we have general relativity, and there must be some theory that's equivalently fundamental that explains life and what life is. Um, and I think that, like going back to things I said earlier, I think that's information. And so we don't have a theory of information and what information is in the physical world, and if we did it would be explanatory of what life is.  AW: Has an implication that there's going to be some portion of biology and physics are going to fuse in the future and that they're going to become sort of the same field, really?  SW: Yeah, yeah! AW: Neat! MM: So, I guess, let's make it the kind of question, this is just what, like the virus one I know you're getting a thousand times... SW: Sure! No, it's okay, I like them! I answer them differently. MM: How common is life in the universe? SW: Oh yeah, that's a great question! Um, yeah, so I always answer this in two ways. I answer the like, optimistic, like Sara, and the one that like you know, the reason I'm an astrobiologist is yes, we will find life somewhere someday. And then I have sort of agnostic scientist Sara that has absolutely no clue, which I think, you know, you have to admit as a scientist. But I actually admit that from sort of logical reasoning that we have evidence for only one inhabited planet, and we wouldn't be on this planet observing that planet being inhabited unless there happened to be an origin of life on our planet. And so, if you actually... AW: This is the anthropic bias argument?  SW: Yeah, the anthropic bias argument. Um, but um, and so, um, so if you do like proper statistical analysis of those facts, one origin of life, our existence is contingent on it, then it's, um, equally likely that life is really rare and we're the only life in the universe or that life is very common. Like you can't, you actually can't distinguish those hypotheses. So, so, I am, but this also motivates me, I just, I think we have no idea if there's other life out there, and we should just state it as such, because I think we would reason about the problem better, because what I see in my field a lot is a lot of astrobiologists will say life is common, and they'll make arguments like, oh look how many exoplanets that are earth-like we found, so there's so many environments, life must be common, because there's lots of places for it to form, or life emerged rapidly on Earth, therefor it must be common because it must be an easy thing to happen. Um, and both those arguments are false for the reasons I stated previously, is that there's, there's literally no evidence, and we don't know the mechanisms for the origin of life. If we knew the mechanisms, we could extrapolate to how those mechanisms would operate on other planets, but we don't know the mechanisms. And so, without having a theory or an observation of another living thing, we literally can't say anything about the likelihood right now.  AW: So, so how much would it change the calculus if we find life on Mars in the next 10 or 20 years?  SW: It would change it significantly! I mean like, if there's two planets in our solar system that are inhabited, that means that life is probably really likely.  AW: But it, uh... SW: I mean, unless it had an origin from Earth.  AW: I mean, it seems like...exactly, so if they're related to one another, right? It depends on like, how closely related they are and whether we can, sort of, foresee a common LUCA. (Last universal common ancestor) SW: Yeah, yeah. So, that's why like, sometimes I say my biggest disappointment is if we found life on Mars and it was just Earth life on Mars. SW: Yeah, exactly. It would just, I mean it would just ruin it for me. Other people might be excited, ooh life can live on Mars, which is exciting, but it's not the same scale.  AW: So, given how far away stars are, talk about how are we trying to figure out whether there is life on other planets?  SW: Yeah! So, so there's a lot of approaches to that, and I work a lot, um, in the exoplanet community now, so I find their discussion fascinating about how to look for life. But the sort of popular, like kind of consensus thinking right now is that there is no particular smoking gun biosignature. Like a lot of times people used to think like, if we found oxygen in the atmosphere it would just be totally, you know... AW: Methane's another one.  SW: Methane's another one, and then there's this idea that oxygen and methane together, because they're a particular kind of disequilibria would be evidence of life. But the problem turns out to be much more complicated than that because we only have the example of Earth and we're trying to use Earth biology on other planets. But even if we take Earth, you know, and we do the metabolisms we know on Earth, or atmospheric gases we know biology produces and we put them in models of planets around other stars or with other compositions, the space is so huge that it's just littered with false positives of things that look like Earth-like life but are totally not biological. And so, the exoplanet community is working really hard to try to build models where like, you can actually definitively say this is life or not. But my personal thinking on it - and we actually just, I just led a paper on future directions in exoplanet biosignatures where we make this argument, it's one of many arguments in the paper - but my feeling is that we really have to move from this idea that we're going to look at a single planet and be able to identify its atmosphere and characterize that life is on that planet, to thinking about looking for life more statistically, and that like, and when we think about modeling planets or the observational... We can get really little data from exoplanets, like, like, almost nothing, like a couple molecules in the atmosphere and then like, you know, you might know a few features about the planet, but it's, it's very minimal. Um, and then, um, so we don't even actually have a tight constraint on like, the composition of these planets, let alone the biology on them -- like, we can't even like, we don't have models for the planets. And then we don't know what life is on top of those planets. So, it's a really hard problem. So, but, but, a lot of times when people do like, planetary evolution models, they can build like, a statistical distribution of what they think planetary composition would be like. And so my feeling is if we started doing statistical searches for life, and we had some models for like what we would expect for the distribution of atmospheric compositions, for example, based on no life on those planets, and then we like, see something different, we might be able to say something about like, and constrain likelihoods of life existing in an ensemble, and that we wouldn't have to rely on detecting life on a single planet and then knowing exactly what we were looking for.  AW: So, it makes sort of more probabilistic arguments about... SW: Yeah, basically. And a lot of people that are like, doing exoplanet stuff now are moving more in like basing inference approaches for inferring properties of exoplanets, and I think that we're going to have to do some kind of inference and statistical type analyses to actually detect life, and people haven't been thinking about it like that because there's always this implicit assumption that we know what life is and we'll know it when we see it, and to really think about it as a scientific problem, you have to completely change all of your conceptions about being able to recognize it, and you have to think about, you know, actually doing inference on a system and like, you know, trying to build up these models for like how likely life is on this planet as the valid hypothesis, and so, so I think the community is starting to move in that direction. I find that really exciting, because, um, like, you know, I always make these analogies with physics with astrobiology, but like, I think about it as, you know like, I want to know the distribution of life out there, not just whether we have life on one planet, so if you do these kind of like statistical searches, you actually can constrain with an ensemble, like how likely is it that, you know, a certain percentage of them have life. And that's more informative, actually, from this anthropic or these statistical arguments, for theory building or for like, you know, actually constraining what we think this process is, and how often it happens on planets and things.  AW: So, if there is life out there on other planets, how likely is it that there's also other intelligent... SW: Yeah, so, yeah, I don't know how coupled those questions are. From my perspective, like, I just have a gut feeling, and usually like, most of my science is initially based on gut feeling anyway, because you have to be passionate enough about something to like, try to push it and see if it's true or not. But um, but just my gut feeling is that once the origin of life, so the origin of life is the hard question. How do you get this process started in the first place? And I almost feel like it's the quantum to classical transition where you're talking about two different, totally different physics, and somehow you have to go between them. And so there's like, information doesn't really matter and suddenly it's like, everything. And how you go between those is really hard, but I think once that process gets started, it's like an unfolding process and it keeps building on itself, so I think, I think most planets would evolve toward intelligence, but...  MM: So, does that hold for consciousness too? SW: Um, I think so, but I, like, that's a really hard question too. And I, and I almost think, so, so, I think consciousness is a different problem from life, um, but I do think that they're kind of, they're related in some way, and so the way I think about it is like, so the hard problem with consciousness is why we have internal experience, and that's really hard because that you can't explain in any kind of substrate level narrative. There's absolutely no reason that we have to have an inside, or be thinking about the world. And from my perspective, the life problem is like, why is it that your experience would actually matter to the world, or any kind of internal information processing? So, they're kind of dual in some sense, one is like the internalization of like, you know, information and what it's like to be on the inside of that information, and then the other one is like, why does that actually have a physical influence on the world? So, I don't think they're wholly unrelated, but I do think that, that, right now, unification like, so, I think life will be solved before consciousness at this point. Consciousness might be in the next century. I think AI will help a lot with that. And then I think down the road, like a couple hundred years, the unification problem people will be talking about is consciousness and life, from physics. Like people were worried about GUTs right now, grand unified theories, like, pssh wait a few hundred years and get way more interested... Physicists, physics will get so interesting in the next century.  MM: So, you did, you brought up AI a couple of times, but not really said much about it. So, the way that you're thinking about life, what is it, does it say anything for how we might design AI, especially to avoid big problems with AI?  SW: Oh sure, yeah, so, so, I am, I'm interested in the AI control problem, but I don't know how to approach that problem yet from my thinking. So, I've talked to a lot of people in that community, and I'm intrigued by the problems that they have, but I also am thinking about it from a totally different perspective, so bridging that right now is difficult for me, but um, but I do think, I think... So, I think there's a lot of things that we think are unnatural about what humans are doing right now, like climate change - we think it's unnatural. But, if you look at the history of life on the planet, you know, life has changed the climate dramatically at a planetary scale many times. The only difference now is that we are cognitively aware of it and we actually have the ability to do something about it. And that's a very different system, but the climate change itself is not unnatural. It's a natural byproduct of biological activity. And so, I think AI also, people think it's so unnatural or our technology is so unnatural, but if I look at the evolution of life on Earth, all life has been doing is building increasingly sophisticated informational architectures. And so, I think AI is just a continuation of that process. And I also think it's a particularly interesting one, because I think, I think AI will be critical to like, actually identifying the laws of life in the sense that it's very difficult for us to see ourselves, but AI is not us, it's something we created. And so, they can actually see us in ways we can't see us. It's sort of like building like a, we built microscopes to see cells and telescopes to see the universe. I think AI are going to see life in a more fundamental way.  AW: And we just got to hope that they don't gain top-down causal control over us, right? SW: Yeah, and so, I'm very much more thinking that it's going to be kind of some kind of hybrid system. And I actually also don't have any qualms about like, our progeny being AI, or... AW: Despite my negative comment, I don't either.  SW: Yeah, or technology...yeah. Because I think, I think people, people think, oh we're going to be cyborgs in the future, we're going to be robots. But I'm like, but we created them, it's like, you know, they're still part of our lineage.  MM: Just another place to live, right? SW: Yeah, and I think, yeah, and to think that biology like, I mean humans are going to continue to change. There's no species on this planet that has existed the entire existence of the planet. All we're doing is increasing the longevity of the systems by building these. So, so, I actually like Nick Bostrom's, he made some argument at one point about, you know, all species go extinct, so AI is either going to make us immortal, or it's going to kill us, and those are like the options, right? But, but we're not going to last forever anyway, and so, so, I think it is critically important, and I really like all of the stuff like Future of Life Institute and stuff are doing to try to make sure that AI is positive for humanity, but, but, that's also hard to understand what that means. And so, so, one of the, so, I'm actually working with one of my students, and she's in Japan right now presenting on "Major transitions in planetary evolutions" is the name of her paper, but the idea there being that the planet as a whole has undergone like major transitions to informational processing structures, and we're undergoing a major one now, and AI is a part of that, and we need to think about AI as a planetary scale system, because our technology is a planetary scale system, and so we have to think about it how it fits in a planetary context and how that fits in the continuation of... And so, I guess from the control perspective, like, going back to my earlier comment, my philosophy of how I do science is always to try to find a question no one is asking to make an inroad so that we can ask things a little bit differently, and AI I think there's a lot of really great questions, a lot of really great intellects working on that, so I think what we're trying to do is make this inroad from the planetary science perspective, and sort of the astrobiology perspective. But that's very early right now, so maybe in a couple of years I'll have more to say about that.  AW: And I got to ask one more thing, which is, you know, at what point, how soon do you think we're going to consider AI to be alive?  SW: Yeah. I already think they are. Yeah.  MM: A screwdriver's alive, then.  AW: Yeah, well, well, a screwdriver's not alive, but, but, it's life, yeah, because it's not doing anything, but, I, you know, sometimes, so people are like worried when AI is going to take over and I'm like, it already took over, I mean like, like, so much of your life is dominated by technology. It's like, I don't think it's a bad thing, it's just a different thing. Like, it can be bad, just like anything can be bad. You can eat too much chocolate and it's bad for you, but everybody loves chocolate! AW: So, when is AI going to have consciousness, in a sense? SW: Well, that's a different question. That's a totally different question. And, like I said, I don't think we understand consciousness. I don't, I'm not entirely sure if... I think you have to have the physical media right for consciousness, and I'm not, I don't know, I don't know.  AW: Maybe computers aren't designed in quite the right way yet in order to facilitate that?  SW: Yeah, yeah.  AW: Because of connections, and there's not enough of a simulation, so the neurons, or...? SW: Yeah, so for example, like, it might be that like, people building, you know, more complex chemical systems actually build conscious systems first before silicon chips, just because of the dynamic possibilities available in those systems. So, so, I think, I think, yeah, we don't know enough about consciousness for, and I think about consciousness a lot, but it's a periphery problem for me, because I'm mostly focused on the life problem. So, I don't think I have something super concrete to say about that except that we don't know what consciousness is, and people often convolute intelligence and artificial intelligence with consciousness, and AI is not about consciousness. And, you know, we have a difficult time assessing consciousness in people, so how are we going to do it in machines? I think that's, it's a really hard problem, and I think people kind of mix the issues there a loMichael Garfield: Thank you for listening.

40,Episode Details / Transcript Transcript produced by Podscribe and edited by Rayyan Zahid.[Time Stamps start at the beginning of the interview, not the episode:] Michael 00:00In the sort of like, human and personal, and just ask you about how you got interested in this work? How you got involved? How you became a scientist? What drew you into this field in the first place? Natalie 00:16Sure. That's the question that I actually get a lot and have recently been asked by a few people and I always have trouble answering because to me it's just so obvious that it's an interesting question. If you know what I mean? I think all of us have been thinking about this for eons. And on a personal level, I feel like everyone that I know has been asking those questions, right? Are we alone in the universe? How did we come here in the first place? How did we emerge from seeming nothingness? And so, those are questions that I started asking myself around the same age that everyone else that was probably like 10 or something.And I just got obsessed with those questions. And I thankfully was brought up in a sort of scientifically minded environment with a lot of supportive people around me and got given books about astrobiology, the few that were there. Cause it was quite a niche field in a way and still is in some ways, but kind of started or continued talking about those questions over and over again. And when people would ask me what I wanted to be, when I grew up, I said, astrophysicist, they didn't really know the word astrobiology at the time.It wasn't necessarily as widespread and just kept being interested in those questions. Like how does life emerge from non-life like that transition is something that fascinates me. And I think it's very linked to the question too, of how different life could be in the universe, because it's all based on that initial emergence and then link to other questions. Like how would we find it if we looked for it? How would we go about going on another planet or using remote detection techniques to even look for those things, if we don't know what we're looking for?So, that's kind of what got me started is just this fascination, that curiosity that everyone kind of has, and I wasn't deterred from pursuing it. Michael 02:03And then how did you end up at SFI? Like how did your path and research get you into this conversation and conversations that you've been having with your various research collaborators? Like the 72 hours of science piece, which I hope we get to talk about on the podcast soon, y'all speculated on a tri-parental alien civilization. What got you there? Natalie 02:26Yeah, sure. I guess once I was interested in those questions, the next step was, going to university and things like that. And I decided to major in biochemistry, I was in the UK, so it's not quite majoring. Like you just focus on one subject really. And I kind of thought that biochemistry was a merge of biology and chemistry, which seemed like exactly what you would need to study to do something like astrobiology and kind of understand those relationships between chemistry and life. It's not at all that it's much the study of life as we know it on earth, obviously.And proteins and like metabolism and things like that, which was not exactly what I was looking for, but laid the groundwork for understanding how life works on earth. So, it wasn't a waste of time. And then I was like, okay, enough of that, I know how life on earth works to the level that I need to. And so, I was interested in kind of going down a level, I don't know if, if people on a podcast have been talking about this at all, but a lot of people talk about this hierarchy of scientific disciplines. And sometimes people phrase it in the sense of like, one's more important than the other. That's not what I mean.But if you study something like biology, it's actually based on chemistry because everything in biology is made of chemistry, but chemistry is all physics and physics is all math and there's like a whole road of things. And so, I wanted to kind of go down a level into the chemical realm. And so, I pursued my PhD in organic chemistry, which was prebiotic chemistry. I was interested in how does life emerge on earth or how did it emerge on earth? And we can come back to that if we want to. But I started, I guess, looking at how things interact on a molecular level, but that didn't quite satisfy me either.I wanted to kind of go a deeper level and not necessarily into physics, but I guess more into this theory kind of realm and wanted to explore these relationships that lead to certain emergent behaviors in life, I guess. And so, these general properties of life are something that people in astrobiology are interested in. And I know Sarah Walker has been on this podcast and my supervisor, Chris Campus as well. And so, that got me looking into their work because I was really interested in that kind of approach to the problem of like this bigger picture approach.And so, I started reading a lot of that and contacted various people, but ultimately the interestingly, the way I found a job at SFI was through Twitter. So, I guess that's thanks to you. And I'm not really super active on Twitter or anything, but I was kind of just searching keywords, looking for a postdoc. And I found an ad for theoretical astrobiology. That is exactly what I’ve been looking for. Those are the keywords I was searching and this popped up and it's the position I currently have. It is funded through this grant called the laboratory for agnostic biosignatures and that's a subject that I’ve always been interested in in astrobiology because I think it's very linked to these general properties of life.And the emergence of life in general is how do we look for life if we don't know what we're looking for? And so, the position was kind of both that like a more applied part of it, which is actually like, how do we look for these things, but also asking questions about like, what are certain properties that we think might be universal to life and things like that. So, my work now is kind of on both of those sides and that's how I got involved with the SFI community. Michael 05:52That's actually the perfect place to dig in. I wanted to talk about your contribution to a conference last year on Mars, extant life. What's next, the search for life on Mars and you and your collaborators proposed a number of these different agnostic techniques, these approaches. So, this is, I think this is a really good entry point for people. I'm always the one bringing up the science fiction on this show, just, some of my favorite works are like tours of speculative proposals or just how radically alien life could really be, not just inorganic but like holograms made out of magnetic vortices, the most bizarre stuff.But of course, the question that all begs is how would you even go about identifying these things? And so, you have a list here and I would just love to go with you down this list, which, we will provide links to these abstracts as well as to the end conference summary that you and a large number of collaborators worked on really interesting stuff. But let's just start with that. What would be possibly the most intuitive or like low hanging for people, which is chemical complexity. So, why that, and then how do we go about looking for it? Natalie 07:23Sure. So, chemical complexity, I think is a term that's kind of intuitive for a lot of us. I think even if you're not in the field, you can kind of imagine what people mean by complexity. But I think that's a problem that a lot of people have SFI have is kind of defining what they mean by complexity. And I remember my first week at SFI, I asked people like, what do you mean by complexity science? And everyone gave me a completely different answer. So, it's kind of the same thing with chemical complexity. Like they're a bajillion indices out there trying to kind of quantify what we mean by that.How is a compound more or less complex? How do we define that? So, there's been recent work in the last few years done by some collaborators of our grant group in Glasgow. So, there's Lee Cronin. Who's been trying to develop this along with Sarah Walker, actually. The kind of theories of how can we quantify chemical complexity for the problem of astrobiology or other problems like that. And he's not necessarily the first to ever come up with the idea of an index like that, but it's, I guess trying to make it a bit more intuitive in a way.So, I'm not going to describe it in detail because I wouldn't be able to do it justice necessarily. But the idea behind this new chemical complexity index is using different building blocks. How many steps would you need to build the, that you see before you? And so, they give good examples of that. Aren't necessarily chemical to help the reader in their papers. For example, to build the word banana, how many subunits essentially in steps would you need and things like that.And so, the more steps you need to build something, the more complex it is. So, that's one way of looking at it and there are other ways of looking at it. And a lot are, are based on like different chemical factors, how many atoms does a molecule have or how big is it? How many bonds, et cetera? There are many different ways of looking at that compound. So, that's still not necessarily solved, but some people like Lee Cronin and Sara Walker are working on that. So, that's kind of one way of looking at chemical complexity. When it comes to how do we detect it?That's another matter. Cause how do you actually link that more like theoretical aspect of the complexity that you might see if you actually have the chemical structure of a compound. But when we go on Mars, for example, the technology that we have is not as advanced as we would need to identify compounds completely. And even on earth, honestly, it's quite difficult. If you have a mixture, a completely unknown mixture, it can be quite difficult to see what's in there on a molecular level.So, imagine doing that on another planet, right? The machines that we send on Mars, we're completely blind to what's there. And we kind of have to make use of those very simple techniques. One of them, for example, is mass spectrometry. That's quite popular because it's been used over and over again in different missions. It's called high heritage. That's what we call machines. It's been sent over and over again. It's kind of shown that we can fly it or we can sit on missions. It's quite popular, it's online, tons of missions. And so, that technique gives us the ability to kind of see the masses of what the compounds are in a mixture it's kind of in the name mass spectrometry.Some people like Lee Cronin's group again, have been looking at the relationship between a mass spectrum and the complexity of molecules that are in there. And I don't really know what stage necessarily they're out there, but that's an interesting idea. It's like, how can we use something as kind of crude in a way as a mass spectrum, to look for this property of compounds, complexity, that might be useful to say whether they're biogenic and origin or not, whether they come from biology or not. In our group, we kind of use that idea in a way among others of like, how can we make use of this simple tool of mass spectrometry to look for signs of whether this came from biology or not.And I guess the main question and the main problem that I'm working on is what do we mean by that? Like how do we know if they're a science of biology? Because traditionally in the past, a lot of people were just looking for some specific molecules that I knew are associated with biology on Earth. And looking at that, it makes sense that you would start like that. That you would start looking for things that, because that's kind of the only place that you can start in a way. But I also found that a bit frustrating, I guess, in a way it's like, why are we just looking for these very specific things?And so, that's kind of in the movement recently in the community, a small group of us are kind of asking us and we're not the first to think that, but this is an effort that's being funded right now. And so, a part of my postdoc is asking these questions and trying to come up with answers. So, there are several ways of approaching that you can either kind of look at it from the ground up. So, have theories of what you think might be general to life on Earth and kind of go from there. Or you can kind of go the other way around. It's like without necessarily knowing what the theories are from general properties or anything. You could just kind of look at what's different between biology and non-biology.So, between biotic samples, you can kind of look for some specific differences. So, obviously you'd have differences. Like there's no DNA in the biotic samples, but that's not really abstracting the problem, but then you could look at like leak, run-ins doing, you have very complex molecules in the biotic samples, whereas you might not have those complex molecules in the abiotic one. And they're a good theory as to why that wouldn't be the case because you might need, specific sequential addition of certain things to make a complex compound.But what we're doing in our group is also kind of looking more at the sample level as a whole. So, kind of at the community of molecules that are there. And we're interested in understanding if there are any patterns like that, in the distribution of the compounds that are there, that could be informative of whether it came from biology or not. So, it's kind of almost an ecological viewpoint of the problem of what's the relationship between these molecules and how would you detect that in something like a mass spectrum? Michael 13:43Yeah. So, to dive into that a little bit more, when you go into a little bit more detail in the conference abstract on the lunar and planetary science conference on agnostic polymer detection with mass spectrometry, it's like hindering on this observation that polymers, not necessarily DNA and RNA, but some kind of polymer is likely to be, and this is again akin to what Lee Cronin and Sara Walker are looking at, long, complex like metallic compounds and so on.But there's a note in here that the use of polymers allows life access to a larger chemical space, as well as reliably storing propagating information. So, in order to identify these, in order to light prosecute this hypothesis, you're involving some pretty kind of sophisticated techniques that involve machine learning. And I'd love to hear you unpack the actual methodology here for people and explain how you get from the raw data that's being transmitted from like the ExoMars 2020 Rover to something where you can say, maybe that looks a form of life that we have never recognized or identified before. Natalie 15:05Sure. So, there are kind of two aspects to the problem of polymer detection. The first one is actually detecting the polymers using something like a mass spectrometry. The second one is even if we detect it, how can we tell if that polymer might be coming from a biotic system or not? And so, the project kind of has these two steps. And the first one I think is, is the one that we put in the abstract that you were describing using those Fourier transform and machine learning and things like that. So, that's kind of what we're working on now.And so, what we're interested in is, basically polymers are like beads on a string, right? So, you have like these repetitive units that are strung together to make this kind of long macromolecule and life makes use of that a lot. DNA is a polymer, proteins are polymers. And so, what I wrote there about accessing a larger chemical space, that's what proteins allows us to do with all the amino acids using together and folding in a certain way. It accesses a different part of the chemical space and allows us to do these really interesting reactions like with enzymes and things like that.And it also in the form of DNA allows us to store information. So, the theory is that other lifeforms might also make use of that. But then the second part of the problem is how do we distinguish those polymers that have been utilized by the biotic system from those that are naturally produced in certain environments. Because polymers are also easily produced in different environments. So, to come back to the earth, for example, or even in meteorites, we detect polymers and things like that. And so, then it's a question of what kind of complexity do those farmers have.And that's something that we'll kind of work on in the future is trying to understand if there are certain aspects of polymers, perhaps in the sequence of the units that they have, or in the units themselves that they use, the compounds that they use to form those strings, that would be diagnostic of coming from biology or having been through the funnel of biology. But the first problem is how do we even detect it in the first place? And so, that's where those tools that I was mentioning come in, Fourier transform, auto correlation and machine learning.It's because since polymers are these kind of beads on a string structure, you'd expect them to fragment in a way that would show this repetitiveness in the spectrum. Because mass spectrometry, fragments molecules as well when you use it. So, there are tons of different techniques that I won't go into detail, but things like you shoot a laser at a rock essentially. And so, breaks up what's in there to some extent, and then you can do more interesting things like tandem mass spec, where you fragment a second time and things like that. But anyway, you end up with this kind of mixture that is kind of almost processed to some extent and shows the fragmentation of molecules.So, with these beads on a string, the polymers you'd expect to see because it's not just one molecule that's breaking up, it's a collection of them, otherwise you wouldn't be able to detect it. And so, you'd see like, where it broke up after two units or after three units, four, et cetera. And so, you'd see this repetitiveness and in the mass spectrum. And so, if you're an expert and you know that there are polymers in there, you can kind of see it with your own eyes. But the problem is with the resolution that we have on these machines on Mars and with, there's compression of data being when it's sent back and you can only do it once on that one sample and things like that.Like there are a lot of limitations. And so, there's a lot of noise in the data. And that's what we're trying to understand is how can we reliably tell whether there's a polymer in there and then next steps would be how long has that polymer, how many different types of units that have of it as different feeds and more information about the composition essentially. And the more information we have, then the more information we'll have for that second step of whether we can tell whether the polymer came from biology or not.So, one of the interesting things I thought about this process was that you were looking for to see if there was an underlying power law in the data. That there is that you're looking for it like a Zipf’s distribution, and that would help you tune the inquiry to determine the noise that you're getting from the instrument itself. I mean, because this is one of those things that's like, it's almost become a joke about like a complexity science that it's like, everybody's looking for the power laws, but like in this case it's like a really interesting kind of subtle application of this. And I'd love to hear you just unpack that a little bit more.I'm not sure I’ll be able to unpack it too much because that part of the project wasn't my work. But as I understand it, so my colleague Lu Chou was working on that of like what, what's the relationship between the noise and the signal in these spectra that we have. And is there a way to just remove the noise? And so, we did kind of look at the frequency of different intensities and peaks in there. And there seemed to be at some point like a sort of tailing effect, you had peaks initially that were quite high, that seemed to be the signal.And then as you'd expect kind of, there's less of the noise and there was this interesting relationship that looked like a Zipf’s Law. So, that's something that she explored for a bit to see if we could use that relationship to kind of mark off where the signal ends and the noise starts and kind of get rid of it as this sort of preprocessing step, but also as a way to recreate noise if we wanted to, because part of the project is also for us to use artificial data. So, we're kind of creating mass spectra of our own.So, we're writing code to create, well, if we have a molecule, how would it break up in a very simplified manner in this machine? What spectrum would it give us? And then can we add things like noise to kind of make it a bit more complicated for us and then work at the problem from that end? So, that's a way for us to kind of have a test bed, to test out our different methods before looking at the real data that we don't have yet from Mars, but before the data from ours, we could also use real data from earth, obviously, cause they're replicas of the machines that are sent on Mars that exist that NASA has.And so, we can kind of use those two to run different samples and like test out different things. But as you'd imagine, there's a limitation of how many spectra we can acquire that way because it's, well, COVID aside, it's a lot of manpower and like you're limited by how many samples you have and things like that. Like it takes a lot of time. Whereas if we're creating artificially these things, even though it's not, a perfect mimic of what we might have in the lab, it can help us test out different things. So, that's what we're doing now. And worked out well because of the global situation right now, but our work is artificial and using computers.So, that's great. And it means that because we can essentially create a lot of data, we can use things like machine learning. So, that's where that comes in is that we're creating like all these different spectrum of fake polymers essentially, and trying to either make them a bit more realistic, making essentially proteins and using like acids to construct these polymers, breaking them up, et cetera, adding noise or not, or we can make them even more abstract than just pick a number and add them together to make this polymer.And then we can put them through something like machine learning that one of our collaborators is doing, and look at what machine learning is able to do with this problem. Like whether it would be able to help us with this kind of detection problem in the first place and whether it can give us even more information down the line of how many units, the things I was saying earlier, how long the polymer is, how many units does it have and things like that. And machine learning is obviously a very powerful tool, but you also have to be very careful with it.And I am by no means an expert in it. Then that's why we have these collaborators who are also helping us and who know a lot more than I do, but it seems to be able to pick up really interesting information. And so, that's been really fun to watch as well. Michael 23:06I don't know how meaningful this is as an observation for our audience, but you know, this, I think points to like the structure of this research points to a common theme across human pursuits, which is, it sounds to me a whole lot, running a military exercise or practicing free-throws and a windstorm. You're looking for a limited number of encounters, ultimately, and a lot of this, the way that science of this kind is practiced is about, you said, it's about making the most of limited opportunities.Yeah. That does it sort of pours back into this question of how you're devoting your life and work to rehearsal for first contact, rehearsal for, preparing for anything. How do we prepare for any possible scenario or would like to tie in Melanie Mitchell's work? How do you get to levels five independence with a self-driving car? Like how do you prepare a vehicle for, all of these like extremely low frequency possibilities, how are you training your own machine learning algorithm for the unthinkable? Natalie 24:21Yeah, exactly. And in the case of space exploration, it's clear that as you say, there aren't many opportunities for any encounter and it'd be such a shame to spend all this time and money sending something on another planet and then missing something so obvious, but just because we didn't look for it. So, it also kind of ties into the whole point of agnostic biosignatures as a project is trying to fight that like the traditional way that astrobiology has been approached when it comes to life detection, which like, I'm not criticizing, it's obvious why it was done like that before, because that's kind of the only thing we knew, but we're past that now.And so, it makes sense to kind of abstract the way we look for things. Even if it's a simple abstraction and not completely agnostic, looking for polymers instead of looking for DNA. And so, that's the whole point of the project is to make sure that we don't have blinders on when we're going on another planet and looking for something that's so specific that we're missing all the rest outside. And I remember telling someone wants to conference who didn't share that opinion. I was trying to find a sort of metaphor and I'm not sure it's perfect as an analogy, but I was like, it's like, if you're going in a forest and you have a hatchet and you're told to look for humans as a proxy for life, go look for life.And by that we mean humans and you're chopping down trees to look for it. And it's like all around you, there's this beautiful life around you. And you're not even noticing it because you're so focused on just one thing. And so, it's just trying to abstract the search and hopefully we'll find something interesting one day Michael 25:56And, really, not to spend too much time on this, but this has some pretty steep, ethical concerns associated with it because obviously the history of the exploration of our own planet is a tragedy of the exact flavor that you just described. Oh, this continent is uninhabited by, people not even recognizing civilization while they're trotting over it. So, this is something that, I think should we make the kind of mistake that you're talking about? It's the kind of thing we would have a hard time living down there. It's really important that we get this right. Natalie 26:32Yeah. And that's both on the side of detection and of contamination and that's a big issue too, in the field of planetary protection. And there are a lot of people working on that. And I think it's very important. And as you said, there are a lot of ethical implications to that. And I think we need to take the utmost care to make sure even just where science like, to make sure that we're not contaminating our own samples with our own biology. Otherwise there's no point in us doing this because we'll just find life as we know it because we brought it there with us and it would be so frustrating if that ever happened.But also, you're right on an ethical point. Like I don't think personally that we have the right to go there and just completely take over the ecosystem that might be on another planet. And that comes back to things like also terraforming Mars, which some people are very keen on. I don't think we have the right to do that, but that's just a personal opinion. That could be enough. Michael 27:26I'm sure a lot of listeners know that was very deeply discussed. And Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy, that ends up sort of being the crux of that whole political argument through that series. And it's fascinating how those concerns and those, those debates on earth transpose into these other worlds. But, I want to bring it back to this question of how do we abstract life and you know, how do we think about it in the most fundamental ways and to link this to of all things, complexity, economics, and the understanding of an economic system as out of equilibrium as a form of metabolism on the surface of this planet, one of the other things that you and your colleagues discussed in this paper is looking for disequilibrium, redox, chemistries, and other instances, not of like the sort of components of life as we know it, but evidence of life has a process. So, how are you and the other people in this field thinking about that and pursuing that particular approach? Natalie 28:28Sure. So, I don't think I can necessarily tie it in nicely with complexity economics. Cause I can't pretend that I know anything about that Michael 28:35Smoke stacks. “Oh, there's an industry.”  Natalie 28:40But when it comes to looking for a disequilibrium, that is again, by no means a new idea, the way that we're approaching it is to abstract, the molecules that we're looking for. So, people in the grant are looking for this kind of exchange of energy as a way to show that there is disequilibrium and I’ll come back to why we're looking for that. And other people, including the group that I'm part of within this larger group is also looking for evidence of a metabolism at the molecular level.So, it's more coming back to what I was saying earlier about the distribution of compounds that you might have in a sample. For example, a specific distribution might be distinctly different from an, a biotic sample, no life because of metabolism and because life needs to have this kind of chemical network in order to function. And I’ll just caveat what I'm saying here by everything that we do in our research and that I do in my research is based on life as a chemical system and as cool as it is to know like theories of life as a hologram, that is something that artificial life community is working on.And it's something that I really want to get into more. And so, I'm trying to read more about that community. It's just a bit harder to look for it at the moment. So, I’ll just focus on chemistry for now and just wanted to put it out there because that's valid too. And it's very interesting. It's just not what we're doing right now, but why metabolism is a great question. I think it's one of the important pillars of life. And I think a lot of people would agree with that and, Sue Kaufman and autocatalytic cycles and things like that is also rooted in SFI history.And I actually like had read some of Stuart Kauffman's books before I was hired. Didn't even like connect the two together. Like I didn't even think about the fact that it was at SFI, but anyway, I just think that this idea of life and disequilibrium being so intertwined, that's something I’ve been thinking about more recently and a lot of people will state that life needs to maintain itself at a low entropy state. Like as if that was just like an obvious fact.And that always kind of made me wonder, and I was kind of thinking it was a bit circular in a way, because for me, it's kind of the other way around, it's not that it needs to maintain a low entropy, is that without having that low entropy state, it wouldn't be life. But that might just be the same thing phrase in a different way, but it's just kind of to point out that whenever you think about these deeper questions of what life really is, you usually get a bit lost in your thoughts or that's what I find like it's just so confusing and gives you so many existential crises.It's a very difficult problem obviously, but nevertheless, the disagreement we have in life are, are very linked and you can see that in the way that life briefs, for example, the gasses that life uses up and produces that links to gas at the planetary scale being in disequilibrium. And that's a clear bio signature on earth. For example, it's having things that co-exists in the atmosphere that wouldn't be able to coexist normally as in chemical species, that should kind of react together and form something, but they, we can detect them in the atmosphere.And so, that means that they're constantly being produced or used up. And so, that's a signature of disequilibrium, for example, on a planetary scale that is due to life. And that's something that people propose as a biosignatures for other worlds, either by looking for those specific chemicals species that shouldn't be coexisting with coats, things like oxygen and methane and things like that, or in a more agnostic approach, just looking for what species are we seeing in the atmosphere? What chemicals are we seeing and thinking about, whether it makes sense of like, what we're seeing is that compatible with a completely lifeless body, or do we need to invoke something like a planetary scale ecosystem in order to account for what we're observing?And so, that's a sort of planetary scale agnostic by saying nature. That would be good for like remote detection, for example. But in all these cases, it's really difficult to actually tell whether he came from life or not, because we don't necessarily know the null hypothesis. Like we don't know what the environment could produce without life. So, it becomes very complicated. So, for all of these things, we actually need multiple lines of evidence, brand new science, to be able to actually tell whether there is life or not, ultimately, which might still be more difficult than I'm describing.It sounds super simple when I'm saying it now, it’s like, just have a few evidence things and it'll be fine. But yeah, when it comes to disequilibrium, you can also see it at a smaller scale. So, these redox pairs that are mentioned in this abstract and the energy does being transferred between them is something that life makes use of in order to harness energy. And so, the ability to detect either a redox pair in disequilibrium or the transfer of energy between them would both be kind of valid ways of at least detecting that there's something there that's compatible with life. Michael 33:51Yeah. And, to link that back to the first part of this conversation, you mentioned elsewhere in this abstract, that if you're looking at chemical complexity, that there may be a threshold beyond which complex molecules are unlikely to form without that supporting biological machinery. So, really these, you said, these are just two different ways sort of noun and verb of looking at how do we detect these things. So, you, you brought up a life and aside from the fact that the idea is extremely cool and that there's a really cool conference going on for this stuff, you know, organized by former SFI educator, Juniper Lovato, shout out. Something that I find kind of interesting about the methodologies that we've discussed here. Some of them is that, you said, it requires the creation of enormous artificial datasets, which to me, I can imagine eventually tailing into a situation where we end up simulating complex alien life before we even find it.And this is, I hope a bridge we can walk across to the last piece. I want to, I want to talk about with you today, which is the paper that you coauthored in nature research scientific reports on adaptive properties of the genetically encoded amino acid alphabet are inherited from its subsets. So, this is like for anybody who is familiar with the writing of Simon Conway Morris, life's solution that really beautiful book, many, many people over the years have asked these questions about why it is that we see life take the shape that it has on this planet and asking these parallel set of deep questions about the balance in evolution, inevitability, and contingency, given a specific set of components.And in this particular piece of research you and your coauthors created, I love this an enormous set of xeno amino acids to ask this question of why it is that we have that like all life on earth today uses this very, very narrow slice of what is possible given the components that we have on this planet now. So, could you talk a little bit about the basis for this and then how you and your colleagues dug into this particular question? Natalie 36:17Sure. So, I’ll just preface it by saying that I joined this project that was being led by Jim Cleaves at ELSI a bit later in the game. And I worked there for about five weeks. So, I contributed a little bit to that project, but I think what the most interesting part of it was actually the papers that were published before that we built upon in this specific project. And so, I’ll try and talk about that a little bit, because I think that's, what's fascinating about their work. So, the work here is looking at whether the genetic code that we currently have with 20 amino acids, if there's a way for us to decipher how it was built from just a few amino acids at first, but the work that it built on was why those 20 in the first place.And I think that's even more interesting as a question in a way, and that there were more interesting results that came out of that in my opinion. And so, what they did there was, as you said, built this kind of huge set. I can't remember how many, but like thousands of amino acids and kind of process them in a way to have their like certain attributes of the compounds, things like molecular weight and how acidic a compound is or not, or how hydrophobic it is, these kinds of properties of molecules.And there are certain ways of doing that, coding, there's certain packages that you can use that based on like a certain structure of the compound, they can kind of predict those properties, even if they haven't been tested out in the lab. And so, the project that I joined was they'd already shown that those 20 amino acids, essentially the ones that we use in our biology, we're better at covering the chemical space and a random 20 from this xeno amino acid set. And what I mean by better, what they meant by better is that it covered the chemical space and I’ll come back to what that means more evenly and more broadly in the 3D space.So, the chemical space as they defined it. If I remember correctly, it was a three-dimensional chemical space based on the size of the molecule to hydrophobicity of the molecules. So, how much it likes water or not. And the PID isoelectric point of that molecule, and that was trying to capture one of the interesting properties of amino acids is that they have like different pKa’s and different to do certain reactions that are essential to proteins functions. And so, they're trying to kind of capture that through those three properties.And I hope that those were the right ones, but those, I think are the ones that we use at least in a follow-up paper. So, and I think I'm sure that they also looked at other properties and whether it, it, the results also applied. I wasn't there for that part. So, I can't speak for that. But anyway, it was just really interesting that, they picked 20 random amino acids from this huge set that they created, which also included the canonical amino acids, the ones that we use in biology. And whenever they compare those sets in terms of how much they covered the chemical space and how evenly they covered that space, they found over and over again that the 20 amino acids on those 20 together were, if not better, at least like among the best possible sets that you could have of 20.And the reason why even ness was something that they were interested in looking at is that's an intuitive notion too, is that you'd imagine that if you want to have 20 amino acids in your genetic code to build things like proteins and unfold and have catalytic activity, it would make sense for all those 20 to have slightly different properties so that you have, you can kind of maximize how you're able to use the chemical space. And so, that was what being covered with even is, and then the spread over the chemical space is also kind of intuitive is that it would make sense to kind of cover all the possible properties that you want to cover. Michael 40:08So, can I just dig in here just because I feel like part of my job on the show is just to send tentative, hypothetical feelers out to like the way that this research might inform research into other kinds of systems and listening to you talk about this and reading this, this paper, I couldn't shake the implications of this kind of thinking for other work into the, the diversity of team building, how you select people for a particular function.And then also how in studying, doing textual and historical analysis of, what survives history, what, what it is that we decide to keep culturally that something becomes canonical precisely because it suits a particular set of selective demands that like the reason that the Septuagint picked the particular books of the Bible that have been like leftover is canonical texts has something to do on a very fundamental level with why you don't want to put five identical people on the same team or why, we don't have a different 20 amino acids that are coded for by our DNA. So, anyway, just a stray thought. Natalie 41:25 Yeah, well, that's actually kind of what this follow-on project that I helped with was about, was whether we could actually reconstruct which amino acids might've been added in which order, and we didn't quite get there in that project. I don't know if that's continued in that group actually, but I think what that paper was about was whether there is a way to see whether if you start it with like three amino acids, assuming that life, or protolife had just three amino acids at its disposal, which might've been, the ones that are easily produced for by and the environment and things like that, glycine is a super simple amino acid that's assumed by most people would have been widely available.We can even detect it in space. So, it is just like easily produced. So, it would have been available to life or protolife. If you start it with those three, how do you add a four? And which fourth would make sense to add if you know, that those 20 are being used ultimately, and it's kind of that, it only makes sense to add this fourth because we already had those three and et cetera, the fifth one and things like that. And so, it's an interesting question because you can't just jump and go to the other side of the chemical space like that wouldn't really make sense and also happens that those molecules are probably more complex anyway and harder to me. So, there is this kind of question that you were saying the same as like building a team or the Bible apparently, Michael 42:44 Or, really like fan fiction. When does fan fiction become canonical? Like when, when it becomes useful enough to the audience of a particular franchise to have to like, to be able to build narratives that are able to explore a larger narrative space, but then there's, this paper talks about, brings in a, a scaling dimension too, which is why we don't have more than 20 and that you get, you get locked in after a certain amount that it becomes to grow the code in the same way that like growing an elephant at some point, it just not worth it to add more elephant. Right. So, I would like to hear you speak to that piece of it as well.  Natalie 43:26Yeah. The question of why we only have 20 or why we have 20 in the first place is a very interesting one. And I know there are a lot of theories and I don't think that our paper answered it necessarily, but it is very interesting. And I think in this line of research that I was part of, it was very much about what you said. If we're already covering the chemical space fairly well, what's the advantage to having extra amino acids in a way, cause you're already kind of covering everything you need. And there are extra costs to having more namely like the current genetic code is a three base fare codon.And so, if we have more, there is redundancy. I mean, there are theories as to why it was three and that limits how many amino acids you can have and things like that. And I mean, I honestly don't know if it is just a matter of the chemical space or if it is just frozen accident theory is also a good one. Just like that's kind of what happened at the point of maybe LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor. And until then it was just like frozen. And if you change anything, then it'll break down.But think for me, what really interested me in this work was the fact that the ones we're using were the best ones in that sense. And we also did this study wanting that in a way. So, I know that it's not necessarily the answer to everything, but I found it fascinating just to see that in the way that we were approaching it at least, or the group before me was approaching it. The answer was undoubtedly that the 20 amino acids that we're using now are a good set and there might be other ones that are as good or slightly better.I can't remember if there were slightly better ones, but that already know in the same ballpark. And why that was fascinating to me is that when I started the field and I had told you earlier that I was interested in this since I was like 10, I was very much of the mindset that there's no way life elsewhere would look remotely like ours. And it's just stupid that everyone is looking at carbon and water, and we're looking at amino acids. Like I was very against like the status quo and then like during my PhD and the origin of life community, and also during this work where in both cases, we showed that there are certain reactions for my PhD, for example, that you could do over and over again and in different conditions.And it will be a very, very similar outcome. Like some molecules just want to be made. And I hate when people in part want on tamale heels, but it is the easiest way of phrasing it, I guess. Michael 45:57Or material agency, which is the way that my humanities friends talk about this. Natalie 46:02That these molecules are just the natural product of that reaction. And so, they're more stable. They're whatever means that they're the outcome they are. And there's some obvious building blocks to RNA that are just so obviously easily made in different reaction conditions that makes sense that ribonucleic acid came about and there are multiple ways of looking at it and it's always bad to comes out. And I was kind of frustrated. Like I was just like, why is it that one?What makes sense too, our biology is making use of what was available. And so, what was available, must've been abundant and easy to make. And same with the amino acids. Like the ones that were easily made were probably the ones that were incorporated first. And because for some reason, our biology made use of amino acids and then proteins, then this genetic code arose because it was better at covering the space, but it's still kind of frustrating in a way for me because rejects a little bit that idea that life might be different, but it also doesn't completely because I think what's more important is what environment life arises in.And so, if we had a copy, an exact copy of the earlier, perhaps we get very similar life, we might get a slightly different genetic code. We might even not have discovered amino acids. Like there might be luck in this too, but it's kind of hard to tell where that chance element comes in. Was it really chance or was it just that it was what was around? But I think there are a lot of steps where you could kind of ask that question. So, I think if we rewind the tape life on earth would be slightly different, at least likely because even in the research that was done here with the genetic code, there are some other sets that are slightly, that are similar and that are equally good.But I think if we had, if we discovered life on Titan, then there would be no reason for it to be the same in a way, because it has a completely different environment. Like we're talking about like liquid methane and liquid ethane lakes with, with a crust, that's not like soil, it's ice and like everything is completely alien. And so, we'd probably find a super different and interesting form of life there. Michael 48:13Yeah. That disappointment though. I think it speaks to something that underlies this, you mentioned very early on in the call, the poly semantic nature of complexity. It's like everyone has a slightly different idea, but one thread that seems to run through a lot of them is, and I I'm constantly bringing up physicist Mark Buchanan's 2018 Nature Physics editorial on the bias for simplicity. I know a lot of people have written about this. This is something where our models of the world are parsimonious.You know, that Ockham's Razor is almost like a metaphysics underlying this work precisely because the world itself seems to be lazy in a sense, or, to even take it down a layer, even though it's hypothetically it's possible for all of the particles, quantum tunnel out of a glass of water, it's just, you're never going to see it happen. And so, we have that contingency, but because everything seems to be running downhill, we end up with a world, you said, that, we ironically, after all of this work, maybe we are more likely to find something like the world, the life we know out there.I don't know. Let's wrap this up. I really appreciate you taking all the time to talk. I know it's later in the evening over there, but I'm curious before you go to just know where this is pointing you know and like what's next on your horizon of research. Natalie 49:46Yeah. So, what I might say might be slightly contradictory to what I just said, but this bite, this disappointment that realizing that there might be a good reason why life on earth evolved the way it did. I still think that it's really important for the community to look past the one example that we have on earth and abstract our search. And so, part of the work I'm doing, as I said early on is kind of still this idea of how do we look for it. But I think what drives me even more is the bigger questions of what are these general properties of life.If you don't even think about life as a specific molecule, if you just think of it built of certain, what are the properties of these blocks in their interactions? Do we have to have complex chemistry? That's still an open question to me and I understand Lee Cronin's approach to. If you find something really complex on another planet, it probably came from life and that's kind of intuitive in a way that you would need these specific, enzymatic reactions to make something really complex. But if you don't find anything complex, that might not mean there's not life, perhaps.And I think that's a question that needs addressing, and that's something that I'm interested in is whether you could have a living system that's composed of like really simple molecules or rather the question I guess, is it doesn't really matter what it's composed of and is it's more of a process than a specific amalgamation of certain compounds. And I think that's how a lot of people think about it these days too, that life is a process and not just a specific system. And that's the question that kind of drives me. And I think it's also innately linked to its emergence in the first place.And so, that process of going from just a random chemical system, or without necessarily thinking of what the compounds are again, but just like a random bag of things, how do you get from that to something like us? That's always what fascinated me. I don't even remember writing about it in the letter that I had to like a motivational letter to go to university. And it was like, how do you get from just a bunch of star stuff to a system that's able to ask these questions about itself. And I'm sure other people are interested in that question more from like the emergence of thought and in us and like neuroscience and things like that. Natalie 52:05And that's super interesting too, consciousness, but what interests me is like that what makes life different from non-life fundamentally? What are those properties? Like, what are we? You just get into these like interesting discussions with people all the time during work calls, you'll just hear us being like, what is life? Michael 52:25I mean, I just remember when, when David Krakauer was a guest on The Astral Hustle Podcast. He actually confessed to being kind of a panpsychist to the extent that information processing seemed like it had some sort of interiority to it. And he was willing to extend it to at least down to the bacterial level. So, maybe it is the same question. I don't know, maybe. I mean, certainly that's what Tononi and Koch in their integrated information theory are proposing as crazy and unresolved as that is.Anyway, good luck with everything. I hope you find it. Yeah, that would be cool. Thanks a lot for being on the show. Natalie 53:07Yeah. Thanks for having me.
41,Episode Details / Transcript Transcript produced by Podscribe and edited by Shirley Bekins.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Well, this is going to be fun. I got to say, this is the first time that I have ever actually prepared a full hour's worth of questions in advance for this conversation, rather than just sketching something out and then sort of allowing this to go.CARL: Right, right.MICHAEL GARFIELD: But I really feel like there's so much here. And I hope that what I've gathered here is going to give you a unique conversation that’s going to be substantially fresh and different from what I'm sure you're going to be catching tons of … what I'm sure will be a punishing round of interviews for this book.CARL BERGSTROM: You know, this is the thing, we are doing a lot of these and this is the one that I've been looking forward to. I just told my son, “Oh, I've got to go do a podcast for Santa Fe Institute.” He's like … Santa Fe Institute, tell them I miss them!MICHAEL GARFIELD: Oh yeah, we miss ourselves right now. You know, it's nuts, I think we're starting a staged campus reopening here next week. And it's going to feel like the end of Big Fish, just down at the river and all your family's there. And it's like, did I die?CARL BERGSTROM: Right, so New Mexico had been doing really well. Are they still doing really well in terms of COVID?MICHAEL GARFIELD: We are overall. I mean obviously the reservations, there are certain areas that are being hit really hard, but this area, particularly Santa Fe County is doing pretty well and our governor has been very proactive and responsible through the whole process. Well, do you have any questions before we dive into this or…?JEVIN WEST: I have to leave right at 1:00 because I'm giving a talk for a thing. I think there's going to be 400 people waiting to hear and I'm supposed to be there at maybe even 12:55 PM. So, I guess it would be 1:55 your time, Michael.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Right, right, right. If you need to bounce a little early, that's fine. I'm sure we can…JEVIN WEST: Carl can hold the fort.CARL BERGSTROM: Well, tell you what, he runs. You asked me what it was like having to work with Jevin.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Perfect. All right. Well, let's just dive in. Carl Bergstrom, Jevin West, it's absolutely wonderful to have you on Complexity Podcast. I know that our time together today is limited because both of you are fighting the good fight nonstop these days. So, let's just dive in. I want to know neither of you started out in bullshit science. So when and why did this become such a big deal for you? Why did you decide to let it command so much of your time and intention? Please talk a little bit about the work you were doing before and the work that you continue to do in related disciplines and how they're connected to your work on the dynamics of misinformation and how to navigate with due amounts of skepticism our very, very confusing society.CARL BERGSTROM: I had kind of a journey that I think really set me up precisely for this, which is that I wrote a PhD on animal communication and on deception in animal communication and on the strategic issues and the game theory about what keeps communication honest. And we know animal communication is honest to some degree because if it wasn't honest, then no one would bother to listen. And if no one bothered to listen and then no one would bother to send signals. But instead you walk outside and the huge fraction of your sensory experience that you're having outside, whether it's the colors of the autumn leaves or the bird song or the tail of a deer as it goes running by…all of this is signals that evolved for the sake of conveying information.So, somehow nature has found these ways to keep information honest. They've evolved honest mechanisms of signaling. So that was what I worked on as a PhD student, but went from there and started working on epidemiology and studied epidemiology as a postdoc and spent a decade doing emerging infectious diseases and trying to prepare for situations exactly like the one we're facing right now, as a faculty member. And that got me very, very interested in thinking about how things spread on networks, because diseases spread on networks.And that turns out to be really focal in understanding disease transmission. Then we saw social media come along and all of a sudden it was the same networks again, and things were spreading on networks, but what was spreading on networks was bullshit. And so that really struck me as something that was going to be a huge problem and something that we would have to face. And it brought together the deception and network spread and with the sort of zeitgeist as to what was happening around this time in our society. And that was my path. Jevin, you want to…?JEVIN WEST: Yeah, for me, it's both personal and professional. So, I grew up in a community that wasn't very good at calling bullshit, partly because it really was taboo to question some of the organizations and cultural leaders within my community. But also I don't think that we're very well trained more generally. I don't think it's unique to where I grew up. I think it's common actually in some cultures. Let's say, in Korea, for example, you don't question your elders. I mean that's certainly something that doesn't work well, if you're a copilot in a plane and you're saying, actually I think you're wrong about what you're reading and where we're landing. But it's also professional for me too because growing up in that kind of environment really drew me to science because science provides a mechanism or a structure for going about calling bullshit. And so through the work that I did actually working with Carl and others and just thinking a lot about the role of technology on science and society, it's very much what my department does, where I live into.It just seemed like technology was making it worse too, and not just culturally, but the technology itself was making it worse. And then there was the rise of Big Data and there was all this excitement around Big Data. And I was one of them and Carl was highly skeptical as was I. Although I was teaching it and also selling it to students to go into because there was good paying jobs for it. But there was this confluence of technology trends. There was this rise in looking to technology for answers to everything. We don't need anything. We just need lots of data and lots of algorithms and lots of computers. And I think Carl and I were kind of getting fed up and I think we did have a lot of practice as professionals, reviewing papers is a great way of working on these skills. And I think Carl and I thought, this is the most important thing we could be teaching the students. And then after we created the class, there was this thing going on in the world too, this rise of misinformation after 2016. And then we're finding, Holy cow, it's linked to absolutely everything we're seeing with the pandemic. We're seeing it with the election. And so, both Carl and I are sort of just devoting our careers and our personal time to doing this.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Okay. So both of you actually headed directly into two of the big questions that I had for you. And I think let's try to tackle them one at a time. One of them, I'm just now realizing, Carl, this is insane. I ended up at SFI instead of doing paleontological research because I was kicked out of academia because of some of the questions that I developed in an animal communication seminar my senior year of undergraduate study led me into these profound investigations for which I could find no place in graduate school in 2005. And one of them was David Krakauer who has worked with Martin Nowak on the evolution of syntax. And then the other one was your work with Michael Lachmann on costly signaling and evolutionarily sustainable strategies of lying and truth-telling.CARL BERGSTROM: Yeah, absolutely. Wow, that's amazing so I ruined your career.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah, you did. Thanks!CARL BERGSTROM: I’m sorry.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Indirectly, you know, eventually I drunken-walked my way back here, but you know so here's this question, which is lying is an evolutionarily sustainable strategy. In some sense, we have the boy who cries Wolf dynamics, false signals flip over to me and they're opposite, sarcasm becomes meta-ironic. We allow lying leaders to keep going at it because we “know better.” There's this issue of fake news also traveling faster than debunking because debunking takes time and bullshit doesn't. So like is there any way to actually rid the world of fake news or is that really beside the point? I mean is our job to keep nibbling away at the edges of an ever-growing amoeba forever? How do we at least get our priorities straight around this? And where are the thresholds at which point we need to change our tactics from how we respond as the recipients of bullshit to how we punish cheaters at the source?CARL BERGSTROM: You want to take that one, Jevin? You’re the optimist.JEVIN WEST: Well, I'll tell you, I am becoming less of an optimist nowadays. Because when you look at the techniques for those professionals, I'm going to call them professionals that spend their days trying to sow confusion, to trying to sow a sort of fomenting emotional reaction to everything that you read online. I think that people are, I wouldn't say giving up, but when you look at how these interviews of people that are posting things online, I'll give you an example.There was a chiropractor here in Washington in Woodinville who pushed out a Facebook post around the decline or the lower numbers that the CDC was reporting. And they weren't the only ones sort of talking about this. There were other tweets that went viral. This particular tweet claimed that there were only really 9,000 deaths approximately. CDC was over-counting because of these co-morbidities. And they didn't really understand what comorbidity meant that if you die of a heart attack because of COVID, it's still COVID that's causing it.This reached all the way up to the leader of the free world, to a tweet. And after this person was interviewed, the person basically said, Well, it doesn't matter that it's not true or whatever. It's that I have my freedom and my constitutional right to be saying these things. And it was just, there was no allegiance at all to truth. So, it's those kinds of things that actually make me more of a pessimist, but I'll just end quickly, and I'll turn over to Carl about why I'm more of an optimist overall. And that's partly because we've been through this before in time when Carl and I liked to always look at some old quotes or look back in time when there were these big jumps in information technology, when we had the printing press and when radio and various other forms of information technology came along, there were worries at those times just like there's worries now.And actually, it's only been a short amount of time since we had and played around with this powerful tool of social media 2.0. So I think we can sort these things out and over just the last four years, there's been tremendous efforts to start to push back. You're even seeing the platforms pushing back a little bit. They're tagging tweets of the president, which is surprising. They now have policies that are much more specific about what they allow and don't allow. So having that allows them to tag and take things down. I mean, I think they're, we're moving in that direction.Of course, it worries me and that's why I work on it, but I still stick to my optimism. I have more optimism than I do pessimism.CARL BERGSTROM: Yeah, I'm going to counter that. So, I've been talking with Joe Buck Coleman who's a postdoc here at the Center for the Informed Public and works with Jevin and I. And Joe and I, not completely tongue in cheek, have been thinking about the Fermi paradox. And the Fermi paradox is, you know, why, if there’s intelligent life everywhere in the universe, why have we not heard about it? What happened to it? Where did it go? And one solution that people proposed to the Fermi paradox is they say, well, intelligent life eventually develops atomic power and atomic weapons and destroys itself. And Joe and I think, no, they developed social media.MICHAEL GARFIELD: You know that’s not entirely off the mark from another…Michael Lachmann, Cris Moore, a few other people posted that piece on how optimally encoded signals are indifferentiable from black body radiation, which is something I know…CARL BERGSTROM: Okay, one of my favorite papers of all time. And as you know, you probably know it even made its way into a science fiction novel.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah, and then Edward Snowden was talking about it when he was on a podcast with Neil deGrasse Tyson, like this idea that maybe the solution to the problem you're posing: Fermi 1 issue is incoherent society. But then Fermi 2 issue is that we get so good at encryption that it's just indistinguishable from nature. But that’s kind of a tangent maybe…CARL BERGSTROM: That's a lovely tangent. No, so I mean I think that the problem that you pointed out is an enormous problem. I think that social media is extremely dangerous because what social media does is, I mean, I'm not saying like ban it or something like that because that's not how we operate as a society. I'm just saying it's an existential threat to democracy and we would need to figure out what we're going to do about this.Because social media is basically designed to amplify content that is engaging, not content that's accurate. And so everything about the user experience that's built in and then the rules of how things spread and then the way that, Jevin always points out, the way that the algorithms are designed to find content that is likely to keep you engaged rather than content that's going to keep you well-informed.All of these things contribute to a situation where you can have the rise of movements like QAnon at sort of unprecedented levels. And this is an enormous problem in my sense. It also leaves a fantastic opportunity for adversarial attacks, right? Leaves you open to injection of disinformation from foreign adversaries and the likes, and we’re extremely vulnerable to that. We don't understand how humans make collective decisions once you give them social media. We have a lot of thinking in theory about how humans make collective decisions in a democratic society and by voting paradoxes and all of these things. And we don't really have any adequate theory of what happens once you take all the computers in the world and you link them together and then people start sending dumb s**t to each other and resending it and resending it. And all of a sudden who's controlling what I hear about the world? It's no longer editors and producers who have background to do this, it's my conspiracy theory uncle. And that's the fundamental challenge that we're facing.MICHAEL GARFIELD: That points to the follow up question I had about this, which is that it may be, there is a kind of an equilibrium point at which the unifying rhetoric of the web in the nineties is challenged by this kind of thing. And we end up seeing what we're seeing now, which is that the web is splintering, and that people are sort of circling up their wagons a little bit. And so there's this question about how does the incentive landscape shift in order to accommodate these challenges?So, I know that one of your animating questions you mentioned in your biography on the website, in your study of evolutionary dynamics is why don't cheaters exploit and undermine communication by sending deceptive signals? What are those cases in which they're not doing this? If we look in the natural world, how can we look to prior evolutionary solutions for examples of how we can structure our networks and the incentives in those networks in such a way as to mitigate bullshit rather than just deal with it?CARL BERGSTROM: That's a fantastic question. I don't know if it's bio-inspired solution or not, but I think one of the places that we can really bring in a lot of leverage is by thinking carefully about reputation and the role of reputation. Because I think reputation is actually increasing in importance over the last 10 years or so, rather than decreasing in importance, which is, you know, perhaps a bit of a surprise given some of the other features of an anonymous net and crowdsourcing and all those other things. But you know during the COVID pandemic, I think in particular, as we try to figure out where to get information from, reputation plays this extremely important role. I have a friend John Clippinger who in the early…JEVIN WEST: I was just going to mention Clippinger.CARL BERGSTROM: Yeah, in the early 2000s John Clippinger was at the Harvard Berkman Center, and he was obsessed with the notion of the importance of reputation in online communities and in how this was going to be absolutely essential to structuring online communities. And he was very interested in also preserving privacy and anonymity. And so, he wanted ways for reputation to flow obliquely between your different online identities, so that you could be members of different communities, for example. And have these non-overlapping, non-traceable circles, but have your identity, nevertheless cryptographically verified so that you had reputational incentives to be a good actor, the moment you logged onto a site under an anonymous name, and that he thought could make a real difference in the world.And, you know, John was just always talking about this and I kind of thought he had a one-track mind about it. And I didn't quite understand why he was so obsessed with this. And every single damn thing that the man said was right, which is really frustrating to admit.JEVIN WEST: Well, and here's a couple of things that we're seeing right now where that's kind of playing out. First, we're seeing a little bit in the academic world. So when you see a little bit of this drop in the role that journals play and pushing out papers, we recently did a study looking at places like the arXiv where you'll see top rated papers by top authors, sometimes just not even going into journals anymore because their reputation is enough to carry it. There are examples on the internet, like the Stack Exchange model, the Stack Overflow model, where individuals get reputational credit for answering questions thoroughly. Those individuals are getting good jobs because of it too. I mean a lot of the technology companies will recruit individuals that do well and have high reputation on Stack Overflow. So, I do think this idea is important but the thing you mentioned about circling the wagons, there are some concerning things too. There's the rise of new platforms like Parler, which is just essentially based on, I don't want to say fully because it's not the case yet, but I mean basically Twitter for one political party. And that is an example where they're splintering not only within platforms but among platforms as well.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Oh, wow. Okay so you both just, you're doing this for me, this whole thing. So, you touched on two points. I wanted to anchor deeper into this question because we're in a hall of mirrors here. And if you want to look one layer of reflection deeper into this, one issue is network-based reputation, new systems for that at scale. And then one is the issue of politically motivated bias and politically motivated reasoning. So you mentioned very early in the book that sometimes bullshit both what you qualify as the old school kind and the new school kind isn't precisely false, so much as it is nonsense disguised as sense, as many listeners might remember from the hilarious new age bullshit generator website.So, this isn't a direct lie so much as it is the presentation of a facade of believability in order to acquire some kind of social reward.CARL BERGSTOM: It's a very good definition of bullshit by the way.MICHAEL GARFIELD: But this is what fiction is, explicitly. I'm reminded of the expert level of verisimilitude in the work of authors like Michael Crichton. And it seems like we want on some level to be sold on bullshit. Why is this? What purpose does a nutritional requirement of bullshit serve for us evolutionarily speaking?  I'm thinking of the placebo effect but then also of Mirta Galesic’s work and others at SFI who have looked at politically motivated reasoning as a way of saving us time and energy, a kind of compression algorithm so that we can collaborate efficiently with others in our social units without having to verify absolutely everything we hear secondhand. And then you have people like philosopher Regina Rini at York University who wrote a paper on deepfakes in the epistemic backstop, arguing that the ability to convincingly counterfeit video and audio recordings brings us back to a pre-modern state of dependency on hearsay we acquire from individuals we consider trustworthy, which is the situation not unlike this issue of this documentary, Mirage Men on Amazon Prime.It's absolutely terrifying. It's about military disinformation campaigns to convince Americans that they are privy to secrets about government contact with UFOs in order to cover up much more mundane secret projects like illegal nuclear testing. So one consequence of this is that everyone in the military hierarchy, all of whom were in a rigid system on a need to know basis, end up believing counterfactuals about UFOs in both positive and negative directions, that they do or don't exist, because they're implicitly trusting their commanding officers who are themselves often completely mistaken.So, like what the hell do we do here? It seems as if the solutions that were coming up for this are themselves sort of vulnerable to the same exact exploits that were the problem to begin with.CARL BERGSTROM: I think this gets at an issue. So you asked why are we evolutionarily vulnerable to a lot of this kind of thinking? And one thing is we're very, very good pattern detectors. That's how we as generalists make a living in the world. We observe nature. We observe patterns in nature, and we use those patterns to, whether it's to find food or whether it's to manage our social interactions or anything else. And so, we are constantly observing patterns, generating hypotheses, verifying those hypotheses. And that's what it's like to think as a human. And the problem is, of course, rules of thumb that tend to work very, very well, sometimes don't. So one of the ones we write about a lot in the book is the thing, I observe A, and then later I observe B. And so I'm going to infer that A causes B and you know, this can easily get you wrong because if you observe that the geese migrate and then a few weeks later, the salmon come up the rivers, you just say, “Oh, well the geese are calling the salmon up the rivers” and so on. I mean that's actually interesting nutrient cycling stories there, but we'll leave that aside. So the problem is that because we have these set of biases that can cause us to sort of self-deceive.The other thing is that then when you take organisms with those sets of biases and you drop them into a very different kind of communicative environment, one that involves the potential for amplified spread and sort of exponential, sort of explosion of ideas going viral and such on the internet. Those biases may be kind of dangerous ones to have. And so, the problem sort of exacerbates there. And then you get these ideas around tribal signaling, tribal identity. So, these are Judith Donath’s ideas at MIT Media Lab. And Judith writes about the importance of when you get on the internet and you're spreading information. Maybe I really don't like Trump and so I see some story that says he sold the Washington Monument to a Russian oligarch. And so I retweet that thing, and I don't give a damn whether you believe it or not. I'm not trying to inform you about it. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to signal, Hey look, I'm one of you. I'm one of the people that has this set of political beliefs. And that's bullshit in the sense that we talk about because I'm telling you about myself while pretending to tell you something about the world. And I don't care whether the thing that I'm trying to tell you about the world is true or not. That's irrelevant to the message I'm actually trying to send. But the problem is that message on the social media system takes off and has this life of its own, and then becomes these alternative facts in these alternative worlds that we were talking about earlier, where you get this fracturing of systems and so forth.So, I think that's another piece of what happens there. We're very, very good also with these reasoning skills. We’re very, very good at talking ourselves into believing things that we want to believe. And so we are able to use confirmation bias and some of these other tools. We can cherry pick the studies that if it's COVID, we can cherry pick the studies that support the stories we’ve had in the first place and convince ourselves that we've been right all along. So, that's another piece of the puzzle, I think.JEVIN WEST: So, I'll just say a couple of things about the efficiency side of things. I mean there are certainly times where bullshit has utility in human communication and maybe broader animal communication. Because if my wife shows up with a new sweater and it looks terrible but I tell her that it looks good. I don't have to waste time, you know, necessarily dealing with the repercussions of telling her the actual truth. And she's fine. She, maybe, she knows it's a terrible sweater and she can move on, and we don't have to waste effort in dealing with all of that.But I also think that if there were punishments for those bullshitters out there that were egregious, that would be helpful. But there's no punishment right now for that. In fact, if you bullshit enough, then people just say, “Well, they’re bullshitter.” I mean, of course, thinking about some of our political leaders, then it doesn't really matter. “Well, it's fine. I know they lie a lot and that could be a lie at this time, but sure I mean whatever.” So, I think what that does these strategies by which you just give people mutually conflicting information and at large volumes, and you're just constantly contradicting yourself. You don't know what's true, then you have to retreat into local information and local information can only give you so much. If only trust my neighbors, my friends, and my very small, small digital neighborhood, it's really difficult for me then to rely on more global information things from institutions and leaders and gatekeepers. And really our system, democratic society, depends on our ability to access this global information as well as local information. Right now, global information is just sort of becoming less and less important. You can't really trust it. So, you have to retreat to local information. What the repercussions of that are, at a system level, remains to be seen, I guess.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Yeah. So this is something that I talked about with David Krakauer in our Transmission series when we were talking about mass extinctions and market collapses and so on. And how this is, you know, if you look at like the Chacoans here in New Mexico. They didn't just disappear. Their society broke apart into smaller units that were able to manage the latencies. You know, they had less latency in the communications network. So, I'm thinking about this in terms of everything that you've just said, links to the conversation I had with Geoffrey West in episode 35, talking about cities as social reactors with a ratcheting crisis-innovation loop.And then in episode seven with Rajiv Sethi on how we end up falling back on stereotypes and other cognitive crutches. As you were just talking about this, heuristics, Carl, as a way to again, save time in situations like when you're meeting somebody in a dark alley and you need to act quickly without the opportunity to really think through this. You end up requiring a stereotype because you don't want to have to check the chair every time you sit down. So, this is the world that we have because of social media and social media there, in that sense, is basically a dark alley where none of us have time to actually sit down and get to know one another and break bread with somebody.And it's preventing us from properly establishing common priors. So like in this way, it's understandable why these, you know, Twitter for Republicans or whatever would emerge out of this situation just because it's less insane making in the short term, but it's also kind of more dangerous in the long term. So, there's this balance here. I guess my question is how do we slow down enough in an accelerating world in order to both manage being able to adapt to the rapid pace of things at one level, but also the network latencies that occur from trying to address things at scale?How do we actually reason about what we're reading when the news cycle seems to want us to respond right away to something that it might take three days to actually sit down and fact check?CARL BERGSTROM: The first thing to recognize is that the news cycle itself is bullshit. So, the news cycle does not, things are not happening as fast as the news cycle wants to tell you. The news cycle, the 24-hour news cycle, of course, is a creation of a marketing system that's trying to get you glued to the television so you'll watch ads, which is a familiar problem today. It's just not a television set anymore. So I mean, I remember looking and seeing tickers running across CNN that say things like “breaking news, jury selection to start in two days.” And it's like, okay, first of all, no one gives a s**t. Second of all, you know, it's in two days and third of all it's been scheduled for three months. Like why are you running this as a breaking ticker? It’s to give me that little dopamine hit for me so that I'm sitting on the couch. So, things don't happen that fast and we don't have to accept that pace. I think that's one really important thing is to recognize that we're being sold a pace. And it's not that the world is happening at that pace. And we see that so strongly in COVID. This has been a real problem with the pandemic is that COVID, especially when people are starting to adjust to this, but especially in March, COVID triggered our schema for crisis, right?And we've got this crisis schema where things break very, very fast. The world changes radically. We need to know what's going on up to the minute. And we're thinking about things like natural disasters, does the hurricane hit, you know, come on land or not, thinking about terrorist attacks, you know the whole world changed when the second plane hit the tower and thinking about the acts of war where you don't know what's going to happen in the first Gulf War. And then all of a sudden, the bombs are falling over Baghdad and the world changes. And so COVID triggers our schema like that. And so, people become glued to the media and they try to get more and more fresh information.You know, yesterday’s newspaper covers are not sufficient. You need an unsourced rumor that someone named Joe Mega1234567 tweeted 15 minutes ago. And what happens is as people get pulled to trying to get fresher and fresher information, they ended up massively degrading the quality of their information because it hasn't been adequately vetted. It's subject to disinformation injection and all of these other kinds of problems. With something like COVID, this is particularly problematic because nothing changes rapidly on that scale.Occasionally a government will do something stupid and put a stupid policy into place, but our understanding of the disease is unfolding on a very different pace. The pandemic itself is unfolding on a very different pace. It's all statistical and yesterday's information, good information from yesterday is infinitely more valuable than garbage from right now. So, I think one of the things we have to do is to step back and break away from this notion that there is this increasing pace of information that we need to try to keep up with. There may be an increasing volume and that's a separate issue and something Jevin’s thought about a lot in terms of how do we deal with the fact that now we've got more people doing science than ever, and we've got channels that allow us to communicate that science at all stages of the process. We don't have to filter everything down and package it as a single final published paper, but we have open science and how do communities work within that?But I think that's part of my answer to your question. There is just simply to recognize like, Hey, wait, we don't have to accept this premise of velocity, if you will.JEVIN WEST: And Michael, I hate to sound too simplistic, but I think we need to improve media literacy for a generation, from all these generations that have never really had any real training in this. And I'll give you a specific example of just what a little bit of media literacy or civic online reasoning could do. I sort of actually liked the term “civic online reasoning” better because it's about civics. It's about reasoning and it's certainly online. So this idea of deepfakes or synthetic media is really scary for good reason.And it scares people when you tell them for the first time but just by telling them and just letting them know now they're aware. Now they’re aware and then we can have this discussion at a collective level to decide what are we going to do about this. But the fact when it’s in that stage that they don't know. Carl and I talk about this, it's in this transition period where the technology all of a sudden lands in society and most of society doesn't know about it. And I think it's that that scares me. I think most of society doesn't know about …and I think we're all included in that, the repercussions of this new technology. So, we need to spend more time on education. We need to spend more time on research. Policymakers need to come to the table, researchers, podcasters, you know, everyone, we need to talk about it. So, I think that's one big thing that we can do. And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently, and it's nothing new or profound, but what the online world, especially in this web 2.0 world that we live in, has brought to us is…it sort of dissolved geographic boundaries. And before web 2.0 and the internet, you would break into maybe like groups, neighborhoods, or countries or counties, and you were constrained by those geographic boundaries and you sort of made teams, or you even joined a team.Maybe you didn't want to be a team but you were on their team. And then there were maybe fights, literally fights between them. But now those boundaries don't really matter. There's these new fiefdoms being formed online and how those battle in these information warfares, how that sort of then can be buffered by the actual physical world is interesting to me. And so I think with new policies coming mostly from the European Union around the control of these platforms and the control of people's data and the ways in which we can communicate across these platforms and what the platforms can do, all those things happening right now will sort of determine how these boundaries online either match up or don't match up at all with our cultural similarities in the geographic and the physical world.CARL BERGSTROM: That's sort of what you're doing full time as the director for the Center for the Informed Public.JEVIN WEST: Yeah, no pretty much. Yeah.CARL BERGSTROM:  Can you tell us a little bit about that?JEVIN WEST: Yeah. So, what we have going at the University of Washington where Carl and I…we're part of something pretty special. So, we received funding from the Knight Foundation to start a center devoted to this very issue of misinformation and disinformation from multiple pillars, not just from research, but education, community engagement policy and likely journalism as well. And the way I've seen it for a while, it's been inspired by a person named Sam Gill who's one of the head people at the Knight Foundation, is that a hundred years ago in the early 1900s, there were no public health departments. I mean, there were a few that started popping up and people thought, Oh, that's a good idea maybe we should have them. And can you imagine now universities and medical schools without a department devoted to public health? And so I really think possibly in the future that many university campuses will have centers devoted to this issue of information quality, misinformation, disinformation, the kinds of things that we're talking about right now.So, when we talk about the health of human populations we'll also be talking about the health of information in the worlds in which we spend most of our time now. And so we have the center and Carl and I, and several other researchers that are devoted to this have now developed a team of postdocs and researchers and made collaborations with industry. We actually have literally a phone call away from many of the big tech companies. So we've been doing some research, for example, looking at various ways in which search results show different results based on where you are in the country or who you are, what age and other things.And then we can actually almost literally call up Google and say, by the way, there's a bunch of ads on your platform you're not supposed to have and so they're making changes. We have this new project called the Election Integrity Partnership, which is launching on September 7th, working with Stanford University where we are going to be monitoring misinformation around election integrity. Integrity, not that Trump said this or Biden said this but around the integrity of elections. So, it's these kinds of things that I think a center like this can be devoted to. And it's to think deeply about the questions that we're talking about right now but have a place for people that have ideas and they don't have to be academics.They can be journalists. They can be policymakers. They can be your neighbor who has a great idea about how to deal with this crazy new world. We're trying to try to make it survive so we don't go extinct and we can communicate with other planets in the universe.CARL BERGSTROM: Bad idea but anyway a separate issue…MICHAEL GARFIELD: Don't go, Stephen Hawking on us. So, this is, once again, you've led me into the follow up questions I had about this. One is that in the book you discuss how new school or data-driven bullshit can be particularly effective because many of us don't feel qualified to challenge information that's presented in a quantitative form. This is exactly what new school bullshitters are counting on. To fight back one must learn when and how to question such statements. And yet, I have heard so many scientists claim that it does not fall upon them to teach lay people or even experts in other disciplines, how to understand and check the basis of their claims, about how, for example, the latest time this came up for me was in a conversation with someone about the machine-generated reconstructions of what news outlets were calling a black hole photograph and how this proves anything about prior hypotheses about gravity and relativity.So like whose job is it anyway, in order to educate the public about these things so that we can collaborate in the kind of hive minds that you're talking about? How do we actually assign that accountability to the peoplein whose hands it belongs, and then kind of relatedly with respect to verifying this stuff? I don't know. I think I may or may not have sent you this over email in anticipation of this call. But I just came upon a really interesting project. It's not affiliated with SFI in any way, but Public Editor by Goodly Labs, where they're trying to create an online editing and review system that allows the public to openly assess the credibility of news articles and organizations and share their results with the world.So they're having citizen scientists label points in an article where an author successfully avoided or fell prey to inferential mistakes, psychological biases, or argumentative fallacies, and then Public Editor computes a credibility score for the piece. So, they have a compact data-rich credibility badge along a news article, hyperlink that appears in reader's newsfeeds and search results. So that sounds like one of the most promising opportunities, but then again, that's just like a massive project of volunteers that are all sort of themselves arguing in a kind of Wikipedia kind of way about what is and is not real.So, I don't know what are your…that's a big chunk to bite off but what do you think about all that?JEVIN WEST: Well, yeah, be careful about the Wikipedia shout out, Michael. Because I have been just, well, I'll just from my own standpoint, I've been amazed at how well these volunteer efforts can go. I see Wikipedia is one of the few lights of hope on the internet in this world of misinformation, it tends to work amazingly well. If you would have asked me this 15 years ago, I wouldn't have believed you. But anyway I just wanted to jump in on that particular… but I think Carl, you were about to say something.CARL BERGSTROM: I mean just whose job is it? I work at a public university. My job is to serve the people, not only who are enrolled in the classes, but to serve the people of the State of Washington and by extension serve the people in the United States and the people of the world. So, it's absolutely a hundred percent my job to do this stuff. It may not be a part of my immediate research program in some narrow research question. You know, Michael Lockman and I are working on costly signaling stuff that when we're trying to solve some set of equations that may not involve explaining things.But if you look at my job in a holistic perspective, it absolutely is my job. And people have to decide for themselves whether that's a job that they're taking on or not when they move into an academic position. But you know, one thing we can do of course … so a lot of my research lately has to do with studying what I call the new economics of science. It’s basically thinking about the way that the institutions of science influence the…and the norms that we have influence, you know, create incentives for scientists to behave in certain ways and then take…And then those incentives influence the things that scientists do, the research questions they choose, what gets published and then ultimately our understanding of the world. So now one of the things that is an issue is that in the past, there have not been strong incentives for scientists to have public engagement. This is the sort of Carl Sagan phenomenon, right? I mean, people, it's sort of, it's a cliche, but you know, Carl Sagan was never adopted into the National Academy of Sciences. And some people say that’s because people didn't like the fact that he was such a great popularizer and that was actually a negative and so on.We've got to change that, it is changing. I think especially younger generation of scientists understand the power of media and of social media, and they have the desire to do more than advanced science in isolation but to actually have an influence on society in various positive ways. So, I think that as we can change the incentive structure, you know, from within which is a decision we get to make because we create it. We were all, you know, you can't say, Oh, scientists are doing these dumb things because they have this incentive structure placed on them from the outside.It's like, we self-govern at all kinds of levels. And so, if we think that's important, we can start rewarding that in a whole bunch of different ways. And maybe it helps to have some people go out and really take their careers in that direction and try to do this aggressively, which is something I've seen Jevin do, for example.JEVIN WEST: Yeah. I couldn't agree more. I mean it's for those scientists that don't think it's their responsibility. They might want to look at some of these trust indicators of the public around universities and even scientists. And I think it's more important than ever for their jobs and for funding, at least at state institutions. I mean, we don't, you know, unless you’re Harvard and you're basically a hedge fund running some classes or whatever. I mean, you don't have to worry about money and support if you don't want it, but for us at a state institution and just me as a communitarian and as a scientist or someone who loves science, I think it's one of the most important roles I can play.So, I think it is, the onus is on us. And I definitely think others should pay attention just because the sentiment, at least right now, maybe it's transient. I hope it is transient, but there is a lot of negative assessment certainly among the political right of scientists and research. And it's our goal go out and tell them how good it is or how important it is for society and how they can become participants in all that and helpful participants. And looking for that example you have, you'll have to send it to us, Michael. This badge marking, collective sort of marking of when statements are correct or not.I didn't quite fully understand it yet but it sounds super interesting. So please send it.CARL BERGSTROM: I mean SFI has known this for a decade. This has been a core part of SFI’s mission for a very, very long time and it's something that's really admirable. We see the same thing being brought forward with what David is doing with the Interplanetary Festival and with some of the other things that he's organizing. And I think scientists just have to step up. Yeah.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Well, it's, once again, you've proven that you're like telepathic because you anticipated my next question, which was to step out a bit and to get into this issue of the science of science and, you know, the incentives that are shaping the way that we actually do research. Sid Redner has that piece on sleeping beauties. Some pieces, some papers just take decades before they're actually extensively cited, before they actually land somewhere. You know, someone has an idea that's ahead of its time. And so, that is a big thing at SFI. How do we create a space, a kind of a cradle, a nurturing environment where fundamental research that is not driven by the desire for popularity or the desire for a particular goal-oriented funding. You know, how do we actually create a space for those kind of questions?Because ultimately, yeah, there is the incentive for truth speaking, which is one thing, and then there's the incentive for truth seeking, right? And so, the fact that our very understanding of reality is in large part shaped by where everyone else in the herd is directing their gaze and where we follow that raises this question about, you know, like Jevin. I know that part of your work is on developing maps for large citation networks in order to understand the evolution of scholarly ideas. So how does that kind of dynamic and how does that kind of research template into the understanding of everything else that we've discussed on this call, which is how do we know what is true independent of the fact that everyone else's is gazing at it, I guess? These two issues feel very intimately related, and I just want to hear you two take the ball and run with it.JEVIN WEST: Yeah, no, no, they are totally…just another great question. And Carl very much…he sort of helped create some of the main techniques for doing some of that mapping of science. And I think they're totally, completely connected. So when you talk about the reward systems and the metrics we use in science, where it's a citation or it's a download from an SSRN, you know or arXiV or whatever, it's the same thing in broader society where journalists have to go to their editor and say, I had 4,000 downloads for this article.I only had 200 for this one, even though I think this was probably more important for the world to hear.  But Hey, I got, you know, this is how many thousand I got for this other one. And it's those kinds of things that are changing, are sort of clouding out or sort of pushing out those sleeping beauties, really…those more nuanced discussions, the more deeper questions, the more fundamental science. And it's one reason I've always been a huge fan of, of many reasons, of SFI. And I mean that genuinely. The last time I gave a talk at SFI, I kind of embarrassed myself and talked at the beginning of the talk about how, when I was an undergraduate, I drove from Northern Utah down to SFI.There was a conference on networks there, and I met many people I still talk to this day and at the conference, I took some time and I walked up to the old location of SFI and I didn't go in because I was so afraid. It was like looking at a cathedral. It was only a small building at the time...MICHAEL GARFIELD: The monastery!JEVIN WEST: Yeah. It was a monastery. It really was. I mean, and that's what it was, and you know, I still think of it that way. Yeah. But it was because of the way that SFI treated big questions and some of them were crazy questions. I mean, really some of them were out of this world sort of questions, but really, it was one of the, it was one of the places that really sort of captured a lot of the science that I was interested in and not even just the questions, but the way that it was going about it.And so I think in similar ways we could take that and we could apply it to some of these issues on social media and reward systems for news. And the way that we share information, I think there are clear similarities, but when we talk about the science of science, I will say this, and obviously I'm partial because I work in this area. And so does Carl, but I really think we're going through a stage in science where we'll look back a hundred years from now and it will be one of those big changes in the way that we communicate, the way that we reward. Also, there's so many examples happening just right now, everything from like preregistration to open science, to just the way that we share data and improve our replication methods in the way that we, we do that from step one in the science process.There are so many things that are changing right now and the way that we even fund science, there's a lot of interesting, innovative work going on right now. So, I think this, the science of science, we need to be thinking about it now. And if you're a physicist or you're a biologist, it is time to contribute to that conversation because I think we're setting the stage for science in a digital world in a way that will have long-term effects.MICHAEL GARFIELD: So, I know that you have to go Jevin in a minute. If you don't have time to answer this question, maybe we can just throw the ball to Carl. I want to thank you both and, you know, in anticipation of a hasty wrap on this call, for taking the time with us and for managing to squeeze two hours of this into one. But so everything that you've just said, basically reminds me, I tend to think of these kinds of things in terms of entailed metaphors and mythology and so on. And I'm reminded of a great conversation. My friends, JF Martel and Phil Ford, had on their show, weird studies about the role of the fool in the tarot deck.You know, that like, who is the fool? Why does this character keep showing up? And you think about, you know, being willing to stick your neck out and call bullshit on something that everyone else considers important or considers true. This is like the child calling out the fact that the emperor is not wearing any new clothes. This was why the King had a role for the fool in the first place in the court. And very much just for what it's worth, I feel like the fool at SFI. So, it's sort of like a microcosm of how SFI is the fool in the larger practice of science but it's an important role, right?To be the guy like bringing up science fiction stuff in these conversations and so on. But so, this really comes down to the question of how do we encourage those who are able to approach these questions with a beginner's mind with fresh eyes? How do we give them a role to speak in this conversation? And part of that means this is the last question I have for you, which is how early can we realistically start teaching people to call bullshit. I mean, developmentally young children do need to learn to trust their elders. You know, many critical thinking faculties don't come online until later anyway.So what is your most optimistic vision for an effective pedagogy and for skepticism in a world where children are exposed to all kinds of insanity through their family’s devices before they're even in school?JEVIN WEST: Well, I'll quickly say this and I'm going to turn over to Carl because I do have to jump off this. First of all, this has been so much fun. Michael, anytime you want to talk on podcasts, off podcasts, when we get to the post-COVID world, please come to Seattle, come hang out with Carl and I. But quickly on the pedagogy thing, I think we can go early in your thing. I have an experiment going on right now with my eight-year old and my six-year old, actually, he just turned nine.And they can do this. Actually, they can do it. It's not a pre-registered, it's not approved by IRB. But I think we can do…but there are efforts right now. Actually just in the last week, I've had three or four conversations with national organizations that are really trying to push this kind of thinking, at least in the digital world, specifically around reasoning, critical reasoning in their digital worlds.There are slight differences than maybe in the physical world, similarities too. But there are efforts at doing work in that right now. I look at the Stanford history group that Weinberg runs that I think there's really some interesting work there. So, I do think we can go earlier than you think. And I will say this, you are playing an incredibly important role because you're sort of opening up the questions, making it fun and making it wonderful. And I mean wonder and wonderful. And it's my kids. That's what brings them into science and to thinking critically, it's not the rote memorization that we see too much at universities.So yes we can make a difference, but it's because of things like this, Michael. So, thanks a lot for having me. Carl, why don't you take us across the finish line and it’s been so much fun, Michael. Take care. Bye.CARL BERGSTROM: Yeah, I agree with everything Jevin was saying. I think we can absolutely start this in middle school as a specific curriculum, as a critical thinking curriculum and where you're actually teaching people a combination of critical thinking, data reasoning, media literacy. Those are sort of the pieces that I would want to be there.The same themes can come in at elementary school very, very easily and can be worked through and just to help people learn to think in those ways. So Jevin and I have been working with Pacific Science Center here in Seattle, developing some online exhibits around these kinds of themes. And when I've looked at them with tweens and kids of that age, they love it. It's really, really fun. You know, there's things about, you know, misleading data graphics and 10-year olds, 11-year olds can look at these things and they know enough about what a bar chart should look like, and they don't necessarily know what's wrong with it when they first see a misleading one. But then they see one example and boom, you know, they're just…Then they see the second example and the online exhibit says what do you think of this? And then they say, look, dad, that's like…you know! I think that's a really, really exciting thing for people to be able to do. By the time you hit high school, I think this is just a sure winner. There's nothing that's more interesting than being able to call bullshit persuasively on adults when you're a later teen, right. Because you know that they're full of s**t.That's your starting premise. And if you can actually prove it sometimes that's absolutely delightful. So, you know, we've piloted this in a number of high schools, and it goes amazingly well. I'd love to see eventually a way to expand this out and do it on a much broader scale as part of a high school curriculum. It would be super fun.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Well, I know I have my work cut out for me because my 18-month-old daughter was…you know. My wife has a stray pack of tarot cards we almost threw out and she was like, no, just let the kid play with them. And she was walking around with the fool going “dada, dada.” I was like, I'm so screwed. You know, by the time she’s 13, 14!Last, this is a bonus round question. But our communications manager, Jenna Marshall really wanted to know from you why it is that you think complexity science triggers some people's bullshit detectors.There are people that have gone kind of out of their way to talk about how, “There's no there there.” That it's a pseudoscience. And a lot of people seem to have picked up on that. I think a lot of it seems to be just because of the reputation that acquired in the nineties but you know, like what is it? I mean, the fact that it's polysemantic, the fact that it's still this sort of open area of research? What is it do you think is triggering people's skepticism when it comes to complex systems science generally?CARL BERGSTROM: That's a really good question. I don't have a very snap answer. I think that we'd have to look and see whether at any time in our history as a discipline, we have been prone to producing a lot of bullshit. So, it may be that just people are reasonably good Bayesians but that said it does seem to trigger people. I mean, it does seem to trigger bullshit detectors and it may be one of these things where people just have…you're further removed from immediate ability to test hypotheses because of the inherent complexities that you're looking at. You're trying to understand emergent phenomenon and it may be more difficult to apply the mental schema that we have to understand notions of cause and effect. And it may be more difficult to generate compelling evidence of the same sort … I'm bull***ting. Dammit!MICHAEL GARFIELD: Well, I guess we can wrap it there or you know, “wipe,” I guess or something. Thank you so much for joining us folks. I can't imagine you not having enjoyed this. Please follow Carl and Jevin on Twitter and let them hold your hand and reveal to you the insane amount of manure that we're having to wade through on a daily basis. They're both doing great work with this. You can find their Twitter handles in our show notes, as well as all of the papers that we've discussed and their link to their new book and their online course, which is freely available. Thank you so much. Anything else you want to add before we call it?CARL BERGSTROM: No, that was fantastic conversation. I mean it really could have gone in a million directions at every point. Like you promised at the start that you were going to do something a bit different than the usual talking points interview. And my goodness you've certainly delivered. So, this is why I love SFI. It's like every time I come out…conversations like this.MICHAEL GARFIELD: Thanks, and good luck fighting the good fight.CARL BERGSTROM: Thanks a lot, Michael.
42,Episode Details / Transcript (Time code starts after the introduction. Transcript edited by Rayyan Zahid.) Michael Garfield (0s): Vicky, Henrik. It's a pleasure to have you on Complexity Podcast. Vicky Yang (5s): Thank you so much, Michael. Michael Garfield (7s): I would love to have a kind of roots, trunk and branches type of structure for this conversation. Starting with your backstories as researchers, like how you got into doing the kind of work that you're doing at SFI and what motivates and inspires you to take on this kind of research. Vicky Yang (29s): How far back are we going? Michael Garfield (33s): Wherever you feel like the story starts for you. Vicky Yang (37s): Okay, I'll go first. I have a shorter story to tell than Henrik, probably being around for less. I grew up in Wuhan, China. I was born there, sadly, my hometown will always be known for COVID-19 while it does have many other good things. I came to the States when I was 19 years old to go to college. I started with studying physics and applied mathematics because I liked the clarity and the rigor of the quantitative methods and knowing things for sure.At the same time, I also volunteered in a social psychology lab, and I was running human experiments to study implicit biases about gender and people with foreign accents. I was fascinated by that line of work because I feel like there are ways we can talk precisely about human biases and things close to your everyday life. Later in grad school, it occurred to me that these two lines of interests merge.I started looking at human behavior through mathematical modeling and the data driven way. I was applying the methods that I was in love with to solve the problems that I was passionate about. So that continues till today. Henrik Olsson (2 m 6s): Okay. It's my turn. I grew up in Sweden and all the parts of Sweden were close to the Arctic circle. Very dark in the winter, very, very light in the summer. I actually didn't know what to do after I finished high school. And then all of a sudden I found myself applying for Uppsala university. I went to Uppsala university and there I got interested in political science.I started to think about applying to the doctoral program, political science, after I finished my undergraduate thesis. The thing was that I also had an interest in psychology and also did undergrad studies in psychology. I have a double major in political science and psychology. And the thing is that the doctoral program then was too difficult to get into as compared to political science. That's your psychology, that's the way it is. And then I started to become interested in how people make decisions, in political science and psychology, because I've been part of a strong movement in both psychology and political science, economics about using a kind of rational actor model to try to understand people that way.That would become my background in the rational choice tradition and game theory that started my interest in decision-making. When I started my graduate studies in psychology, I sort of became interested in human judgment, human decision-making more broadly, and also specifically how people make judgments about subjective probabilities attached to future events and actions and so on. That led my interest in computation modeling.In the early days, judgment and decision-making was not so much on cognitive plausible models. It was mostly based on simple verbal theories, important from economics and so on. We try to apply like a more collective psychology or cognitive science perspective to judgment and decision-making. That started my interest in computational modeling.After that I got the opportunity to start as a researcher/scientist at a Max Planck Institute in Berlin, Max Planck Institute of human development. And there, I really got into the importance of interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary research, which is of course a hallmark of SFI. We had a team of biologists, economists, psychologists that worked on questions and started to solve them together. Not trenched into different disciplinary boundaries, but actually working together on trying to understand decision making.All of a sudden, a former self, or actually my wife had found herself getting offered a job at SFI. And back in 1993 when I started my doctoral studies, I read this book about SFI and I said, at one point in time, I will come there and I will do research at SFI. That dream came true. Five years ago, we moved there and came to SFI. It broadened the horizons even more because before I haven't been so much into contact with physicists and mathematicians to learn about all those tools that have been developed and used by the system mathematicians, especially when it came to belief dynamics.So that started the interest in beliefs and how beliefs can change or not change. What makes people change their beliefs and what makes belief more resistance to change? We have now started several projects where we try to investigate the mechanism behind that and try to mold it based on insights from a wide range of disciplines. Michael Garfield (6m 16s): Excellent. So just to call the shot before I take it, I would like to weave back and forth between work that you've done with other researchers, each of you, and then work that you've done together. And I would like to start with Vicky, your work that you advised on for a paper with Louisa Lee and Siyu Zhang on whether two parties represent the United States, then I'd like to proceed to the manuscript that the two of you are working on right now with Tamara van der Does about falling through the cracks, modeling the formation of social category boundaries, as a way of understanding the results of that first study.And then Vicky to talk about work that you've done with Daniel M Abrams, Georgia Kernell, and Adilson E Motter recently on why it is that US political parties are as polarized as they are. And then Henrik to turn to a paper that you wrote on harvesting the wisdom of crowds for election predictions using the Bayesian truth serum with Wandi Bruine de Bruin Mirta Galesic and Drazen Prelec. But yeah, so I think that the structure here is the lay of the land, what does the American political system really look like quantitatively when we analyze it?And then why do we see a difference between the position of us political parties and people's actual political positions, and then how we relate to one another and how that bounds up in identity and as you were saying, the sort of cognitive dimensions of this. And then how we can start to understand what the political results of this deepening polarization are likely to be like how we study these changes in the future of the elections and so on in this country.So just to start, yeah, Vicky, I'd love to talk about this paper that you advised on. Do the two parties actually represent the United States. And I would just love to hear you talk a little bit about the way that this study analyzed the data and the results that it came to. Vicky Yang (8m 32s): Yeah. This project started as a summer undergraduate research project. The two authors on the paper were undergraduate students at Northwestern and Louisa who led this paper just finished her freshman year. She is an incredible, impressive person who did all the heavy lifting in this study. In this study, we took a national opinion survey that surveys the people on concrete issues over policy, for example, should we have government health insurance or private ones?And there are about a dozen of these issues. And we had to do the survey over time for, I believe back to the seventies or eighties. This paper is using machine learning technique of supervised clustering that says using the public opinion data that, if I ask a computer to characterize it by two clusters, where are the clusters? Using this method, we find what’s the best description of the data that we have in the political landscape and what is best described with a big centrist cluster and a small right-wing cluster.We also asked a question where additional parties were representing a system. We looked if introducing additional clusters would allow models to have more clusters to describe the data, and we use a model selection method that asks how well this describes the data while penalizing for the additional parameter that we introduced. And we find a yes! Indeed, including additional parties will help us represent the data better.The current two class two description isn't the best and the precise number of best parties I think is arguable because the variation in how well it matches the data. The benefit of introducing a new class eventually starts to decay. But we know two isn't the best. We guess it is somewhere like between three and six, but we don't have a precise answer at the moment. And because we picked, these dozen issues may have different weights between them, which we haven't been able to figure out.We are at a ballpark of where the estimate is. Michael Garfield (11m 8s): I think that's pretty well established, at least in the court of public opinion that we don't have enough political parties in the United States. So this brings me to the latest work that I have from the two of you with Tamara on how social category boundaries are formed in the first place and how it is that, one of the more disturbing things that your model formalizes in this paper that is like very, very clear, I think on the ground is that, anytime you have a position that's sort of in between two poles of a duality, whether or not that duality is a fair representation of what's actually going, on each side will regard the people in between zone as the other.Why is this, why are so many people falling through the cracks, not just in terms of political parties, but in terms of, you know, other axes of identity, like gender or race, why is it that at the individual level and at the social level, these kinds of unfair otherings are going on. Vicky Yang (12m 20s): I'll take a stab at this and then let Henrik fill in. So social categorization is the process by which we want to motto “where do people draw the boundary between us and them?”. People fall on a continuum. They're not discrete boxes like Democrats and Republicans, but they have a continuous distribution from liberal to conservative policy positions. But out of this continuum, somehow boundaries are drawn where groups are formed and people into groups think oh these people are us and these are them.And we wonder, the question we’re wanting to answer is where and how do boundaries form? The way we have approached this question is we first started with a model that describes the combination of two processes. For each individual they're influenced by two things. One is to tell people a part accurately, that is they want to put people far away from them in the “them” bracket and put some of them in the “us” bracket.And then the second thing they're influenced by is they want to agree with other people in their group where the boundary is. They don't want the group to have very different opinions. It's a combination of cognitive and social processes. And if we allow each group to draw their own boundary, we find that these two processes lead to the results such that the boundary is more exclusive than in the middle of the spectrum. It's the combination of both things that leads to this asymmetry.And then from that, we see that the middle becomes then seeing from both sides. Henrik Olsson (14m 4s): The psychological background to this is that in many ways there's a lot of research in psychology about categorization. There's lots of different models, mathematical models that try to understand individual categorization of objects. Is this dangerous or not? Is this a cup, or is it a glass, stuff like? But when it comes to social domains, these formal models are not so prevalent, and they're not many models that try to integrate both this kind of internal code to process that we have and the social influence from other people.And what we're doing here is try to do exactly that and which we're also doing in my other research. We're trying to integrate the individual decision-making processes; I believe updating processes with the social influence and the influence that your immediate or the larger social network has on you. I think that is one main contribution. In order to understand social categorization, we need to really look at both the individual and the social processes this goes on. Michael Garfield (15m 16s): Yeah. One of the things that I think will feel kind of intuitively true, that you are able to validate with this model is that Democrats and Republicans both sort of perceive independent voters with mistrust. And that this feels to me like, again, this is not merely a political issue, that this is something that we see going back, you mentioned in this, in this paper, for example, people of mixed race, you know, or I think this is also true of people, of mixed cultural standings, people who are non-binary and gender. Vicky Yang (15m 55s): Let me give you more information on the kind of data analysis we also did with a paper that also showed this behavior in the observations. We took political survey data, and we asked “how do Democrats and Republicans”, which are measured by their party registration of date they report, “how did people of these two groups see three different groups of people, members of their own party members of the other party and the political independents?”.The data we're able to get was to question political independents. They only asked 80 and 84 and after 84, they threw that question out, which I'll come back to later. In that data, we find that Democrats see themselves very favorably, Republicans less favorably, that's predictable. And then the question is, how do they see political independents? If I didn't see that model, I wouldn't easily guess maybe they're in the middle of Democrats and Republicans.However, in the data we find independents seen as sort of the same in terms of positivity with Republicans. And then the same thing happens with the other party. For Democrats or Republicans, independents are seen as unfavorably as members of the outer party, which means if you are independent, you got the worst of both worlds. That you don't feel you belong to either group. And you're not even in the middle of between my party and their party.You're sort of considered as theirs on both sides. And then when I saw the results, this data is political attitudes, and I also learned by searching for these kinds of data, I realize there are so fewer people who actually learned about political independents compared to what they know about people on the two extremes. There is a very little data gathering about how independents are perceived and a more detailed picture of what goes on in their lives is needed.And the second thing I'll say is that when I saw this result, I kind of can relate anecdotally to many of these things. For example, I grew up in China, but I lived in the US for a long time. In the US I'm considered Chinese. When I go back to China, many people tell me that I'm too Americanized. I'm sort of neither in a way. You mentioned, the study of, of multiracial people. One anecdotal example is Obama about how in the beginning of his political career he struggled between people who thought he was too black.And people who thought he was not black enough. And that kind of behavior was also replicated in a number of experiments where they asked participants how they perceive an individual of mixed race, and why people think they're not white and black people think they're not black. They fall through the cracks. We think it is possible that this model can be extended to other attributes. And it will be great if we can gather more data on that. Henrik and I, with Tamra, we're working on experiments.One is we hope to get a more recent picture of how political independence is perceived currently, which we don't get from this national survey anymore. And then we also hope to see if we can extend it to other attributes. Michael Garfield (19m 38s): Yeah. Even in Santa Fe, I don't know how widely true this is in the United States, but even in Santa Fe, if you're registered as an independent, you're not allowed to vote at the local level. You know? There's lots of ways that this damage, like, again, you're talking about in that last paper, that enormous third cluster that just gets sort of punted back and forth. Vicky Yang (20m 1s): Yeah. What I'd like to highlight here is there's a distinction between a group identity or identification with a party versus what you believe in terms of liberal versus conservative beliefs. These are two different things, but recently they're increasingly mixed up to feel like one thing, especially when we talk here in debates in the media about politics, but really party identification or group identification in general sits on top of this continuum of liberal conservative belief.So how does group identification arise from this distribution is a non-trivial question, while we often think is one thing and where the boundaries are drawn are also affected by other forces of social and cognitive influences. It's not necessarily we're presenting the underlying distribution of what people believe on concrete issues. Michael Garfield (21m 4s): Yeah. You know, you mentioned in this paper, one speculative example that you offer in terms of how people fall through the cracks is that the disconnect between issue polarization and social polarization and previous empirical research has found that identification with political parties and antipathy toward the opposing party increased disproportionately compared to opinion on issues. So it's like we're, you know, to sort of toss a line out to later in this conversation, Henrik, when we're talking about how do you pull people, how do you gather information, you know, in a way that accurately represents the landscape of opinion, there's this, this question of, I think both of you are familiar with the evidence that issues polling makes Americans look a whole lot more in agreement than asking the question of who are you going to vote for?And that brings us to this piece on satisficing, right? And, and the polarization of American political parties that there's something going on here. Even if you assume, as you do in this, in this paper, Vicki, that the public itself does not change in their opinions over time, where they stand on the issues that the parties can still become more and more polarized. And this is set aside from issues like the ones we discussed with Carl Bergstrom and Jevon West on the show earlier about disinformation campaigns and search filter bubbles, and the influence of the media generally on the polarization of public opinion, that there's something else going on here.Could you speak to that? Vicky Yang (22m 37s): Yeah. I will first try to clarify a few different definitions of polarization that people tend to confuse and make this discussion really confusing. When people talk about the parties polarizing, they often refer to members of Congress or, or political leaders. And you can measure polarization in multiple ways, but for political parties, in multiple ways that we can measure polarization, it shows they have been polarized.For example, people have looked at the co-voting network in Congress, how often congressional members are voting on the same side of the bill. And we find that congressional members of different parties are voting less and less across party lines. So that is one measure of polarization. People have also measured that in other terms. Some people can, they're just a quantitative method through which you kind of assign an ideological position, so we put every congressional member on a line based on how they voted in the past. And you kind of see how much this distribution is spreading out.And that indeed also is occurring. However, we ask, is this polarized Congress, an outcome of a polarized public? That question becomes more complicated because there are two popular measures of polarization for the public, and they show different results. The first is sorting that is asking how much do you people's party identification corresponds to their liberal conservative sort of ideology to spectrum.It used to be, you can have a liberal Republican and the conservative Democrats, so people can be on the left side of the space, but identify with the Republican Party that is happening increasingly less. If we measure polarization by sorting, yes, it's happening. They are also many scholars that argue sorting is happening to a lesser extent in the public that in the Congress. Also an outcome of sorting is that if you take out people who already identify as Democrat and Republicans, and you try how people who identify with these two parties change over time, you'll see the center of the two parts drifting apart in the public.So that is the outcome of sorting. However, it gets more complicated when you look at the second measure of polarization, which is called dispersion. That is if I'm blind about who identifies with what party, I just look at everybody in the country and look at how they're distributed in this liberal to conservative space. And there is very little signal about systematic changes over time. It's really not clear if this distribution changes at all.There was data that showed a fluctuation, but no systematic trend. The most likely picture of what's going on in the public is that the people have somewhat a one humped distribution with more people in the middle. However, the way people associate political parties with their liberal comes over that positions has been changing. Michael Garfield (25m 56s): I wonder in thinking back to episode nine with, to, and talking about how people project a local information bias based on their their personal networks and then onto the global situation. I wonder how much of the difference in the distribution between the American public at large and Congress has to do with the fact that in Congress, you're sitting in the same room with people that, you know, or have a different opinion and sort of like, you know, calling back to this paper on, you know, the in between category that like, there's something about people having to define themselves against someone else sitting across the hall from you that is driving this phenomenon.And in Congress, just noting that we haven't actually gotten the satisficing model yet, but I'd love to speculate and see what y'all think is going on there. Why is there this difference at that level or between those two levels? Vicky Yang (26m 52s): Yeah. Does a satisfying model propose one way this kind of thing can happen, The way you said, like, if politicians are motivated to distinguish themselves from those over on the other party sounds very plausible too. I haven't studied that mechanism in itself. Somebody else probably has. I'll just give a brief summary of what the satisficing model is doing. Sort of the backstory of that.There was a classic model called the down ??Zia model for parties. And it gives a very paradoxical result if everybody votes and if everybody votes for the party closest to them, and if the parties want to get the most votes, each party wants to be in the middle of the spectrum. That is not what's happening currently in politics. And one question is why would that happen? And also, what can explain this disconnect between the voters and the party. It seems like the voters themselves, if we take out their party label, they haven't changed very much.And how can you have voters with mostly, somewhat moderate policy positions and you get parties that are totally not representative of them. The model assumes the satisficing behavior. Okay, let me back up one second. In most mathematical models that study voting on, they assume people have some objective function they want to maximize. They pick the party that maximizes the objective. However, in psychology, there's a lot of evidence for a satisficing behavior that is when people are faced with a complex situation, they don't optimize.However, they settle for what is good enough. The biggest novelty of this model is that it gives a quantitative translation of this bounded irrational behavior. We are able to put that into mathematical forms, and then we latch the parties, optimizing their position in response to satisficing voters. In this model most parameters we actually predict the parties will want to stabilize at some finite separation.They won't want to collide together. Like the ??Downsville model said the intuition about where they stabilize is entirely can be explained as two things. One is so basically when you, when people do satisficing, if you're too far from them, the voter may feel not represented at all by either party. And they just don't turn out to vote at all. If you are too much on the tail, you lose the people in the middle.However, you go to the middle you, one loses the people on the tail, two you need to compete with the other party for the middle of voters. There is a balance between where you are, and then the distance between the parties is determined by one parameter. That is sort of how much ideological purity there is in the party. Whether your party is appealing broadly or appealing narrowly.And the way we measure that parameter by the ideological spread of the congressional members of that party. We took that method that put every congressional member on the line, and we looked at how wisely they're being spread out. We infer the parameter from data that way. And we know, both the model and the data say that if you have narrower parties, then the parties would want to be placed further apart to win more votes.So that the winning strategy becomes a more polarized political landscape If ideological purity is increasing. Michael Garfield (30m 53s): So to Henrik, I'm thinking about the conversation I had with Rajiv Sethi very early on like episode seven of this show, when he was talking about stereotypes and how we lean on stereotypes more when our decision-making is under some kind of spatiotemporal pressure, you know, the dark alley in which you're meeting someone and you have to make a snap decision and we lean on, you know, our conditioning and heuristics rather than getting to sit down.And this is like a classic anecdotally in terms of, "Oh, I'm not a racist. I have one black friend", you know, like I know this one person, you know, I have dinner with them, and they're great, but the rest of this out-group is not. And I'm curious what your thoughts are in terms of what Vicky was just saying, you know, as the decision becomes more complex, people tend to break down. And I think this would be a good spot actually, just to dig in a little bit more about the details of what you're talking about in this area.When, when we're talking about bounded rationality, what is bounding this rationality, because this is a big thing also with the work that SFI does and economics, and like the way that we model economic systems. I don't know if you care to be our tour guide down this particular lazy river, but I think, you know, laying out some basic stuff about bounded rationality, and then how it's determining sort of where people start leaning on cognitive props in these kinds of decisions would be really interesting. Henrik Olsson (32m 28s): I want to push back a little bit about this bounded rationality, because I think the general kind of view of or in many senses when people hear about the rationality that they think about something less than rational. I don't think that it's true because we talk about optimality. We talked about optimizing, but in real life, we cannot optimize. There is no objective function that can be optimized.There is no way we can, we can ever come to the normative correct in many situations. We take actions, we make decisions, and we do not know what the future will bring. We do not know that when we make the decision, but we can define other aspects of UN other norms, other rationale norms. For example, how well do different decisions, strategies work in different environments, try to figure out when is it good to use satisficing. When there is a good reason to use decision-making.Sometimes they work. Sometimes they don't work. And the thing is to try to understand when they work and when they do not work. And in many situations, there is no way we can calculate what the maximizing decision would be because there is no way we can know it. There is a, there is a non-quantifiable uncertainty there, even though we would like to have quantifiable as are there, but we cannot do it. that's one thing.When I was at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin, one of the main foundations there was bounded rationality by Herbert Simon's ideas. But the specific interpretation of Herbert Simon's ideas is that it's not less rational. If it says good or even better, it can be a better guide to rational decision-making in real life than actually maximizing decision-making. I also want to add one thing with polarization and, beliefs and, actions and decisions.I think also there is this distinction. We need to think about those beliefs and actions. And of course it could be that you can have a belief, an ingrained belief, but in strategic circumstances at the point of when you are making a decision in parliament, you must take an action, you must make a decision and you must vote for something because your party colleagues must see you in a certain way, because you haven't actually changed your belief. This has a strategic thing that you do in that circumstance.And it can also be the same here. I am a Republican for my whole life, but I don't like Trump, so I will vote for Biden. But as soon as there is a reasonable Republican again, I'm going to vote Republican again. We have this kind of thing that you have the beliefs and you have the action decisions which need to be both whole. You need to consider both at the time because of different measures. If you ask people about beliefs, you can get one, and if you see their actions and voting behavior then they can look totally incompatible.But you need to look down to the circumstances of the specific action of voting and the circumstances that took place and why that person might've been voted that way. Michael Garfield (36m 1s): Yeah, that reminds me when I was talking with David Krakauer for the transmission series about David Kinney's article for that series where he was talking about how scientists want to offer to policymakers, the spectrum. You know, that it is like, this is how much uncertainty we have about the situation. This is the rigorous way of talking about it. But a spectrum of possibilities is less useful when you're making a policy decision. Then this is the most likely outcome.And there's this sort of philosophical problem of how scientific advice even happens. I mean and like you said, this is true, not just in the advising policymakers, this is true in selecting them that, you know, the contextuality of these decisions, you know, forces a decision in certain ways. That seems, I think, you know, to call back to the beginning of this conversation very much like what's going on socially in terms of the excluded middle in these, at the group level, which is a seemingly inescapable tragedy in some respects that maybe, like you said earlier, Vicky, that what we're looking at is we just need better models.I know that to instantiate them in society, you know, like I know a lot of people that are pushing for rank choice voting as like one way of getting around this kind of problem. But that brings us Henrik to the last piece I wanted to talk about with the two of you, which is the piece you led authored on harvesting the wisdom of crowds for election predictions using the Bayesian Truth Serum. And I think for those who didn't hear your conversation with Mirta, I think it makes sense to give a little bit of background on this paper, you know, to talk about how different kinds of polling happens and sort of the relative strengths of different kinds of election predictions, polling, and how that reveals through those different methods, the ways that people are taking into consideration, all of these different contextual restraints, you know, it shows how people are making these decisions. Henrik Olsson (38m 10s): The last few years, it has actually been an ongoing conversation or discussion about polling is that it's got a lot of problems with it. And the last few years you've seen the response frequency of different surveys that contacts people are low. Less than 10% is going to answer your survey and what type of results can we get from 10% when you try to sample some part of people?It is going to be a very biased sample. There has been lots of discussion. And also in the last few years, there has been some rather mis-prediction in terms of elections in Brexit and so on. And also, the discussion about the last presidential election about how polling actually didn't work well. On a national level, it worked well, but in important States in the US the polling didn't work at all.So traditionally polling questions ask about intentions. Who are you going to vote for? That's the traditional way of doing it, but we can also try to leverage the wisdom of crowds of people and who they think are going to win the election. This type of question has actually been asked for a long time. They started so far back as the 1930s in different surveys, but haven't been widely adopted by the polling industry and all this aggregated result, all the polls you see now, are mostly based on onboarding intention.Sometimes they report these election expectation questions, but mostly as a curiosity not as that real prediction. But the thing is that this winner's expectation questions, they are shown to actually predict election outcomes very well, but they're not foolproof. And one thing that is usually leveraged against the question is that there is a risk that you have a bias that you project on your own onboarding intention.You get the bias that way. A few years ago, we started to think about how your immediate social environment kind of affects you and how you can use information you have about your immediate social environment to make predictions about different characteristics in the population. That led to a theory that I'm not going to talk about here, and that led us to developing questions that ask not about who you're going to win the election, but you ask who do you think your friends are going to vote for?That's an interesting question, because the idea is that you can reach people that might not answer the poll question, the survey questions. You basically enhance the sample. You reach one person, but you get the sample to become larger and you can reach other people that you may not be able to reach. We try these questions now in several elections and show that they outperform consistently the voting intentions, and they all can also help you perform reputation questions.So that's the background to the work we're doing now together with researchers from MIT and University of Southern California, where now have a project where we try to use this different question together with other more sophisticated ways of integrating information from these different sources of over information, present with these questions, to be able to make these predictions more accurate.But in addition to that, we also try to understand what type of factors are behind problems with polling. There's lots of talk about the shy voter effect, for example. I don't want to admit to who I am going to vote for if there is some shameful candidate. But if someone asks me, I may say, I don't want to do that. But if I was asked about how others will vote.Your social circle might be less, less susceptible to these kinds of biases or reluctance to answer questions. But then on the other hand, there have been arguments that this winner's expectation questions can have a large bias in them. It can also affect the social circle question. For example, there's talk about, especially now in the election here, but also in other elections that it could be that some of the candidates or the government in the country will do something before the election that will change the outcome.They think something like the Magical Trump effect, for example. He will lose, so he will change something. He will propose something that makes the landscape change totally, and he will win. And then these kinds of expectations can then creep into these winner expectation questions, which might bias them because it might not happen, which might make them less reliable in, for example, in this election, in the US and there's been arguments in the media about that.We try to understand now, try to ask other survey questions. We are asking a big national representative sample of respondents of up to 5,000 people around the US about these three different questions on voting questions, winner and reputation questions, and what we call social circle questions. When you ask them about how you think your immediate social environment will work. But in addition to that, you also try to understand there that if people think that something's going to happen just before the election, that was changed to assault somehow, or how much discomfort they feel by divulging this information.About who they would vote for and how much discomfort do they feel when they are asked about their friends and family, or they are going to vote. We try to understand what can affect these different polling questions. And then in addition to that, we have done more or less explicitly in the beginning, more or less work with sophisticated ways of aggregating this information. And we are actually now working on other ways to integrate information, all these three questions.we're actually now writing a new version of this paper that you mentioned that have a new and exciting way or doing this, but it's not prime time yet, but we're working on it Michael Garfield (45m 31s): While we're awaiting the new paper. I would love to dig in a little bit, because I just think that this is, this is like a cool technique here. You know, one of your co-authors on this Drazen Prelec has written extensively about this, this technique, the Bayesian Truth Serum and how you help ensure that you're getting honest answers in polling when you don't have a way of independently verifying that the person is giving you an honest answer. I'd love to hear you provide an exegesis of this for listeners, if you will, how does this actually work in your study?And then in what situations do it seem to improve the quality of the polling or where does it seem like it's not helping? Henrik Olsson (46m 15s): The thing is, I mean, this Bayesian Truth Serum, as you said, that it's developed by and developed in the mid 2000 semester, I saw this article about that. As we use this in several areas, it's basically a scoring method, as I said for incentivizing truthfulness, in the sense of honest, informal, careful answers to any type of number of viable questions.So basically, in a very simple way is that it uses the election winner expectations. You either use the question that you asked, the own intention question or the social circle question. The survey used the own intention question, but we are also using the winner expectation question and, basically overweight participants who provide more informed, more careful own intention questions. So that is basically what it's doing, and that is a technical thing about it that can be shown that it's Bayesian updating and so forth.But what the battles are always participants who provide more informed careful own intention, and it uses its own intention question to do that in a clever way. And we see that it actually works, not in certain circumstances. For example, if we use the winner election expectations to overweight social circle expectations questions, then we see that it almost always improves over and above the social circle question.We get an improvement. We get our own intention that predicts something, and then we have a winner's expectation, maybe a little bit better, but even better than that is the social circle question. But we can even above that, we can improve the social circle by applying the Bayesian Truths Serum. Michael Garfield (48m 21s): But you mentioned in this paper that it doesn't really improve predictions for the margins of the winner. Henrik Olsson (49m 0s): So that's something we try to figure out what it is, but the margin in the US is also particular for a two-party system that they use the margins in this way. And if you have a many party system and look at how it predicts overall all different parties in other countries, it would be a different view of it, but we're still trying to figure out exactly what is going on with margin predictions. Michael Garfield (49m 0s): So maybe it's just my privilege of being this close to this kind of research that makes me feel like a lot of these discoveries are formalizing intuitions about how politics works in this country. What do you feel has surprised you about the findings that we've discussed today or, you know what it reveals about the way that people make decisions or what it might suggest about the future political landscape of the United States? Vicky Yang (49m 34s): Okay, I'll go first. I guess one thing that I've learned that felt surprising that I wouldn't have known before I started doing this, is we always talk about how the US is a divided country, how we're so polarized. And it makes it feel as if people who belong to these two groups are just very different people who really dislike the other side. However, there's a distinction between which group you identify with versus what you actually think about concrete things.And I feel the group identity is making us feel that we are more different than we actually are when we really boil down to what we think on actual stuff. And the analogy I like to draw is with sports. You can have Yankees fans and the Red Sox fan, for example. There are two groups, and they have a strong identity of the group, and they don't think about members of the other group.However, if you really look at the people and how they think about the sports, they may not be that different. There's like this sort of fandom I suspect in what we're seeing. What we're seeing in the group conflict is very real, but it doesn't mean people of the two groups are at the core of different people. Michael Garfield (51m 5s): Yeah. That seems like an important takeaway while things are in some sort of social centrifuge right now, kind of, a bomb on a wounded country in that respect. Henrik, what about you? Henrik Olsson (51m 17s): Oh, that's a good question. I think so, so I started out doing research on individual decision-making. Individuals who sit in the lab make decisions, but the last few years I've come to realize that is the most important thing that we have. And it's also been informed by all the social structure, the social environment, and how important the social environment is. And that we need to put even more effort to understand the influence of the larger social environment on your belief in individual decision-making.And also, how well actually people know the social environment. And I think we come to realize that we cannot talk about individuals as an isolated Island by themselves and need to talk about their network. And of course, that's what we talk about all the time at SFI. We need to see things in their perspective and their network connections. And I think that is the way we need to go forward with, especially in psychology, which has not been so much interested in the actual social connections between people and investigating the actual reality of your social environment.We have an interest in reading the nets of other people, Tom is this and that, Louise is like this and that and then you have some reaction to that. We haven't actually investigated the real social environment with people. And I think that's the major insight. And also, that in order to understand it, we need to even more focus on your immediate social environment and the impact you have on individuals. Michael Garfield (53m 3s): Yeah. You know, to that point, just looking over the USC Dornsife election website, which we'll link to in the show notes, I love that there's, you can break down all the different polling graphs that you know you're taking and how the further you get from the independent party affiliation being, I guess, in the middle, you get the strong Republicans are saying, Trump's going to win by a lot. The lean Republicans are predicting less and the same is going on in the opposite way on the democratic side, but then you've got it right in the middle.You've got that band of independence or no affiliation where the margin that they're predicting is so small, it's within the gray area of like the demilitarized zone of no statistically significant results. I don't know if you agree, but that seems to speak to what you were just saying. That it's sort of a, there is again to, you know, to cast back all the way to the first paper we discussed here, that there's a sort of like optical illusion in which it's like hard to see into, and maybe even like out of the middle in these situations. Henrik Olsson (54m 8s): Yeah. And they're also on the website that we'll see this kind of quite big discrepancy between the different predictions from these different questions. If I look at my own intention, it looks like Biden has quite a comfortable lead, but then if you look at reputations, then that goes to a very basic known significant difference between the candidates. And then we have the social circle question we've done. So a little bit bigger leap, but still come on narrow lead for item that can have many, that could be the truth, but it can also be a reflection of what we talked about earlier about that people are going to expect something's going to happen before the election that happened 2016, everyone was surprised it's going to have to begin.This winner's reputation question may be underestimating the Biden lead, but we think that the social circle question is less susceptible to that. If I will bet my money on something, I would bet on this then it is the social circle question, given that. Michael Garfield (55m 8s): So just because we've reached the top of the tree, and we're touching the sky here, I'd like to end with a more speculative question for the two of you, which is, as you mentioned in Vicky and Henrik in this piece, falling through the cracks. That again, the boundaries of where we delineate our social groups have changed over time. I mean, if you look at, you know, LGBTQI, that whole thing has exploded over the last few years, you know, like the census is including so many different racial answers than it used to.And I'm curious, you know, to me, this looks sort of like if I zoom way out, it looks like the tree of life following some sort of maximal entropy production algorithm, you know where it's like, you know, evolution is sort of through the you know, different adapted anatomy is trying to solve the puzzle of how to model its own facts. You know, that it's like the biosphere it's, you know, modeling itself the way that we model the economy from within it.And so something like this is like, what do you imagine based on your work for the future of the American political system, do you think that we're going to continue to have a two party system, or do you think, do you think that we have a realistic bid at going more of the way of like the Australian parliament where, you know, there are like three major parties in seven minor parties. Do you think that we're going to order like call to Stephanie Crabtree's work or the essay that she wrote for the transmission series about the decline of Chacoan culture and how certain things in more sort of stable times are able to kind of homogenize and conglomerate because of economies of scale, but then if you disturb those systems, then they break apart?And I'm, you know, I'm wondering, you know whether what we're seeing right now is actually sort of the foreshadowing of a fragmentation of American political parties as a way of addressing some of the problems that we're seeing right now. And what are your thoughts on all of that? Vicky Yang (57m 19s): Can I give you a somewhat rambling answer? Michael Garfield (57m 22s): Yeah. I think that was the rambling question. Vicky Yang (57m 25s): Okay. I'll give you two answers to like two aspects of a question. One, are we likely to see a multi-time party system? Unfortunately, I'm not optimistic because, with the role of election, as it is the plurality winner take all election is known to favor two big parties. While in most of Europe, they have proportional representation. You win 5% of the vote. You got 5% of the seats. The system means in the way it's set up is helping the two-party landscape persist.And then on the local level, there are also a number of bills recently introduced that make third parties or, or independent candidates make their lives harder. Like you have to gather tens of thousands of signatures or, or things like that. I think it will be really helpful if we have more parties, but I'm not very optimistic that this will happen. I think the rank choice voting will be really helpful if that can be implemented on a bigger scale. I know there are many state and local elections using that.And I think that will really help the representation problem. And then I'm going to give a rambling answer to a second question about what we see in the political future. Like currently one reason why like this, this world seems such a mess is because you have very strong group identities. And there's a very strong idea of like, they're like immigrants are seen as the personal representation or the scapegoats of many problems on the scene.It goes back to reading reasonably read about like a social theory, which is still hypothesis is not confirmed. The other big thinking along the slide. It's about how, where does this kind of thing come from? And it's this strong group mentality, populism, and this basic want to be separated from, from other parts of the world. There's a hypothesis that this is a response to the increased globalization and urbanization.We've seen over the years that there the world is increasingly connected. And then that's why we not only see Brexit, but we also see, you know, cause for Scottish independence and then Catalan. So that is really groups trying to draw a line between themselves and the interconnected world to preserve their identity. And some people also argue, there are also groups of people who are left not as better off as the people who really benefited from the increased globalization.And when these people are unhappy and then you have a political candidate coming and saying, you are unhappy not because of this big systematic problem, nobody knows how to solve it. You are unhappy because of these people. And they give a face to the reason for your problem. And that becomes a very compelling narrative. I feel like addressing what we're seeing is a very big systematic question about this whole economic trajectory we've been on since the industrial revolution.That's my wild speculation. I don't know exactly how to approach it and think that's something I'm thinking about right now, but I wish I have an answer. I don't, but I would love people to discuss more on that line. Michael Garfield (1h 1m 6s): Yeah. Henrik, what about you? What are your thoughts on all of this? Henrik Olsson (1h 1m 10s): Yeah, the first question about the multi-party...I think, as we get across the election system in the U.S. that is basically guaranteed to produce something like a two-party system. And also, in terms of the history and the context of the constitution, the amendments, all of that together, the history, it's very unlikely to change.I mean, that's not going to happen for many, many years. Because there's so many things that need to change for that to change. You said about the connectedness, I think we feel this is a messy situation, but it could be that we feel it's messier because we get more information.We may know more, I mean, in early times we had less information about what our leaders, our elected leaders, or other assistants in the country did. Now we get updates every second about everything. We get the information about their things. Everything looks messier. it's good to just be that it was equally messy, 50 years ago, 100 years ago, but we just didn't know it. And we got less information here.We get so much information in every second that it just looks messy. It might be that under other administrations, some other times it was just as messy, but we just didn't know it. Michael Garfield (1h 3m 15s): Right when I spoke to Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West said something similar last week when. Carl was saying he thinks that largely the accelerating news cycle is a manufactured phenomenon and that it doesn't actually impress upon us the need to make decisions at that much faster than we did before you know, web 2.0. Good information from two days ago is more valuable than unreliable information today.And it sounds like, you know, he was kind of advising that we slow down. We exert patience. That we think that the more we allow the latencies inherent in our collective sense making and decision-making processes, we give them time for these things to percolate through the system, rather than try to zoom in and look at the coastline of Britain with our inch stick, or our centimeter ruler, you know that.So certainly, you see a lot of fluctuation in the polling and when you're polling people as frequently as you are in the USC life study, I don't know. That's probably just cut that all out. Cause everything you just said was great. It's all super interesting stuff. I'm really glad that I got to talk to the two of you today. Do you have any final thoughts before we leave people, anything you want to sort of leave lingering in people’s minds when they sign out here? Henrik Olsson (1h 5m 9s): Vote in November. Vicky Yang (1h 5m 16s): I can tell people that Wuhan besides having COVID also has really good breakfast noodles, great lakes and cherry blossoms. Henrik Olsson (1h 5m 52s): Actually, I cannot say that because I'm a foreign citizen. it will be an interference by a foreign entity, if I say something. That's actually true. A foreign citizen cannot tell someone else to go vote, that's not in the US I think so. Michael Garfield (1h 5m 54s): Alright, let’s check, can a foreign citizen encourage voting? Vicky Yang (1h 6m 2s): You can't put money into it, but you can do things, is what I remember. But I'm not a hundred percent sure. Michael Garfield (1h 6m 11s): Yeah. I'll look into that. This has been fun, and I really appreciate the two of you taking the time to discuss your research. I hope that this has been as illuminating for our listeners as it has been for me. And I wish you the best with following up, furthering your processes of discovery. Thank you.
43,  Episode Notes Welcome to COMPLEXITY, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I’m your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week we’ll bring you with us for far-ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe.This week we present something different: SFI’s InterPlanetary Project is excited to announce a new podcast, Alien Crash Site, in which we ask some of the most interesting people we know — scientists, artists, authors, and athletes — what strange technologies they might hope to find in a “Zone” like the alien visitation area from the Strugatsky brothers’ novel, Roadside Picnic (adapted to film as Stalker by Andrei Tarkovsky). In this special teaser episode, we present clips from the first three episodes of Alien Crash Site, hosted by IPFest Director Caitlin McShea, with guests:David Krakauer, SFI President, evolutionary biologist, and William H.

Thanks and enjoy! David Wolpert (0s):Well, everybody in high school has had this little exercise of curve fitting. You draw down some graph paper, you draw some dots. You say, fit the curve. And you're like many other people. You might react with annoyance saying, “How are you going to prove to me that one fit is right, and the other one's wrong?” and No Free Lunch Theorem says, “You know, you annoying little brat kid who said that to the teacher, you were right!” In point of fact, if little Jack and little Jill are both doing curve fitting exercises, and you find that Jack does much, much better, in all the tests of curve fitting than Jill does, that doesn't mean that when they go out into the outside world, that Jack’s fits to curves are actually going to be any better than Jill’s fits, even though she won all the tests and exams inside the school. That's why you can't prove the scientific method works. Michael Garfield (1m 12s):On the one hand, we have math - a world of forms and patterns, a priori logic, timeless, and consistent. On the other, we have physics - messy and embodied interactions, context-dependent and contingent on a changing world. And yet many people will get the two confused, including physicists and mathematicians. Where the two meet and the nature of the boundary between them is a matter of debate, one of the greatest puzzles known to science and philosophy, but some things can be said for sure about what can and cannot be accomplished in the search forever better models of our world. One is that every model must contain assumptions and that there's no way to prove a given strategy will outperform all others in all possible scenarios. This insight captured in the legendary, No Free Lunch Theorems by SFI’s David Wolpert and William McCrady has enormous implications for the way we think about intelligence, computers and the living world. In the 20 plus years since its publication, No Free Lunch has sparked intense debate about the kinds of claims we are, and are not, justified in making. Michael Garfield (2m 37s):Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far-ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week, we speak with SFI professor David Wolpert about the No Free Lunch Theorems and what they mean for life, the universe and everything.

I am truly sitting at the feet of a master here for this episode. So I'm going to enter the dojo with beginner's mind and encourage all of the listeners to, to join me in shedding their priors, their assumptions coming into this conversation. And we'll just see if we can do something we don't usually do on this show, which is to look at an idea that you have developed over decades in your career and build it up from, sort of, the prima materia and then explore its implications. David Wolpert (4m 20s):Sounds cool. All kinds of metaphors that come to mind by the way, as somebody who's got true beginner's mind, true Buddha nature that you would like in the jujitsu match, I would be the one flipped out of the ring if you actually can achieve that state. So… Michael Garfield (4m 35s):Well, probably not. I'd like to start this conversation as we always do, but just a little bit about like a personal background of like how you became a scientist, because I know a little bird told me that there was a while there that you were actually considering pursuing a degree in creative writing. David Wolpert (4m 56s):Oh, geez. Yeah. Michael Garfield (4m 58s):I'm, I'm curious to know what got you onto the path that we're on today. David Wolpert (5m 04s):Okay, it's kind of funny. One of the places I've got to in my, in my journey, so to speak is that anything about me is irrelevant. It's all about what I can actually do for things outside. But for what it's worth, yeah, when I was an undergrad, I was thinking about math, physics and creative writing. That's kind of what I was thinking, coming in. Creative writing - I always gravitated, still gravitate, to the very short form. And I realized right off the bat that this was not a way I was going to make any kind of money. So scotch that. It was interesting, physics versus math, this is something I'm still not sure I understand in that I've always looked up to people who are mathematicians. They, from my perspective, at the feet of those daisies, they're able to do things that I could just dream of doing. But what I found to be strange when I was an undergrad, was that the people who are really, really good at math, who could kick my petunias out of the room in the math courses, they tripped and fell in the physics courses. And I never figured it out, but one way or another, after that kind of shaking and stirring, I ended up focusing mostly on physics.  Michael Garfield (6m 18s)Maybe they just forgot there was a room. David Wolpert (6m 21s)It was very, very strange, I mean, it's something about the cliche about different minds, but, you know, there's like in math itself, there's geometric versus algebraic thinking, and, but there are also found that people that would, from the outside world might be viewed as almost synonymous, like Ed Witten is both a stunning mathematician and a stunning theoretical physicist. But when you get down like, many, many levels below Ed, there's actually a different kind of a mind that excels at math versus one that excels at physics. It's kind of peculiar. I'm not sure really what there is to that. But anyway, Michael Garfield (6m 58s):Maybe that's a David Kinney question. It kind of reminds me of, you know, where they say first, we must assume a perfectly spherical cow. And maybe it's a philosophical question. And to that I think, I hope that we get some time today to talk about implications for the philosophy of science, from your work, because that's key here, but what I want to talk to you about today with the assumption that we're going to get more of these, because the list of papers that you sent me by email that you have published over the years is just so vast in scope, that one episode is not going to do you justice. So I feel like today, what I want to do is I want to chunk out the No Free Lunch Theorem and walk people through what drew you in to this particular line of inquiry. And then we can, we can take it from there. David Wolpert (7m 51s):Okay, cool. So, I guess let’s start with the personal aspect of it, rather than it itself. One of the things I'm always concerned about in life is to make sure that you are very aware of your own defects and your own strengths so that you don't drink your own Kool-aid. One of my major character flaws, I have found over the years, trying to figure those things out about myself is that I am extremely sceptical. That's good for being a scientist, but it's not necessarily a good way to run through life. So whenever somebody would say A, I would always want to find a flaw in it, which is true for many cocky physicists and so on. David Wolpert (8m 32s):So anyway, I was working on what has since been, I'm going to be calling machine learning back in the early days before even that phrase was substantiated. And there were a bunch of people going around saying that we have first-principle proofs with no assumptions, that our particular algorithm is going to do better than other algorithms. So this is without any assumption about the world saying that um yes, um you should buy my thing because I can guarantee to you mathematically that my thing is going to outperform Mike Garfield's thing. I've got proof of it. It doesn't matter what the world is, this is mathematics. I don't need, you're talking about David Kinney and philosophy of science has all kinds of things they call about analytic versus synthetic philosophy, analytic truths being those that do not depend upon the actual state of the real physical world versus synthetic ones. And people were claiming that you could actually do what's called inductive inference, making predictions, doing machine learning, purely analytically, without worrying about the state of the real world.  David Wolpert (9m 38s):So my character flaw got really all very stimulated by this and said, bull feces, no way shape or form can that possibly be true? It's obviously not true. I can have as much data that I want that makes me think that tomorrow the sun's gonna come up, but it might not come up, and you're not going to be able to give me a mathematical proof to the contrary. David Wolpert (10m 03s):It doesn't matter how many times I've been through it, sunrise. And we can't say that evolution managed to produce a version of me that is really able to do these predictions really well because the same argument holds at a higher level. Evolution in the past couple of billions of years, it's all been producing new organisms, new predicting machines that have been based upon conditions that for all we know might stop. It's like the warning message at the bottom of prospectuses for mutual funds. Past performance is no indicator of future performance. So anyway, um frankly, I tried to shut up these other people who are making claims about both in the context of optimization theory and in the context of machine learning that they could prove things from first principles. I wrote what I thought was a kind of a trivial theorems proving no, that's not true. David Wolpert (11m 04s):In a formal sense, well, it's kind of funny how people have misinterpreted the No Free Lunch Theorem I use as a trick, a mathematical trick saying, let's assume that basically all worlds are equally probable a priori, that there is no basis for one or the other, given that assumption you're able to prove - this is me and Bill McCrady and some other people I was collaborating with. He was also at the Santa Fe Institute at the time - using that trick, you're able to prove that point of fact, Mike's algorithm is going to completely fail relative to David's just as often as things go the other way around, that everything is completely even. that there are many worlds in which Mike kicks David as in which David kicks Mike. And the people misinterpreted it as though we were assuming that all worlds were equally likely, but it was actually just a mathematical tool to prove that there are in fact as many worlds in which the sun will not rise tomorrow as there are in which it will rise. David Wolpert (12m 08s):And you're not going to be able to use math to do that, it's a contingent fact based upon the nature of the real world, so it's kind of obvious. And I sort of, Bill and I, we publish a paper too, we assumed that it would, people would come back and say, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I meant all along, and we would just move on. But that's not what happened, there were major wars. I, we were just little, you know, little kids. We were clever, we were postdocs just like so many others at the SFI are, but in other words, we were not established with anything like tenure behind us and so on. And there were things like keynote speeches in conferences where I was called - keynote speech very first sentence - David Wolpert is a neanderthal on the postdoc. And there was a lot of this kind of stuff going on. So, actually I left academia for a while because of all of this. And I never really came back full hog to machine learning because it was so vicious. It was impressive.   Michael Garfield (13m 16s):So the No Free Lunch piece of this, this, this, just for folks that don't get the reference. The, my understanding is that this is about bars in the 19th century, trying to lure in clientele with the offer of free food. When you purchase a drink, David Wolpert (13m 33s):Oh, you mean the phrase No Free Lunch. Michael Garfield (13m 36s):Yes, to, to provide like a, a street level example of what we're talking about here, we're talking about like, you, it would be impossible to find a restaurant in which you can acquire David Wolpert (13m 52s):Where you can have your cake and eat it too, without paying for it being the crucial thing. So actually that wasn't a phrase due to me or Bill, it was suggested by somebody else. Yes, and the general, the reference is that if you are going to be getting anything, you got to pay for it, you don't get something for free, you don't get a lunch for free. You might think that you do, but at the end of the day, the restauranteur or whoever's going to come to you and say, that was, glad you enjoyed the meal. Now we have an hour of mop work back in the kitchen that we need you to do to pay for it. And you always have that hour of mop work. David Wolpert (14m 28s):And so, in this context, the idea would be similarly, something along the lines of, yeah, you can get your algorithm to perform well, that's the lunch, but no you're going to have to pay for it, and that you are making assumptions. And to scientists working on machine learning, making assumptions about the real world is something that is a cost, you don't want to do that. You want to be able to, I can sell you a whole, much, many more autonomous vehicles if I tell you that I got mathematical proofs, that their AI algorithms are navigating without any assumptions based on the real world. I can prove it to you, just like I can prove the quadratic equation or anything else, that my autonomous vehicle is going to be doing better than somebody else's. That's the way to make a lot of money. People don't like it when you actually say no, that's not the case. But so that would be the, the free lunch, being able to have that kind of autonomous vehicle where it's, you don't have to pay with any kind of assumption about the real world that you can prove from first principles that this autonomous vehicle does better than some other one. Michael Garfield (15m 32s):So, the idea of an organism as an inference, you know, a hypothesis about its environment. This is kind of akin to, as I understand it, the statement out of evolutionary biology, that there is no evolutionary up, that there's contextual fitness, but like an alien when Ash says that the Xenomorph the alien monster is the perfect organism, that there is no such thing. That it’s counterfactual because you know, evolution could not produce something that would not be outperformed in some unanticipated…David Wolpert (16m 07s):That's the, that's the nub of it. And um, because the actual precise formulation is not that there could not be a perfect thing, but that you cannot prove it the way that you can start, like, I don't know what the precise, best way to pitch this is, but a lot of people have encountered Pythagorean theory. If I give you a triangle where it's perfectly 90 degrees and so on and so forth, we know that the length of the hypotenuse, its square is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two. And this gets into all kinds of extraordinarily deep math from that theorem and so on and so forth. But people have seen, when you were in high school, most people have seen actually proof of that, from first principles. The laws of physics can change. The state of civilization can change. The biosphere we live in can change. It won't matter that the Pythagorean theorem will still be true. You can prove it without having to be contingent on anything about the outside world. If there were an organism going through evolution, that for some reason or other, was going around saying, “The Pythagorean theorem! The Pythagorean theorem!”, it would always be correct. And it doesn't matter what ecosystem it finds itself in. David Wolpert (17m 23s):This is the basis of a lot of the stuff in SETI, the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. People like to say that it doesn't matter how alien aliens are, they will still, for lack of a better word, and it's a very lowly one, they'll still believe math, they will still know math. They will still be able to grok, to use another very dated phrase, the Pythagorean theorem. That'll still be something that's in their little kit of truths. That is very, very different from contingent facts. Things like the laws of physics, things like the laws of biology. I can very easily imagine a biosphere in which it's not true that you have genotypes that code for phenotypes by going through messenger RNA and transfer RNA, that living systems work entirely differently. David Wolpert (18m 12s):In fact, that's what the whole field of artificial life is about, is trying to cook up such things and see where they take us. But you're not going to be able to cook up any such world in which the Pythagorean theorem fails. So, what the hell has that got to do with anything with the No Free Lunch? It's a no-go theorem. It's an impossibility theorem. It says that if somebody comes to you and says, “I've got an autonomous vehicle that, independent of the state of the world, just like I can prove to you the Pythagorean theorem, I can prove to you that this autonomous vehicle is safe”, don't believe them. If somebody comes up to you and says that “I can run an AI algorithm, it's going to predict the next election. And I can prove mathematically that it’s correct”, just like the Pythagorean theorem, don't believe them. Those things are always going to be contingent. And the No Free Lunch Theorem says that as soon as you get something else, it basically is a way of formalizing the dividing line between contingent truths, like who's gonna win. And here's where my prayer hands come out and so on, versus ones like the Pythagorean theorem. And dear God, I wish I could use the Pythagorean theorem to actually right now answer that first question. But you can't, and that's what the No Free Lunch Theorem tells you. Nope, we can't do that now. Michael Garfield (19m 25s):There's a paper that you wrote with Bill McCready on co-evolutionary free lunches. Again, you're talking about that dividing line between the sort of Imperion perfection of the abstract mathematical, like Sean Carroll multi-verse, in which we're having this conversation. And then the reality of the actual universe that we have, you know, the N equals one, this is our biosphere. This is what we have. So I'd like to talk about where there are free lunches. David Wolpert (19m 53s):There's a bunch of them. Yeah. And so this is what I think, I mean, this is, to be honest, I was really kind of disappointed in machine learning because to me, these kinds of issues are the skeleton upon which we could then figure out all kinds of very innocuous assumptions that everybody can agree on, that we could then use to close the skeleton a little bit and have those go into our autonomous vehicles. But I don't know, it threatened too many people's livelihoods or something, but there are free lunches. Like as Dr. Ivy had way back in the day, I had a pair of back-to-back papers, one called the lack of a priori distinctions between the algorithms and one called the existence of a priori distinction between algorithms. They were back-to-back. Michael Garfield (20m 40s):Is that a reproducibility crisis? David Wolpert (20m 43s):Yeah, the big four. So the No Free Lunch Theorems say that you cannot have a mathematical proof of a certain sort. In a certain sense you can view them as like Girdles and Completeness Theorem. Girdles and Completeness Theorem is also putting limitations on what you could ever mathematically prove, no matter how long you want to work at it. No Free Lunch Theorems are the same common thing. There are limitations, for example, way back when people, you know, all kinds of arguments about whether you should use genetic algorithms or simulate a kneeling or hill search or things like this, in doing optimization. And one of the very first papers that Bill and I did said, No Free Lunch, you cannot actually prove from first principles that any one of those search algorithms is any better than any other without making assumptions, the same kind of thing in evolution that you can't do it. So that's what the No Free Lunch Theorems were, but they were very, very finely tuned, like the Coevolution and Free Lunch Theorems, which have to do with natural selection, I mean, that's what Coevolution is all about. They were saying, expand your sandbox a little bit. Rather than just thinking about things like David and Michael going head-to-head and making predictions about the precise swing of the popular vote a month from now, let's say, that's what we're doodling about. David Wolpert (22m 10s):And I've got my algorithm that makes a prediction and you've got yours. And that's a very, very precise thing. And the No Free Lunch Theorem states, you cannot mathematically prove that Michael's is better than David's. Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t, it depends on the nature of the physical world. It turns out that there are other things where you can prove that, so to speak, David and Michael operating together as a team can beat certain other teams in a co-evolutionary context. David Wolpert (22m 38s):So for the listeners out there in podcast land, the difference between evolution and co-evolution - the notion of evolution, fitness landscapes, this goes back to someone called Ronald Fisher, who by the way, turned out to be a racist dude. And that's causing all kinds of problems because there are buildings that have his name on them, but he was also one of the most brilliant statisticians and theoretical biologists ever. There's something called the Fisher Information, for example, which is all about him, Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of biology. David Wolpert (23m 11s):So anyway, there was Fisher and Sewall Wright and so on. They had this notion of a fitness landscape, which is the idea that if David and Michael are both undergoing evolution, we have our offspring who had their own offspring and so on and so forth, that we're both trying to do a search over a fitness landscape. It's the same landscape. We both want to get up to the high peaks of that fitness landscape, and that's how we do well. That's sort of the early, very early 20th century, simple-minded, first path version of natural selection. That's called evolution. Co-evolution says, “Well, no, no, no, no, no!” What actually determines David's fitness landscape partially is whatever the hell Michael's doing and what determines Michael's landscape, partly it's whatever the hell David's doing. So it's not like we're both independent agents trying to find the best we can do over this landscape. It's a co-evolutionary process. We are making one another's fitness functions simultaneously. David Wolpert (24m 11s):There are similar things in economic systems. It's not that different companies are all independently trying to find the best widget that they can then sell to the populus. Instead, what the populus is actually going to want to buy from me is going to depend a bit on what the other companies are doing, because they're going to be affecting the preferences of the populus, and what kinds of things might actually be able to partner with my widgets and vice- versa. It’s all one big hairball - that's a polite way of phrasing it for a podcast! There are other phrases with biological connotations but it’s one big hairball. Everybody's affecting everybody else simultaneously, we’re not all independent. That's the essence of co-evolution versus evolution. David Wolpert (24m 54s):One of the huge understandings and appreciations of localized game theory, all kinds of stuff, all kinds of edifying stuff, it's all about co-evolution. So anyway, we can now ask the question, if David versus Michael, in a standard evolutionary situation, we're saying who's going to do better at getting to high fitness values where we're both evolving at this fixed independent fitness landscape, just like in Fisher and Sewall Wright, that's where No Free Lunch comes in and says that you cannot, without knowing the shape of that landscape, you cannot say who's going to do better - David or Michael. They’re two search algorithms, trying to get higher than that landscape. David Wolpert (25m 33s):But now let's say you've got a more complicated situation where David's landscape has been determined by Michael and vice-versa. Can it be the case that they can both behave in such a way so that both of them benefit and get to higher fitness values? Can you prove that in first principles, and there, the answer turns out to be yes. So another way to phrase it is that you can, from first principles, you can prove that certain structures of human societies where they're interacting with one another, yes you can prove that as just as the Pythagorean theorem holds, some of those structures will actually benefit the aggregate without any dependence on contingent facts of the world. Whereas everybody's in isolation, now that is going to depend upon contingent facts of the world. So I don't know, health draws a metaphor too many. Michael Garfield (26m 23s):Yeah, no, that was good. What got me interested in the work that SFI was doing was I found Martin Novak's papers with Natalia Komarova on the evolution of syntax and language in 2005. And didn't realize David Krakauer had been working with Novak on this stuff in like earlier papers. So it was a weird random walk directly to your faded address coming to work here. Yeah, that work was seemed immediately generalizable to stuff like the advent of multicellularity and organisms or the emergence of social primates. You know, there's a sense that there are, and I know that there's far more forms of co-evolutionary gaming than just endosymbiotic inclusion. Michael Garfield (27m 17s):I think in this paper that you wrote with McCready, it's, it's more about choosing a champion and like players training someone that they then sort of delegate, whereas like there's this other piece of it, which is, and I'm wondering if I'm getting this, that it seems as though there is a sort of, I guess the formal term would be like a macro-evolutionary ratchet into these more collective organisms. David Wolpert (27m 46s):So a couple of things going on there, one of them are kind of meta statement about science is that we had this general intuition, that co-evolutionary kinds of things were not going to be subject to the No Free Lunches extreme forum. So what we then did was try to find the simplest kind of a scenario that we could analyse, that would illustrate that. So that was too largely what was going on. Another one, that whole notion of choosing your champion, that actually is another aspect of kind of the sociology of science in all of these modern reinforcement-learning based game players, AlphaGo all of these other ones. So not, you know, Deep Blue, where you just do it all by hand, but the ones that are based upon learning. What's going on in all of them, what's ubiquitous is that you have the algorithm that's learning how to play, and then you've got another antagonist that's learning how to try to screw the odds with him. And that's what was what's called adversarial networks, it's one of the deep tricks in all machine learning these days. Now, if you trace back its evolutionary process, that idea, it traces back to some work primarily by a guy with David Fogel and way back when, when he actually designed checker players using what he called co-evolution. David Wolpert (29m 16s):So the idea was that on the one hand, you got a learning algorithm of your checker player, but you also got its opponent that you're also learning training independently, trying to have it find situations to screw the checker player. You're trying to come up with game situations that will screw your checker player and so on and so forth. And that was actually the major insight. Everything subsequent to then, as is the case in so much of machine learning, has been really machine learning has been window-dressing based upon elaborating and embellishing those deep insights. So anyway, part of the reason that we chose that particular champion model that you were talking about for the paper was we wanted something that was simple to analyse, but also at the time, this was one of the new ideas of them that was circulating, was co-evolution as it was being called in the sense of training checker-playing algorithms. And so that's why we were thinking in terms of training champions,Michael Garfield (30m 15s):Right? I'm thinking back to the conversation David Krakauer and I had about your piece for the SFI transmission series early back in the spring, you're talking about the Landauer Bound and how the virus sort of outsources its computational duties to the host organism. The conversation I had with Geoffrey West on the podcast back in like 35 and 36, when we were talking about his findings that the human being is way, way off of the line, when you look at where we should be for our body mass and our metabolism, and like the amount of energy used by a modern human being includes, you know, all of these remote server farms and all of this other stuff that we don't conventionally think of as bound within that particular individual. Michael Garfield (31m 06s):I guess when I hear this stuff about adversarial learning, it sounds like this is interrogating where we decide to draw the boundaries between individuals and maybe we're skirting over into some of the other work you've done on like information theory. But it suggests that even in antagonistic relations, that there is a sort of higher, like a coarser frame, where both parties, the components of a larger system that's outperforming because it has folded up opposition into itself. David Wolpert (31m 42s):Lennon and McCartney, Jagger and Richards, Picasso and Matisse – the whole notion that the best I can hope for, if I'm really good, if I want to be really good, I've got to have somebody that I can measure myself against, and who can spur me to do better things and I've got to get p****d off that they can outcompete me. And yeah, that's a dynamic that happens a lot, and that is very much part and parcel of the adversarial formulation. But they are finding the chinks in my armor and therefore, by fixing that armor, I'm actually making myself, you know, be far stronger and far better than if I don't have them to find those chinks in my armor, then I'm screwed. I need them to do that for me. And I then do it for them. Michael Garfield (32m 31s):So I guess really what I'm getting at is, is it distinct from a kind of a champion type scenario because both of those scenarios are team play, even if the agents in those different scenarios may not regard themselves as on the same team? David Wolpert (32m 47s):Yeah, so I think what you're getting at is where do you draw the dividing line? So if I want to look at the Red Sox and Yankees, if I take them as a unit, then No Free Lunch applies. If I take the outside landscape as a fixed thing that they are both trying to be the best joint baseball team, whatever that would mean, then you have no free lunch. But if they are instead spurring one another on, so in fact there are no other teams – so I mean I'm trying to sort of run with this contorted analogy I'm making with baseball - but how many teams are there even?  Michael Garfield (33m 25s)They’re like monopolies, like corporate duopolies. David Wolpert (33m 29s)Sort of there's all other kinds of things that go on there, in terms of profit taking and so on, they don't really spur one another. In real economics, what duopolies do, all duopolies in general. is that they carve out niches and then they will not compete. But here's kind of what it would not do. How many baseball teams are there now, even? I don't know, make up a number… Michael Garfield (33m 48s):Wrong guy, dozens, 36. David Wolpert (33m 50s):So dozens, whatever, let's say, there's three dozen, that's 36. And here’s your Googlian cheater, talking about outsourcing your complex computation and so on, and where do you end? And what's the end of the individual and the extended phenotype and all that stuff. So the Red Sox and Yankees, if they were the only two teams in baseball, and they were spurring one another on. And what they wanted to do was - I'm not sure this metaphor is going to really work - but it's got to do with, as you were saying, in terms of where you draw the line between individual versus pairs, if the Red Sox and Yankees are all that they are, so they're setting one another's fitness function, then they can spur one another to do better and better in some kind of objective absolute sense. David Wolpert (34m 35s):Whereas, if they are instead embedded in a bigger league, then units of Yankees Red Sox can't actually do any better due to No Free Lunch than would any other arbitrary units, if that makes any kind of a sense. I mean, some of these things, I mean to riff on it, here's another example that's actually in many, many ways more striking, and it'll take a little bit of work to get this to a level that when we can convey it in a podcast, but there's this thing called the scientific method. And we all like the scientific method. It does great things. It gives you refrigerators like that one behind your head. And it helps us spread coronavirus across the world, much better than we would be able to if we hadn't had the scientific method giving us airplanes. All kinds of benefits that come with the scientific method. David Wolpert (35m 26s):Okay, cool. But let's be a little bit more, sort of head in the clouds, philosophical about it, we’re pointy head, geeky academics. Let's try to think - why might the scientific method work and how might I actually exploit the scientific method, if for example, I was doing machine learning? Well, that's something that might be cool if you want to make a ton of money in machine learning, the scientific method, that works well. I'm doing similar kinds of things - I need to make stuff that will be able to predict and do well, just like mathematical experience that can predict and do well. So can I exploit it? And so it turns out that you can, and the way that you can is with a technique called cross-validation.David Wolpert (36m 05s):So here's the basic idea behind cross-validation. Michael and David are two training algorithms that we're going to be training to do something like say, image recognition. We want to train David and Michael, both of them, they're going to be trained on a dataset of images that are either dogs or cats, and they've gotta be able to then be able to predict well for some completely new images they're not seeing whether it's a dog or a cat. David Wolpert (36m 30s):Now along comes David Krakauer, head of the SFI. And he says, “”=Well, I want to be able to choose whether I should now hire Michael or hire David as my machine that's going to go out and distinguish cat images from dog images, but I've only got this fixed set of images. How am I going to choose which one I want to hire? I better choose either David or Michael, but how am I going to choose?” Well, there's the obvious thing. Take my fixed set of images. Let David and Michael both learn as much as they can from a subset of those images. And now simply see which of them, David or Michael, who does better on the remaining images that they haven't seen? And use that to decide who I want to train on all of my images, and so who I'm going to hire and go out in the world. What’s really important to me is to be able to distinguish images of dogs versus cats. David Wolpert (37m 25s):That is in a certain sense, the scientific method. You're choosing between David and Michael - who's a better theorist - by saying, well, who, when they make theories. comes up with one that does better on experiments they've not yet seen? It's also, it turns out, a technique called cross validation, which is embedded in every single machine learning algorithm out there. It is how you choose among parameters in algorithms are true among algorithms to see which one does better. And it seems almost controvertible. That's got to do well, scientific method has to do well. It's very, very natural. How could it not work? Well, it turns out that this is a domain in which No Free Lunch actually does work. David Wolpert (38m 10s)And moreover, what it lets us do is the following. Let's say that David Krakauer comes along and chooses whether to hire Michael or David, based upon who does better at making the classification of dogs versus cats on images that they haven't seen yet - a very reasonable way for David to come along and make his choice. Then Geoff West comes along – Gandalf - a very curmudgeonly kind of a fellow, who says, “No, David, I don't believe any of that. What I'm going to do is I'm going to also choose between your Wolpert and Michael Garfield and hire one of them to tell me whether a new image is a dog or a cat. But the way that I'm going to make my hiring decision is not to see whether David or Michael is more accurate on a given test set that I'm giving them, like you're doing David Krakauer, silly man. Instead, I'm going to choose between them based on who does worse.” David Wolpert (39m 09s)So David and Michael have both come up with their theory, their little code. They've written their little algorithm to choose between to classify an image on whether it is a dog or cat. And there I now have a test set in which we're taking these algorithms, these codes and seeing which one does better. And Michael's code does better on this little test set that neither David nor Michael has seen before than those for better classifying dogs, which is captain David's code. So therefore David Krakauer hires Mike Garfield. Geoff West in the same situation, being curmudgeonly and a contrarian, he chooses David, who on all the experiments so far, David has ucked up, he has gone down in flames. Michael did much better. Based upon that, Goeff West, the contrarian chooses David, David Wolpert (39m 59s)Guess what No Free Lunch Theorem says, it says that there are many real universes in which Geoff West just made the better choice as in which as David Krakauer did. And it is extremely weird that that should be the case. No Free Lunch Theorems tell us that's true. It contradicts common sense, and in terms of the mathematical theory, it's actually very, very difficult to make test domains like the fictional dogs versus cats that actually demonstrate this. David Wolpert (40m 32s):They have to be as common as test domains in which the scientific method works. The anti-scientific method has to actually beat the scientific method just as often as the other way around. But it's very, very hard to construct little experimental test beds in which that's true, but the No Free Lunch Theorems say it is true. And this is something very deep about our world that the scientific method actually works. Nobody actually, rather than the ad hoc technique of cross- validation, nobody's got a mathematical Pythagorean theorem proof across co-evolution works, because you can't have one like No Free Lunch, but it does work. It works damn well better than anything else. And nobody has a f*****g clue as to why science works, in this kind of a formal proven, like you prove the Pythagorean theorem, sense. Michael Garfield (41m 25s):So this seems tied to the question of why does math work at all? David Wolpert (41m 31s):They’re related, yup. Michael Garfield (41m 32s):I'm glad that we're here now, because you know, in the philosophy of science question of, you know, like Simon Tedale gave that talk to the applied complexity network last week about conspiracy theories, and how you can't really fault someone for being a conspiracy theorist because we're all applying an aesthetic preference, if you will, towards, you know, we're, we're seeking simple, consilient, unifying explanations. And so we look for the lowest Komogarov complexity or whatever. David Wolpert (42m 10s):Yeah, that's an easy one, No Free Lunches smack up in the middle. It says going for …raiser, lowest common Komogarov complexity, that's an easy one. It's easy to find situations where that dies. Cross validation is the harder one. Yeah, but you're right, it's the same adjacent thing that the conspiracy theorists, it's a contingent fact of the world. Is Q Anon full of it or are they actually, everything that they're saying is true? Well, if you're just a little bit science-fictiony, you can very easily imagine, or you were talking about multi-verses before. There are many, many ways that you can imagine there might be a reality, which agrees with everything that we've seen in our lives, you and me and everybody else, which says no, that's a crock, but it turns out to be true. You can't use the Pythagorean theorem to distinguish between those two. David Wolpert (42m 59s):There's this, you said it's just like Wigner’s comment about the unreasonable effectiveness in the bath, in a physical world. It's actually in a certain sense, putting a wedge between math and the physical world. And that it's saying, here's a sort of phrasing it, the mystery of why the scientific method works. Maybe I actually was too simple-minded in my thinking about what your statement was. One way for the No Free Lunch Theorem is that it drives a wedge between math and physics.  Over on that side are things you can prove with math. And over on this side are things are going to be contingent on the state of the world, with all the sciences, biology, chemistry, physics, economics, sociology, whatever. David Wolpert (43m 39s):And there are some things that don't fit there. I'm just saying that you can't actually take all that power over on the left-hand side of the fence and use it to resolve things on the right-hand side of the fence. It depends on what reality happens to be. But people like Wigner have found that that might be true. He didn't know No Free Lunch Theorems. I actually knew him by the way, very, very briefly, nice guy. He didn't know No Free Lunch Theorems, but he did understand that there was a mystery here about why the mathematical power should actually be so applicable. Why the stuff from the left-hand side of the fence should have so much power on the right-hand side of the fence, and the scientific method, which we can actually formalize. You can write it down. What does it mean? It means cross-validation. We know what it means that there's, in a certain sense, an even deeper mystery why the scientific method works, because whereas why math works or not is a hard question to even formalize, we can formalize question whether the scientific method works or not, and we can prove that it shouldn't. But it does. Michael Garfield (44m 43s):Yeah, exactly. You're right to note, there are two theorems here. One focusing on inference and one on search, right? David Wolpert (44m 54s):Yeah. Optimization in general. Michael Garfield (44m 56s):Yeah, I'd like to hear you differentiate those a little bit and cause, cause you know, this is related to a lot of the other work that's going on at SFI and just sort of understanding a general theory of intelligence and like what intelligence and adaptation even are, when we're defining complex systems by calling them adaptive matter. What do we mean? So I mean, aside from the fact that this is arguably, reality is where formalisms fail, right? That this is a, you know, we're, we're just, we're trying to climb up a vertical slope here. The theories we construct are just like whatever sand pile we happen to be standing on.David Wolpert (45m 39s): Yup. Michael Garfield (45m 40s):I'm curious to hear you talk about differentiating those two theorems and what that implies about intelligence more broadly. David Wolpert (45m 50s):Okay. So those two theorems actually in a certain sense, aren't differentiated, we've found after the ones for machine learning were written, those are the first ones, proving that, I mean, the intuition is actually another way I've seen. It's very, very simple. Everybody in high school has had this little exercise of curve fitting. You draw down some graph paper, you draw some dots and you say fit the curve. And you're like many other people you might react with annoyance saying, “How you gonna prove to me that one fit is right and another one's wrong?” And No Free Lunch Theorem says, “You know, you annoying little brat kid who said that to the teacher. You were right.” And it's similar. If you ever see these things like the back of newspapers, or I guess online versions now, where they are intelligence tests, complete the following sequence. And if you're like me, you would look at that and get really annoyed and say, “This is stupid! There's no right or wrong answer. I can put any number I want down there, any letter. And you're not going to be able to prove to me I'm right or I'm wrong. This is a stupid intelligence test!”  And that bratty kid, that bratty person reading these intelligence tests, the blank papers , they're right. That's what the No Free Lunch Theorem says. That's the core idea. David Wolpert (47m 03s):What it was first applied to was what's called machine learning, because curve fitting is all that machine learning is. Curve fitting, you've got that little graph paper. Rather than dots that you're drawing a line through, on your x-axis are instead images. And then your Y axis, it's basically labels: are you a cat or are you a dog? And all any image recognition machine is doing is curve-fitting, in that rather more exotic kind of a space, that's it. David Wolpert (47m 32s):And No Free Lunch says, just like you were doing in school, when you're fitting those dots, there's no right or wrong answers. You can't prove that there's one that's right or wrong. And then this whole business about cross-validation says that, in point of fact, if little Jack and little Jill are both in curve-fitting exercises and you find that Jack does much, much better in all the tests of curve-fitting than Jill does, that doesn't mean that when they go out into the outside world, that Jack's fits to curves are actually going to be any better than Jill's fits, even though he won all the tests and exams inside the school room. That's why you can't prove the scientific method works. The scientific methods all work in the school room where Jack, who happens to be the person who came up with quantum mechanics, the people who came up with quantum mechanics, they did a much, much better curve-fitting. But then when we go outside of that, then it might turn out that Jill's actually doing much, much better than that in point of fact, ….. is correct or something like that. And so to answer your question in this roundabout way, we realized that that same basic idea could apply if you are trying to do a search algorithm when you don't know what the underlying fitness function is, or if you're trying to draw a curve between some dots. It's the same basic principle that the bratty kid enunciated so well back in second grade. Michael Garfield (48m 55s):Yeah. For instance, Melanie Mitchell and Jessica Flack’s recent piece in Aeon, talking about how you create key performance indicators in the workplace, and then people attune to that, and then there's a drift and you're not actually measuring what you thought you were measuring. Everyone knows good students don't, I mean, um, I was a high-testing kid. David Wolpert (49m 16s):Laughter. Michael Garfield (49m 16s):That was a rude awakening. I know you got a hard stop in about a minute, but I just have to ask, you know, given the vertigo of this revelation, how you even continued doing science for another 20 plus years? David Wolpert (49m 36s):Yeah, one minute it's turtles all the way down. It is exactly as you said, what sandbox you choose to be in. There has never been an argument that anybody has offered that refutes the hypothesis that you’re a brain in a vat. It gets better, in terms of your memories, which you think are real. From a physics point of view, memories are just retrodiction. They are predictions of the past, rather than the future. There is actually no legitimate reason for believing your memories, any more than you would believe your predictions. It's just, we'd like to think that this fore-accuracy is better but we can't be sure. And No Free Lunch, in some of my notes to myself, I refer to that as THE PROBLEM, all in caps, because it's saying a similar kind of a thing with the entire scientific method. All of these things are different aspects of the fact that it's turtles all the way down, that doesn't bottom out. David Wolpert (50m 31s):It’s when you appreciate that, that you go back to the beginner's mind like you were talking about today, this whole podcast ties itself up. That's when you get to Zen. That's when you achieve such heart, you realize that no, there ain’t nothing down there. All that we can be doing is trying to figure out some of the structure up at this level that we happen to be. You know this turtle is standing on that turtle, standing on this turtle. So, but let's take that bottom turtle as a given. I can say something about this local structure of turtles, but there's nothing underneath it all. Ultimately, any turtle I might want to stand on might just burp and yertle the turtle, and we all come falling down. Michael Garfield (51m 09s)Well, that feels like a timely sentiment. That's an important thing to bear in mind, amidst the turbulence and uncertainty of our time as David. Thank you so much for taking the time.David Wolpert (51m 27s)All right, I hope people get some value out. Michael Garfield (51m 32s)Yeah. And I look forward to having you on again, to lead us by the hand into, you know, some other ineffable zone. David Wolpert (51m 40s)Yeah. Philosophy hits the road Michael Garfield (51m 44s)Take care. David Wolpert (51m 45s)Take it easy. Michael Garfield (51m 48s):Thank you for listening.

Thank you! Organisms aren't the only products of the evolutionary process - cultural products, such as writing, art, and music also undergo change over time - subject to both, the constraints of the physical environment, and the psychologies of those who make them. In recent years, the study of cultural evolution has exploded with new insights:  Revelations into the dynamics of how culture is transmitted, how it mutates under different pressures, and why some forms are remarkably resilient and stable across time and space. Just as in biology, pattern in the structures of our artifacts converge on universals and diverge to meet the needs of their distinct environments.Certain forces ratchet up complexity and culture, whereas others act like gravity, and draw the works of different societies into shared basins of attraction.  Finding the fundamentals behind both the unity and the diversity of cultures, and what cultural evolution does and doesn't have in common with biological evolution, is a field of rich mystery.  New research into the structural and cognitive constraints on culture leads us into some of the most fertile questions known to science.Welcome to COMPLEXITY, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far-ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers - developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe.This week, we speak to SFI Complexity Postdoctoral Fellow, Omidyar Fellow, and ASU-SFI Center Fellow, Helena Miton about her work on cultural evolution — namely, her recent Royal Society Proceedings Paper on " How material constraints affect the cultural evolution of rhythm," with Thomas Wolf, Cordula Vesper, Günther Knoblich, and Dan Sperber; and the Current Anthropology pre-print she authored on "The predictable evolution of letter shapes: An emergent script of West Africa recapitulates historical change in writing systems" with Piers Kelly, James Winters, and Olivia Morin.

Thank you for listening. MG (2m 41s):It's a pleasure to have you on Complexity, and especially so, after the flurry of technical difficulties leading up to this! Helena Miton (HM):Thanks for having me. MG:Today I want to talk about two pieces - one you lead authored, and one you contributed to as the third author.  One will have come out in Proceedings, Royal Society B by the time this episode airs, and the other one is still in pre-print in Current Anthropology until next year. So, it's very exciting that we have an opportunity to discuss this paper while it's still, sort of, in the womb. Before we get into your research, I would just love to have you give people a little bit of your biography and your backstory. Like what got you interested in scientific research and your path into your PhD program, and to SFI? HM (4m 1s):I did a BA in sociology, first. And I kind of got frustrated with some of the shortcomings, to me, of sociology, at least as it was taught in the in the BA I was in, and I always had this interest into cognitive science, like since I was a teenager, and I ended up reading those books that are close to what is usually called cognitive anthropology. And I was like, okay, this is the kind of approach I want to have, and that's the kind of research I'd like to do. And I actually ended up working with most of the elders that inspired me to apply to a cognitive science program at that point.So yeah, sociology, then cognitive science as a master’s degree for two years. And then I just followed up doing the same kind of things in my PhD program. MG (4m 53s):Where did you go for your PhD? HM (4m 55s):I did my PhD in Budapest at the Central European University, in the department of cognitive science. And it is a department that has four main labs:  One is a pretty famous one for developmental psychology. Second one is the joint-action one - so, a lot of experimental approaches to how people coordinate in two tasks. Another one, is more visual perception; and kind of the remainder, was this cognitive approach to culture and communication, mixed with a bunch of behavioral economists, kind of experimentalist people, as well. MG (5m 32s):And then how'd you get from Budapest to SFI? HM (5m 37s):It was a bunch of kind of coincidences. I met Vanessa Ferdinand, who used to be a post-doc at SFI, at a conference, and she was very strongly pushing me to apply here. A couple of my supervisors were also pretty pushy about it being a good place for me, and I kind of just trusted them - but mostly after my PhD, I really wanted a pretty autonomous type of fellowship. So that was pretty good. And I've always worked between disciplines, so it was kind of nice being in a place that was really designed for it for once, instead of one where people are trying their best but you don't really get the kind of project of being interdisciplinary from the get-go. MG (6m 21s):Right on. So, the first paper I'd like to discuss with you is dear to my heart, and I imagine the hearts of many listeners - you know, music being such a broadly applicable strain of the human experience.  This piece, “How material constraints affect the cultural evolution of rhythm", was just such a delightful read. And as we'll kind of unspool in this conversation, seems to have links to so many other projects going on at SFI and elsewhere - not only in cultural evolution, but in biological evolution.  I'm just really excited.So I would love for you to start with a little bit of the background about prior research, and what set the stage for you and your coauthors to ask the questions that you decided to ask in this paper - because this is built on like, a pretty robust literature on cultural evolution already.HMThere's a bunch of kind of branches and threads we try to tie, so one of it is the kind of general theoretical framework, which is called Cultural Attraction Theory. And previous names, when it was first started by Dan Sperber, who was one of my PhD supervisors. It was called Epidemiology of Representations.This label didn't encounter as much success as Cultural Attraction Theory, which you can actually call CAT for short...for pretty obvious reasons. So, this theoretical framework, it's now almost mainstream in cultural evolution, but it really wasn't when I started working with it. And I started working with those kinds of concepts during my master’s degree. So actually, by the point I was 19, and eight years ago, sorry, that goes back a while.So this is like a first bunch of things where culture is really considered like a dynamical system to a lot of extent, and like something that is pretty probabilistic, and that you should think in terms of which kind of mutations are not going to be random, because if you get non-random mutation, that's a pretty good way to get things to be culturally stable.Because even if you don't get some kind of good, highly faithful transmission, you're going to have a mechanism that is going to correct for kind of changes. You're going to get back to those kind of stable forms. So that's one part - other parts are kind of developments in terms of, which experiments we are able to run to mimic cultural evolution. So, this paper uses a transmission chain experiment.  That's like the telephone game which you can play with kids, where one kid is going to have one sentence to say to the next kid, and so on and so on. And by the end of the chain, basically you get a very different sentence than what the first kid had to say to the second one.That kind of experiment became like a pretty well-spread tool to study cultural transmission over maybe the last 15 years. And that was a methodology, I already wrote a review paper on, and I already used it in previous work as well, and the last thing was we wanted a kind of good domain where you could get very precise measures and precise predictions. And we were lucky to be in this big European project where we’re really encouraged to work with the different labs we had. And part of the joint action lab at the CU is pretty specialist in doing experiments with music. So, we had a proper music lab that was kind of ready for us to play with. MG (9m 54s):So just to clarify the concept of cultural attraction theory, it sounds basically like it's the same kind of model as the idea that there are attractor basins in a biological… I mean like if you turn an evolutionary fitness landscape upside down and you drain things into it, right. It's like there are paths through that landscape that are more probable than other paths, and that these transmission chain experiments are basically like running massive parallel fruit fly lineages in a laboratory. HM (10m 34s):That’s right. It's kind of like that. I mean, the idea is pretty similar, so we definitely cannot run as many participants as you can run fruit flies, like I would love to, but that's not really possible! It's pretty similar. Some of the people I’ve worked with on it definitely resist to just collapse the both of them mostly because Cultural Attraction Theory for cultural evolution is really meant to be a bit more stochastic than attractors and dynamical systems are. MG (11m 2s):Huh. Are you going to more detail on why that is? No. Okay. Yes, it is one of those things that's like a general theme, it seems like, in SFI - this question about how safe it is to draw these analogies, right? And then people tend to get a little defensive about their discipline, and then other people are like, really eager to just knock down the walls. HM (11m 24s):Yeah, I think in that case, it's also a lot due to the fact that we've really started to formalize Cultural Attraction Theory not that long ago. So, like the oldest models or the ones done by Nicolette Lydia, and they're maybe 13 years old and we're like not a big team or school. So, we're kind of still working on what are proper formalisms of Cultural Attraction Theory. And I think that's the kind of things we haven't figured out completely yet, how much we can borrow from attractors in other fields. MG (11m 56s):All right. So, you make a really important distinction in this paper between ecological factors and psychological factors, and cultural evolution. And I know from before we started this recording, that it's both, important to make that distinction; but then, it's also kind of important to criticize that distinction. And I'd love to hear you unpack what the difference between those two things are, meaningfully, for the sake of this particular study. And then maybe we can go into a little more detail about ways in which those distinctions start to fall apart. HM (12m 33s):Sure. So, maybe first - why is it important to distinguish them? I think it's just in general, if you want to study a phenomenon, it's pretty good if you have a way to parse out what are going to be your different types of causal factors that are going to be at play with it. So that's definitely one first point, and that's definitely part of the things I really like in Cultural Attraction Theory, is it's a pretty good framework and methodology to start playing around with different types of factors. It's pretty flexible for dance. So psychological factors, or cognitive factors, or the ones usually related to how the mind works, roughly; and ecological are pretty much everything that is going to be outside the mind.So this is a distinction Dan started to make I think in 1996, and we've just like tried to work on it a bit more, but it's definitely to be thought of as a continuum with things that are kind of, more in the mind, and others that are more in the environment.  An example of psychological factors would be, for instance, the paper I got published earlier this year on the spatial composition in portraits. MG (13m 41s):Oh yeah. Talk a little bit more about that, because that's actually a really cool paper too. HM (13m 48s):I really like it, because it's also very simple to explain. A lot of people tend to look at profile-oriented portraits of pictures differently, after I told them about the story. So, it's pretty fun.  For bunch of reasons, humans tend to prefer and find more aesthetically pleasing, compositions if you have an agent that is oriented in profile:  you would have more space in front of the agent than behind. So, we just wanted to check out whether that's actually true in European portraiture. And we collected data from Wiki Art from and Art UK. Actually, that's a bit makes that as such that - from the 15th to the 20, almost 21st century - basically, it's a bias you can observe in a lot of paintings. And another nice thing is, it's actually a bias that becomes also stronger over time. So, you can see just the frequency how much eccentric, how much more space you’re putting in front, rather than behind your character, you're starting to have over time. So again, that's it for like one example. MG (14m 51s):I wonder if that's related to, you know - I used to do dinosaur field work, and in Wyoming, occasionally as we're driving out to the dig site - this is a kind of a lark - but we would find these pronghorn antelope, but they would never run in front of the car! They would race field vehicles, but they would never get in front of us because presumably, this sort of questionable evo-psych hypothesis about this was, that they're used to being chased by American lions and cheetahs in their evolutionary history. And so, they didn't like having something behind them, but they liked outracing something! And I wonder if something similar is at play in the notion that we visually prefer there being space in front of the subject, because like, the notion of like standing with your face to the wall is aesthetically unpleasant to us. HM (15m 43s):There's a bunch of reasons that have been advanced - In the way we wrote the paper, we're pretty agnostic on what is the good reason; or just like, there's a bunch of evidences and hypothesis that have been proposed by people in the literature - we're not taking a side on it. Part of it is, actually being able to parse out what is the interior and posterior side of an agent - is very useful to predict its action. And that’s something you can find in a lot of animals, actually. So, you know, not even related to them being a prey or not, that's kind of independent of being chased - but you would still need to know, what is the most likely direction of movement for most of the other agents you’re going to encounter in your environment.So that's one. Related to that, is the idea that it's better fraction anticipation. If you actually have more space in front of the agent, because this is where you would assume they might move - and kind of the last line was about gaze following. Because humans are particularly good and interested in following the gaze of other people. So, if you want to follow the gaze of a human that is depicted in profile, it means you would need to have more space in front of them. MG (16m 51s):Interesting. Yeah. There's so much there on also like, what makes a particular piece of cultural media popular, right? It's like the gaze following that. HM (17m 1s):It's like in that case, you have several factors that would all play in the same direction.  That's pretty nice because you don't have anything that would contradict or like, push in the other direction. Although, one factor that at least for some of the history of it played a role, was conventions for centering agents in portraits, which made sense. And one of the things we have evidence for is that, whenever you get this norm to be relaxed, your agents start to slide off. And so, you get this centering effect that increases. So, you can kind of counteract those natural, or just psychological, biases with explicit cultural norms. But if for some reason, your norm just weakens, then you're going to get more strength on the psychological bias side. MG (17m 51s):Awesome. So, to come back to the drumming paper! HM (17m 54s):Sorry, that was a big parenthesis! MG (17m 55s):No, no, no, no. We love non-linear tangential conversations here! At least, I think we do. And no one has told me otherwise yet!  So, again, this is a paper that's built on a really interesting, robust literature on cultural divergence and convergence, and musical production. And you talk in this paper about prior research that's [revealed existence of statistical universals]? I think a lot of people are familiar with the notion that people can recognize certain kinds of music like lullabies across cultural lines. So like, what else are you standing on for this study, and how are you trying to differentiate this particular piece of research from what's already been established? HM (18m 38s):I think one of the main differences - a lot of the previous studies are actually kind of from out “in the wild”, the data; this is an experimental study, which is actually fairly unusual for me. I am, I tend to be, also like large cultural data sets. So that's the first thing - like the approach and the methods we use are pretty different. There was another experiment that used the same methodology to get to universal characteristics as well, but that's not what we wanted to do. We wanted to try to have, actually, kind of different traditions within the lab. So we had a between-subject-with-different-conditions paradigm, and yeah, that design just allowed us to put different constraints on those different conditions.You can just see them evolve in different directions. So that was one of the main things. The other thing is, in terms of experiments, usually people start with very complicated things that [they have] their participants to reproduce. We started with the simplest thing we could think of, which is basically a metronome. So, that has also implications in terms of which direction you predict your movement to go. MG (19m 45s):So, getting into the meat here, after a lovely appetizer, this is a really interesting and clever experimental design. And I think it has a lot of implications for, you know, anybody listening who is thinking about the design of environments, or of like, software interfaces. And maybe that's getting a little ahead of things, but I would love for you to talk about how you actually structured this experiment, and then the hypotheses that you intended to test with it. HM (20m 16s):Do you have an example of what kind of answer you're expecting? Cause that's like a very broad! MG (20m 21s):Yeah. So, this is a study about laying a drum set out in different ways. And so like, you know, it's interesting - I mean, just from my years in, in music, there is remarkable convergence and universality in the like rock and roll drum kit, you know, but since the advent of highly modular and customizable midi setups, you’re seeing massive personalization of people's interfaces for musical control. And it seems like this is an in-the-wild example of how you were setting up this experiment - and it's the hypothesis that you confirmed, about how setting up a tool kit environment changes. MG (21m 9s):The affordances change the options that we have, and then changes the way that we navigate those; and the kind of cultural products that result from that. So like, what were you hoping to find out from this experiment? And then how did you set this up in a way with your test subjects to produce the results that tested that? HM (21m 30s):The first thing is, we actually have the same physical setup for all participants. What changes is, how are we asking them to use it? And so, it's not exactly the same, but it's totally true that it changes which affordances they have, and what is going to be easier to produce. I think in terms of “out in the wild” things, there's something even simpler about music, but the way guitars can be tuned is also one thing that makes some melodies much easier to play than others. So, I think it's, it might have been kind of much older traditions in music making, to arrange instruments in a way that is actually making whatever you want to produce easier.I don't know if you want predictions for instance, but I guess what this kind of things would predict is that people are first probably going to set up in a way that makes it easier for them to produce what they want to. But that might also mean it's going to be harder to produce other types of productions that are not the ones they had in mind when they figured out this setup. MG (22m 38s):There's a piece of this that's about where the complexity and musical patterns is coming from, here, that I think is really interesting. And I'd love to hear you speak to that. HM (22m 50s):Part of the previous studies tended to focus on an increasing complexity; but measured as, from moving from a random kind of sequence, to one that is more ordered - which, you know, depending on which version you have, of how to measure complexity - it might actually, it won't be an increase because for instance, for description length, it's going to be actually a decrease. If you get something that is ordered, it's easier to describe than something that is fully random. So we actually wanted to show that if you have this kind of mismatch between the physical setup, or your affordances and the very simple reason, you're going to be pushed in this region where the rhythm that is easier to produce is also going to be a more complex one. And I think maybe I should precise something about, the whole experiment was really thought of as a proof-of-concept, and can we obtain those kinds of effects?  So, that's definitely one of the effects we just wanted to prove is actually possible - that if you're stuck in a kind of suboptimal level of complexity, you might be pushed towards more complex versions. MG (24m 2s):So basically, the setup is the same. The layout is the same, but you're manipulating the order in which the drums have to be hit. So, people are having to move more or less in order to play the same pattern. HM (24m 16s):Yes. So, they're all start having to do the same pattern, that is this metronome. And then we have four different conditions. In two conditions they are, I think, only one type of distance to cover between pads. And it can be either small for the one of the condition, or large for the other one. And the large distance is basically twice as large as the small one. And then we have two - what we call the unequal movements conditions - which are a mix of those two types of distances. So, it would be either covering like a small distance, another small distance, then a large distance; or the other way round, starting with the largest distances, and then having small, small distances. MG (24m 55s):And so, there are five hypotheses that you test in this paper - and this is really cool, I thought, because this really shows just how careful and granular you are as a researcher, and how delicately you manage to differentiate between all of these different effects. So, could you get into the weeds here with me on that? HM (25m 20s):Sure, sure.  Part of the reason we have a pretty detailed hypothesis is, all of the study was pre-registered - and that's something I do on pretty much every study I lead.  It means you're going to have some kind of record of what were your hypothesis, methods, and analysis plan, before running the study.It usually is considered to be a good way to avoid [having] people just kind of “bricolaging” their results. And I think it was a pretty good exercise here, to figure out what kind of effects we wanted to observe exactly, and what we were predicting. One of the reasons we just have so many hypotheses, is because there are hypotheses that pertain to comparison between two of the conditions, and hypotheses that are more general.I'm not sure in which order that I put this on the paper anymore. One is, this general divergence between conditions.  Because you have those kinds of different physical constraints in each condition, we predict that over this passing of generation, they're basically going to go into different possible rhythms. So that's one; and then there's kind of more nitty-gritty ones about, what are going to be the specific adjustments you’re going to find in each condition?  One is that, the two conditions that have equal movements are still going to be able to remain around this kind of metronome-like rhythm. Whereas, the ones that have unequal movements are going to move into different types of rhythm, but they're going to not be those kinds of [?] of regular beat anymore.And then you have like, specific, between the two equal movements. So, if you're doing just small movements, we were predicting what is called the inter-onset interval.  That's that, the time between two beats was going to be smaller than if you have to do only large movements to reflect, again, what are those physical constraints for the two unequal movement conditions. Because you have this one distance that is larger to cover than the two others, and it's not in the same place in the two conditions, we were predicting that you would get this larger inter-onset interval at different points in the sequence they were asked to repeat.And the last thing is actually, that's just something that people would usually predict about most of those transmission chain experiments - that people would become, just make less mistake in coping rhythm, because the rhythm they are copying should be more adjusted to the constraints that they were in. MG (27m 50s):And that's the one that caught you off guard, right? HM (27m 54s):Yes. That's the one that didn't work out. Yeah. That was slightly surprising. So what we assume, or what's our hypothesis we cannot really test, is that we might have just been at a, some kind of threshold, of how bad people are at coping that - because we were using naive participants, so it might just be that they cannot get any better at that. MG (28m 18s):Which actually, that's a good loop out to talk about how you recruited people for this. And you know, you had a kind of an interesting anecdote about that recruiting - I am totally leading you into this, but yeah, like how did you find the people for this, and what kind of people were you using in this study? HM (28m 41s):Our criteria for recruiting people, we wanted them to be right-handed, because we need them to have at least that part of constraint - similar and not varying - whether you were going to use your right or left. And we recruited them mostly through the system we had with the joint-action lab, because we had that database, it turned out. We didn't manage to find enough participants in that database, so I ended up recruiting people off Reddit.  You do what you have to do to finish your PhD!  So, we asked all of them to have no experience in music - just ask to not have any formal training, or having played an instrument.And yeah, we've managed to find 120 of those people. MG (29m 29s):I'm sure there are more of them out there. HM (29m 31s):I hope so. MG (29m 33s):So, you know, again, I am one of these people that errs on the side of consilience - and I read a paper like this, and to me it sounds a lot like when you think about the way that certain errors seem more likely, because of the distance between two genes, and like the way that copying errors happen as stuff gets shuffled around on chromosomes that - this is not necessarily, and again, this, this sort of gets to that question of like - where you draw the line with so-called ecological constraints. Because some of them might be actually like, inside the organism, right? Like [what] are usually [called] multi-scale systems.And so I'm curious - just kind of more speculative question - what links you think there might be - or what insights do you think this suggests - in terms of, how cultural evolution is related to biological evolution, and how that is linked to like, for example - I think I sent you the totally surreal and terrifying, I think it was in Popular Science - article about convergent evolution and crabs; and how like, different groups of crustaceans keep evolving into crabs! And it's like this, you know, this thing about, they're just sort of easier pathways through the evolutionary landscape.I don't know. What are your thoughts on all of that? HM (30m 60s):One thing about this distinction between ecological, and what's inside or outside the organism - maybe that's a funny side note - but, we actually had pretty vivid debate between the co-authors of this paper; because, you still do need a mind to perceive the environment, and the environment is always mediated through your body and your cognition still -- So, that's something we haven't really solved. I'm not gonna lie - We just went with what is making the point come across easiest! So, that might not be a very good answer. I just have to say, I'm not a biologist by training. So, I would tend to refrain from having very strong opinions on how it works for genetic evolution - but there's definitely convergent evolution both for biology and culture. MG (31m 48s):And then sort of relatedly, there's this question of divergence and the emergence of new complexity, right? And so, the sort of path-dependent histories of different lineages, and gets to the heart of one of the most - what is a core question in both studies - of biological evolution, and cultural evolution; which is - Where does all of this diversity come from? What are the constraints that lead to more complexity in an organism, or in a civilization over time? So, I mean, maybe you might have the same answer to that question as you did the last one, but… HM (32m 26s):Yeah. I mean, that's a very broad question! So, there's a bunch of links for sure. Yea, I think it's mostly, you have very different constraints and problems between biological and cultural systems. And one of the things is for culture, is actually much harder to maintain stable types because the mutation rates you have are like, very different from the ones who get in biological systems. So, in terms of, you know, more complexity science kind of concepts - that that would mean you would kind of get into error catastrophe pretty quickly.  The kind of enigma for culture is more, How do we maintain stability? Whereas I guess for biology, you have a bunch of mechanisms that we know are able to maintain stability, because DNA transmission is pretty faithful. It's just like not even the same order of magnitude, in terms of errors you get in cultural systems. MG (33m 17s):That said, I think this is the right time to give a shout out to, I think it was episode 17 that we had with Chris Kempes, because he and I talked in that episode about his research into copying times for genetic information in cells as they scale; and how you get the advent of multicellularity is like a response to the threat of an error catastrophe, as the amount of DNA required to regulate the contents of the cell gets bigger and bigger, as the cell is growing. And then, you get to a point where it actually makes more sense to have a multicellular organism. And so again - like I think about this in terms of one of the caveats that you give in this paper - is that, most musical production in human beings is in groups now.And I wonder if again - I'm being totally irresponsible here! - but I wonder if this kind of divergence and increase in complexity that you're seeing in this study, is like watching the beginning of an evolutionary transition into collective musical-like practice and performance. Like, you're watching the length of the code start to grow, until like eventually you just need a form a band. HM (34m 38s):I like the idea of that. I think people who were, you know, much more involved in debates on what are the evolutionary origins of music, have other hypothesis as on, why music making is often happening in groups. And then, even if those people tend to disagree, mostly it's like either because music is a good signal of your ability to coordinate within groups; so, it would have emerged in the context of inter-group warfare; or, because it's simply a good way to bond with other people. So, you have those kinds of other hypothesis, on why you would get music-making in two up, and in groups, more than alone. MG (35m 14s):So, where else do you see examples of this kind of dynamic and action in cultural evolution, where ecological factors lead to different stable cultural items from the same seed? HM (35m 29s):I'm not sure in the real world, [that] it happens exactly from the same seed, like that. That's the part where, you know, that's kind of an artifact of having done that in the lab; then you get this kind of path-dependency in the real world that you just talked about.  One domain where you're very likely to observe it - is cooking - because your availability of raw products is very different, depending on which environment you're in. But there are other things just like availability of eating sources, that have impacted a lot of where cooking, and like eating your food, would happen. So, one of the places and ways it could occur is, if you have actually hot springs around - because you can just like put your food in some kind of [container] and use the hot spring, or whatever water is warm nearby, for you to cook your food.To some extent. MG (36m 22s):Another example would be the availability of different spices, right? HM (36m 27s):The kind of ingredients you have is also going to impact which kind of food you're going to be able to prepare. And I guess there might have been also major shifts with foods, and staples being introduced, in different places. MG (36m 39s):So, no offense to my ancestors, but this has to do with the notoriously bland English cuisine, you know - just it's like it's too far to reach! That explains kind of why they went to such an effort to establish transoceanic trade routes. Right?!  Anyway, we're getting way off the subject. [Laughter] HM (36m 58s):There is a Lovely book called Consider The Fork, about different, just like, the story of cooking and cooking instruments; and the author, at some point argues that British food was probably not as bland as it looks, because it was cooked in much smaller pots. So, it was actually not as over-cooked as the timing on the recipes look like, if that's any consolation! [Laughter] MG (37m 26s):That’s sort of an origins-of-life thing, you know - with the hot springs hypothesis, you know - collecting organic molecules, rather than … anyway! HM (37m 34s):[Laughter] So you're going to have to edit this part!… but I grew up learning to drink wine, like South France wine, and like, very specific species. And that definitely has a major impact on which wines I appreciate now still! And wine is probably also one of the kind of domains, where you have very strong dependence on what your final product is based on; what is the species of grape you have. MG:What is it they say? The smaller, the berry, the richer, the juice - or something like that? It's like, the small dogs seem to have as many neuro-transmitters as the big dogs!… HM (38m 12s):I don't know. [laughter] MG (38m 16s):That’s okay… so, there's a very low-activation energy transition that I want to make here - into this other pre-print for Current Anthropology, that I was really excited to read about. Also, the predictable evolution of letter shapes and “Emergent script of West Africa recapitulates historical change in writing systems” - Piers Kelly is the lead author; James Winters, who fans of cultural evolution study will probably recognize as a big name; and then Olivier Morin. So, this paper feels like a natural transition - just because we're talking about the same kind of processes at play; but, about the evolution of writing systems over time.Can you take us on a little tour of the history of the thinking about the evolution of writing systems? You know, actually, I highly recommend people read this, because this is a very rich and detailed piece of the paper - but just a 30,000 foot overview would be great! HM (39m 22s):I should start though just by, I liked it because this was a really dream-team to work in; and I think it's probably also what makes the paper that great.  Piers Kelly is a linguist and anthropologist, and is probably one of the most knowledgeable people about the Vai script of Liberia , which is the one we were studying in this paper. Olivier Morin already worked a bunch on what kind of shape writing systems take. So, in terms of factors of attraction - we were talking before, in like ecological versus psychological - it is an amazing work at showing that you get cognitive factors about, what kind of shape characteristic; and mostly, that have cardinal or oblique orientation, in terms of strokes, a lot more than you would predict just by chance.And that's one of the way it's really tuned to our visual system. And James Winters is mostly linguistic evolution, and cultural evolution in general. And actually, the methods we used in that paper are methods I first used on my paper on the graphic complexity of motifs in heraldry. So that's all the kind of influences that went into that paper, you know, as a start. Now, back to - what our kind of hypothesis about the evolution of writing?  There's a lot of writing scholars that I've suggested, that you get this kind of almost natural history of writing, that comes from first having very complicated signs that look almost drawing-like; and having them progressively simplify. And he would also have this kind of transition from pictorial systems, to things that are more, with smaller linguistic units. MG (41m 10s):The example that most people would probably be familiar with is Egyptian hieroglyphics, right? Going from this, is an image to like, the hieratic script, which is on its way to just becoming phonemic letters. Right?  So it's like, symbol, to grapheme, to phoneme? HM (41m 30s):Yes, I think it also has this kind of interesting, almost sociology of science thing, where it's a hypothesis that I think the paper is usually cited for - it is from [Ignace] Gelb I think, 1960s. And I think a lot of people worked on kind of, more localized system, would disagree with it. But for some reason, this disciple still has some kind of a ground. So there's that, and there's a bunch of work that are more on the experimental side from linguistic evolution, where if you ask people to do some kind of guessing Pictionary game in labs, you can also get those kind of simplification effects where, you know, they started doing something that looks a lot like a drawing, and they end up having things that looks a lot more like symbols.And you can also get those kinds of simplification. If you ask them to reproduce a character from memory, like you get differences. So, if you're asking them to reproduce them with the model in front of them, you can maintain pretty complex kind of scribbles if you do that. But ask them to reproduce them from memory, they're going to simplify a lot more and that's work from the Center for Language Evolution in Edinburgh.  That's actually where James Winters did his PhD. MG (42m 44s):Cool. So you make a really important distinction in this paper - and that's the distinction between simplification and compression. And I think that this really gets at - to spoiler alert this - this gets at, I think a much bigger issue about - I am constantly talking about physicist Mark Buchanan's 2018 Nature Physics editorial - on a bias for simplicity in physical theories. And I know that you work with Simon DeDeo; and Simon has recently done some really interesting work on the sort of, guiding like, Occam's Razor, and like, consilience; and this trend, that's not a consistent trend.But it's interesting to note the contexts in which we move toward simpler, more unifying theories in science - or we look for this is sort of like - the ghost haunting this entire conversation - which is, When is it important to make a distinction? And when is it okay to bundle things together?  In taxonomy, you've got “lumpers” and “splitters.” And so, this research gets at this question of languages. When are they getting too simple? When do the letters start to blur together?  So I guess I would love to hear you talk a little bit about what you mean specifically, by talking about compression versus simplification. And then, what are the constraints that you are suggesting in this paper, about when a visual writing is going to get simpler over time; or why it's getting simpler? Like, when does it stop getting simpler? When does it have to start becoming more complex again? You know, when does it become - when does it all go crabs?! - and then, you know - When do we have to assign some different roles to the basketball team? HM (44m 43s):I think maybe we need to start with, What do communication system do first?  Because we need to get from, What are the kinds of constraints that operate on those cultural items, before answering all of those questions. And one of the first things is, a writing system is really a set of written symbols of characters that codes for a set of meanings. So, simplification can occur in different ways:  You could just lose characters and meanings, together. And it just means you have less complex stuff -- Compression means you're still managing to communicate the same amount of information, but with simpler symbols, usually. And that's the way we use it in this paper. MG (45m 26s):You mentioned the techniques by which you actually measured the complexity - so I guess first of all, you mentioned that you had developed some of these techniques on an earlier paper, that we'll also link to in the show notes, on heraldry, which is really cool; but I would love to hear you talk about like -because this is something that comes up, for example, in the Facebook group all the time - which is, people arguing about these different measures of complexity - and this is a bigger kind of argument surrounding complex systems research, in general - but you came up with a really finely-specified and concrete-actionable set of measures for how you standardized your data set, and then operated on it. And I think that was really cool. And then, talk about the data set too - because the language that you studied for this, is fascinating. HM (46m 17s):The language is this Vai script of Liberia; it was invented early 19th century. And what's interesting is, you don't get that many independent inventions of writing. So, it's not exactly independent, because part of the group that invented it had been exposed to writing in other forms.  It's those kinds of almost de novo creation of writing. And there's hardly a dozen of those that happened; and so that was why [it] was partly interesting, and it's also one that is really well-informed.  It's well informed also, because purists did a great job at kind of tracking all the people who had done inventories of the signs and sounds that we’re using in it.So in that case, we had that, I think was in 1834, if I'm not wrong. And the last one is 2005 from Unicode. And we have, that appoints this kind of census of the characters in the script almost every 10 years - in between like 10 to 15 years, I think - we had like 16 time points, or something around that. MG (47m 31s):So, it's like geologists getting to watch an island form! HM (47m 36s):It's a bit like that - it’s really rare data - it’s a really amazing data set for sure! MG (47m 42s):Then talk about how you actually standardized - and then the measures; because there's two different measures of complexity that you're studying here.  I think those are both really interesting, because that spills out into a conversation I had with Geoffrey West about fractals and the history of complex systems, and how you actually measure coastlines, and all that kind of stuff. Again, I’ve got to stop this!  But yeah, there’s really, really interesting methodology here, I'd love to hear. HM (48m 15s):We actually mostly borrowed it from this transmission chain of symbols that [Simon] Kirby & [Monica] Tamariz did. And there are two types of measures we're using.  One is called, I think usually, algorithmic.  It’s really just taking your picture, compressing it as much as you can, and see what is the size it still has on your hard drive.  It's kind of, a bit agnostic one to some extent.  The second one is called parametric, and it's a ratio of what is your in-surface, divided by what are your parameters around it; and it was used in psychophysics experiments. So, we know it's actually a good proxy for how hard it is to remember, and kind of learn, characters.That's one of the nice things, actually, even the algorithmic types of measures, seem to correlate to some extent with human performance - At some point, I went down the rabbit hole of looking at ergonomics studies that happened 2000’s, about - So, that's where we kind of know that usually, more complex symbols are going to be harder to recognize and to learn.  That's one of the constraints you get, that should drive those kinds of simplification of character or compression of the script. MG (49m 29s):So, to draw that line to ergonomics, it's like, why you don't have any pretzel chairs, right?! Like, the amount of time it takes to get in and out of a chair determines how likely that chair is to exist! HM (49m 41s):I'm not sure! So like, in terms of ergonomics, I was thinking more about, kind of, cognitive or task-oriented performance. Not necessarily like physical. MG (49m 50s):Well, there's a link between this paper and the drumming paper in terms of keyboard layouts, right? And the convergence on a QWERTY keyboard kind of; it seems like it has a lot to do with the distance between keystrokes. HM (50m 6s):Keyboards are actually like those kinds of super path-dependence story where, you know, they were optimized from typewriters.  They were made so, I think it was just easier for, the mechanism of them to still work - so it actually minimizes, like, crossing of something in the machinery, in the first place. That's why they don't actually make a lot of sense for typing now! And fun fact, I have an SRT keyboard as a French person, not a QWERTY one. So, I'm pretty sure if I'm trying to type quick, I'm going to make different typos than you would on the QWERTY keyboard. That's this kind of, your material environments is going to change. MG (50m 43s):Because it was locked in, but I guess, it was originally a perimetric complexity. Right? Because you said, it's like the bars inside the typewriter. HM (50m 52s):Yeah, I think now the optimal would be like the Dvorak, probably. MG (50m 57s):Yeah, I had a friend who changed his keys out to the Dvorak. HM (50m 59s):One of my supervisors did. MG (51m 4s):So, what were the predictions that you tested in this study? HM (51m 8s):We wanted to test whether you find this general simplification of characters over time. And then we were interested in the what's like, Which characters in the distribution are actually going to change most?  So, our idea was, if you actually get a system to be more compressed; what is going to change is mostly, the more complex characters are going to become simpler, because they're just like, harder to process. So, you have constraints to get them to be simpler; but really simple characters wouldn't get any simpler. If they're, you know, already at this kind of optimal, between being able to distinguish and remember. MG (51m 45s):So that would mean that overall, between 1834 and 2005, when you're looking at the evolution of the Vai script, that it ends up kind of becoming more homogeneous, right? Like in the complexity of different letters. HM (52m 2s):Yeah, that's the consequence if you get only your more complex letters to become simpler, but your simple letters kind of stay at the same level. It means you're just gonna be, have less variation, in terms of how complex your characters are. So, it gets more homogeneous. MG (52m 18s):I think again - like I kind of jokingly alluded to this, with the imaginal crab scape - but you know, when we had Jennifer Dunne on the show, in episodes 5 and 6, talking about trophic networks, one of the most interesting things about her work is, how conserved those food webs are in completely different ecosystems, across like, hundreds of millions of years. And you know, it really suggests that the niches have been established; that when you have an ecological collapse, like a mass extinction, then there's a moment. And we talked about this in the Transmission series; also in Episode 29, about how like, mutation rates go up after a mass extinction, and things, you know, radiate to fill the lost niches.So this kind of work suggests something similar, which is that the amount of changes - the degree that you see a visual language changing and complexity over time - has to do with the number of characters involved, and like, how much differentiation there has to be between those things, in order to be recognized as distinct characters. And do you think that this is a fair analogy that like, basically for the same reasons, or for similar reasons to like, an evolutionary radiation in a collapsed food web? - you know; that there are, in a really thick, dense language - like Chinese written language, where you've got like hundreds and hundreds of characters - There's less room to move? HM (53m 57s):I actually have some work, but like not out yet, on that - You're going to need to invite me again, like mad! and then scannable like and say - but yeah, you definitely get some kind of pressure from distinctiveness; actually in another case study we did. And, we actually also did it with Olivier Morin, about distinctiveness in - is also on the heraldry. And we did this kind of model to show that people kind of, apparently, try to maximize distinctiveness, in terms of which combination of features they put on their coat of arms.  You kind of get those frequencies of each type of coats of arms that are more based on the frequencies of their elements, than by copying them. MG (54m 44s):Heraldry is a really interesting example. And, and here I'm stepping completely off the cliff into something I know nothing about, but like - you know, because it's a symbol made of other symbols, then it sort of seems like it loops us back to questions around the evolution of syntax, and how you are able to generate distinctive sentences, rather than having to remember a bunch of unique components, right? A complex family crest seems a whole lot easier to assemble than a completely unique letter, you know, that’s supposed to represent your house - right? HM (55m 26s):To be fair, what we did was using fairly simple coats of arms only! So yeah, a word that I said was basically, pretty much all coats of arms that could be kind of coded down as, one color, another color, and one motif or, you know, type of shape. So, it doesn't say much about like, very complex ones. MG (55m 47s):So, all three of your hypotheses were confirmed by this study. Did anything about your results surprise you? HM (55m 55s):Well mostly, how well it worked - I think that that's something that people forget, but as a scientist, are also very surprised when things work! I actually, yeah, you probably picked the two papers I have worked, predictions are the most well confirmed!  So yeah - I know, the portraits too - but otherwise, usually things don't really work that well!  So yeah, I think we're, weren't too surprised. We're just like, this is really a beautiful example, and we're really happy with it. MG (56m 24s):Just out of a commitment to thoroughness here, this paper has towards the end of it, a really intricate section on the context in which these symbols could end up being compressed. And it was really interesting, just to rattle them off - and then give you the opportunity to go deeper on this stuff - You differentiate between the possibility that compression is a solution to a coordination problem, or the process of institutional standardization; or, that it has something to do with the movement of language from one medium into another medium. And I'd just be really curious to hear you give a little more detail on that, and then how you and your co-authors were able to distinguish between the effects of those different possible causes; and where you see them explaining, or not explaining, the results that you got. HM (57m 22s):That's like all possible explanations, but I think that's kind of the tricky part. Like, you really need so fine-grained data on a lot of things, if you want to be able to like parse all of those out. MG (57m 37s):So, I mean - given everything we've discussed today, What are some take-home insights that you feel that you can offer people, in terms of actually living in-the-mix of cultural evolution? And I know a lot of people are concerned in this time with the, you know, the collapse of civilization. What does your research suggest about the interplay of all of these factors? I think about people that are at work on archival or cultural preservation projects -- I think about people that are interested in pioneering new modes of linguistic communication, to try to match the complexity of our evolving media landscape.And what advice, if any, do you have for people that are looking to sort of play with these forces, and actually act upon cultural evolution in meaningful ways? HM (58m 36s):I think one first thing - which is kind of more a property of culture I tend to using the way I work - is this idea that sometimes cultural practices almost go kind of out of equilibrium, or like in kind of places that are not necessarily optimal, to match the different technological or psychological factors. And it's kind of a property of it and of this, you know - [the] idea that culture operates mostly through those directed types of transformation that, with each passing generation, it kind of means it's going to get back to something that is more optimal, if it doesn't feel like it is optimal right now.  I think it's a pretty optimistic - or at least kind of a bit heads off away - to see how our culture evolves.I think it was, if it's a dynamical system that has those kinds of preferred rate; like parts of the landscape - it would ultimately move back to, yeah; it's kind of double-edged, because you can also think it's meaning, we’re doomed as well - because here, we cannot do much about it. Yeah. I think it's also just a good method or way to see the world, to try to put aside what are different factors in those cultural phenomena, especially when they feel a bit overwhelming. I mean, at least for me, I know usually understanding things makes me much calmer by them!  So, I guess that's probably more my kind of take-home is, like just trying to understand, is usually helpful. MG (1h 0m 1s):I keep hoping that we have fewer messaging apps. That would be a beautiful instance of collapse, like that the letters are too similar to one another, right?! HM (1h 0m 12s):But I mean, it also has this implication of usually you're going to get what you need out of culture. Like if you have those kinds of niche for one function, you're going to have something fulfilling it. So ultimately, you know, it looks like it's not actually happening now. It's going to happen at some other point. MG (1h 0m 30s):I guess there's money for all of those startups. So, something is feeding all of those crabs! Well, okay. I want to thank you so much for taking the time with this and thank you so much for co-authoring such interesting research and for being so patient in this conversation. HM (1h 0m 49s):It's my pleasure. Really. MG (1h 0m 50s):Anything else that you want to offer people before we bounce? Anything you want to point people to beyond your Google scholar page and your Twitter account, which people should be following. And if you're not, I’ll find you…! HM (1h 1m 3s):Apart from that, not really. Yeah. Just feel free to read any of my papers. Like, I mean, right now, I'm also pretty free to come to lab meetings to talk about any of them. So, feel free to reach out in any case! MG (1h 1m 16s):Awesome. Thanks a lot!
46,Episode Details / Transcript Machine transcript by podscribe.ai, edited with the help of Danielle Johnson and Caroline Siegel. (Time code starts at beginning of conversation, not of episode.)Michael (0s):All right. Well, Scott Ortman, it is a pleasure to have you on Complexity Podcast. Thanks for joining us.Scott (6s):Thank you.Michael (7s):So I like to start these, because a big part of the show, at least for me, is humanizing the researchers, humanizing the process of science. So I like to start these with a little bit of a biographical background and just ask you how you got into the work that you're doing?  What drew you into archaeology in the first place?  And then from there, what, most likely nonlinear path, took you into the orbit of the Santa Fe Institute?Scott (37s):Sure. Why did I become an archaeologist? Honestly, I think it was because when I was a freshman in college, the first archaeology course I took as an undergraduate, had a lot of inquiry to it. And what I mean by that is when I was younger, I was very good at math and I liked biology and things like that, and I always assumed that I would go into one of those fields when I grew up. And the first few years of college, I took a year of chemistry, a year of physics, a year of biology, and it was like class after class was “Here's everything that we know, learn it.” And all I can say is that the way it was taught for me, I mean, I could do it, but it wasn't super exciting because, I know of course in all of those fields inquiry is crucial once you get into it and once you get to the point that you can do that sort of thing, but the way it was presented made it feel like you're never going to get there because there's just a bunch of rote learning to do and you get tested on your ability to memorize things, as opposed to your ability to actually be a researcher.  In contrast, my first archaeology course, I guess it was my sophomore year in college, the very first assignment was getting data from excavations and being asked to examine it, and analyze it, make sense of it, figure it out. And that was just way more fun, frankly.  And I think if my first physics course had been fun like that, I'd probably be a physicist now or if my first biology course had been like that, I'd be a biologist now, but for whatever reason, I just got started down this path because of the way it was presented to me when I was 19 years old.Scott (2m 16s):How did I get to SFI? Well, I was an Omidyar Postdoctoral Fellow at SFI, was very fortunate enough to be offered one of those position at the Institute after I completed my PhD back in 2010. And I would say that when I applied for the fellowship, I wouldn't say I knew that much about complexity science per se, my training certainly was not in that. When I went and got a master's degree and PhD in archaeology, I learned the ideas and methods of that discipline. I've always been interested in interdisciplinary work, back when I was a graduate student, I read a lot of cognitive science and cognitive linguistics. I was interested in human biology and human evolution, population biology, and I applied a lot of those kinds of ideas and methods in my dissertation work. So I was very comfortable with and excited about the idea of interdisciplinary research or research on questions kind of at the margins between disciplines.  Or questions, where as much as practitioners of any given discipline might wish it were different, you can't answer them with a disciplinary approach. So I knew that SFI was the place to go to do kind of interdisciplinary work or work between disciplines. And that was really the reason I applied and why I was super excited and honored to be offered a fellowship there. So the work that I do related to complexity science in human societies is interests and knowledge that developed once I joined the SFI community, it's definitely not a part of my previous life.Michael (4m 5s):Yeah. So as someone who fell out of the ambit of paleontology after my undergrad, and then over the subsequent 15 years has seen a complete sea change in the methodological toolkit being used in that discipline, it seems like something very similar has gone on in archaeology, and that brings us to the first piece that I want to discuss with you, which touches on the issues you just described here. It was an opinion piece that you wrote for PNAS, along with a host of coauthors, including Jerry Sabloff and Tim Kohler of SFI, and numerous others on: Fostering synthesis in archaeology to advance science and benefit society.And, I feel like this is a really important subject to clarify for people just how different, at least of the archaeology that you practice, is from the public opinion, the public image that has developed as a consequence of films like Indiana Jones, and just this notion that archaeology is sort of a sophisticated stamp collection or that it's about grave robbing or this kind of thing. And that actually, you're working in very intricate ways with people in a number of different fields. And you're applying a suite of techniques and methods that are not merely acquisitive and are really getting at something that is more fundamental about the dynamics of human society and the way that those dynamics are embedded in the sort of the broader, fundamental understanding about the physical nature of the world.And so, I would love to hear you talk a little bit about this opinion piece and the organizations that you're a part of that you mentioned in this piece and why you and your colleagues felt that these organizations needed to happen, what kind of service they’re functioning in society.Scott (6m 10s):Yeah. And that opinion piece is emanated from a workshop that a large group of us attended and an organization that developed from that called the Coalition for Archeological Synthesis. And the basic idea of that is that the ability of archaeologists to document the physical remains of past behavior through archaeology has been expanding exponentially in the last few decades. Just to give you an example, a few years ago, the US Geological Survey did a LIDAR survey of all of Northern New Mexico where my field work is, and as a result there's freely available LIDAR data that you can download for my entire research area, and you can basically make absolutely accurate maps of archeological sites.  Things that used to take a field season and weeks to do, you can do in a day using your computer. It's really astonishing the ability of the tools that we have to make those observations. So, archaeology is getting so much better and so much faster and so much more efficient in collecting observations about the archeological record. And we're getting a lot better at translating those observations into proxies for things that are interesting about past behavior and things that are interesting to learn about.At the same time, I think the traditional idea of the field is that its goal is to tell the story of the past. In other words, its purpose is largely humanistic in the sense of developing the story of societies of the past, the rise and fall of civilizations, the, the historical development of different societies around the world. And don't get me wrong, the public wants that from archaeologists and archaeologists like doing it, and they're good at it, and they're creative, and many of the stories that archaeologist develop are very exciting and interesting to think about. They feed our imaginations in important ways. They help us to imagine alternative worlds and alternative ways of living that I think all of us could use in these days to help us creatively imagine ways of solving the problems that we face.  But the many of us involved with the coalition feel that the field of archaeology is not leveraging our ability to systematically observe the archeological record well enough.  And we're not giving back to society as much as I think we could. And so the focus of this organization is to promote a way of thinking about the archeological record that is very much in keeping with the way, in a sense, a transformation that happened in biology as the theory of evolution came to pass in the 19th century. So, prior to Darwin, natural history involved, documenting the diversity of life, the diversity, the fossil record, cataloging the geographical patterns of biological diversity and so forth.   And prior to Darwin, there wasn't a very clear sense that the processes that govern what happens in a living population right now might be the same as the processes that govern the evolution of species at the scale of the paleontological record, for example, the geological record. So a commitment to uniformitarianism, a commitment to the idea that there are certain fundamental processes that have been operating in the evolution of life all along, was a crucial step in developing an approach to biology that has been so incredibly productive and useful for humanity. The ability to know how evolution works is crucial right now, right?  For figuring out how to solve this pandemic that we're suffering through.  Without the theory of evolution, it's a heck of a lot harder to solve many of these kinds of problems.So the Coalition for Archeological Synthesis is trying to promote that way of thinking about the archeological record too, and about human societies.  The idea that there is a core set of uniformitarian social processes that operate in any society. And what that means is if you can identify what they are and learn how to study them, you can learn about the way those processes work today by studying the way they've worked in the past.  And that the things you would learn from studying the archeological record then become directly applicable to the way societies work today. That's the goal.  It's, of course, a huge culture change for archaeology and it's going to take a while to convince other social scientists about this way of thinking. But I think it's going to take archaeologists coming up with convincing examples of how this can be done.  Anyway, that's what we're working on and that's what I'm excited to be contributing to.Michael (11m 13s):Excellent. Yeah, I want to loop back into the uniformitarian picture here, but before we do, and I know this might be kind of dry for some people, but I think it's also important to understand the way that the practice, the organization, the structure of science is changing these days in order to reflect the increasingly networked nature of society itself. And you mentioned in this piece, that in collaboration with scientists and other disciplines, archaeologists need to conduct synthetic research that enjoys institutional and infrastructural support beyond what could be accomplished or is accomplished through grant funded initiatives that individual universities or research institutes, but how?  And then you point to a case study from the field of ecology grappling with similar problems coming to their own innovative solutions in the nineties.So what does that look like in terms of what it means to reach beyond these sort of more conventional modes of funding and organizing science in order to actually accomplish this research?Scott (12m 18s):So the traditional scope of a grant, let's say from the National Science Foundation to do an archeological project would be a couple of years for a couple of collaborators to spend several months in the field, either doing excavations or survey, to do some analysis of the samples that are recovered for, let's say, dating or chemistry or things like that. And the traditional way of collecting archeological data is at the travel's edge; you've got a digging implement and you're in the ground, and that's where the observations are coming from is the removal of the earth. Or more recently maybe, making a map of archeological remains somewhere. So that process works, but of course it takes a very long time to accumulate enough data working in that way to apprehend the evolution of entire societies in ways that are relevant for what we live through now.  In many ways, I would say the collection of data through remote sensing and satellite imagery and space age types of technologies is of a scope and scale that is much more in keeping with the ability of the archeological record to contribute to an understanding of today.But there's a culture change involved there where funding agencies still imagine what they're doing as: they're funding an excavation or they're funding an analysis of a museum collection or something like that. And again, I'm not saying that those things don't contribute to the total cumulative accumulation of knowledge in the field, it just means it's a very slow process when it's done that way. And it takes much longer than one project to do it that way. So one angle on solving this problem involves new forms of data collection, using satellites and imagery, I mentioned LIDAR coverage, things like that. Another dimension of it is that because archaeologists have been collecting data for a hundred years or more, there is a lot of information out there that's very distributed and non-standardized, and it's distributed in tons of publications and reports and archives and things like that. And the process of integrating all that information into the kinds of databases that we all know are so productive to work with today is a really big challenge. And it takes person power, it takes a person to actually go to an archive and get a piece of paper and actually type in the numbers in a record. You can't just go to a website and download the data to work with, you have to create it working in this distributed way. So that's also expensive and it takes a long time. So that's another one of the challenges that we have.  But I would say that the biggest challenge truly just has to do with archaeologists, imagining what we can do with the information we can potentially control, expanding our imagination regarding what we can do with it and the ways in which it can be helpful to the present and the future.I think, again, you see it even in the way, archaeologists write.  I read so many books where the goal is to understand something that someone is looking at: this excavation, this burial, this detail.  And if the goal is to understand the details, I mean human societies in detail, of course vary in all sorts of ways. It's sort of like if you wanted to study the details in the configuration of organelles in a cell from moment to moment, it'd be much more productive to generalize about patterns in what the organelles do as single celled organisms evolve or something like that, then it would be to try and understand the specific details of what happens inside a cell from moment to moment.  And I think that's true for societies too. I think the regularities that are there at the level of human social behavior show up when you apprehend them at a big scale and you don't need to sweat the details so much.  And the archeological record also, because only some things preserve and they don't preserve consistently, and what is preserved varies from place to place around the world.  The archeological record shows you different things at different places just depending on happenstance for what happens to preserve based partly on the environment and partly on the behavior of people in the past, and partly on what's happened since those ruins were vacated, and so on.  All those things are there and all of those things mean that an archaeology that contributes to the present and future really can't traffic in the details.  We need to step back to the big picture again, I would say a bird's eye view and a broad view, an evolutionary level view of entire societies to make our contributions. So, supporting research teams to work on those sorts of projects when they are so different from what archaeologists have traditionally done or what an archeological project is traditionally conceived of as being, is a huge challenge that we have to overcome.Michael (17m 36s):Yeah. Anyone who has spent some time listening to this show or reading the corpus of complex systems research knows that there is a strong vein of functionalism in this discipline, and you're really speaking to that.I want to talk with you about the way that adopting this functionalist attitude, or this lens, has allowed you to do some of the more interesting work, and at least in my opinion, that you've done, which is work you've coauthored with people like José Lobo and Luis Bettencourt and others on urban scaling and on how it is that you apply this kind of thinking to looking at this, like you said, rather heterogeneous set of different ancient settlements, urban and non-urban, over thousands of years, across thousands of kilometers all over the world, and then derive from that a uniform understanding of how human societies grow and what changes as they grow.We'll link to all of these in the show notes.  You've got papers at PLOS One, Journal of Archeological Science, and others, looking at settlements, scaling and economic change everywhere from central Mexico to the Andes, to the Roman Empire. And like you said, it seems like you had to look less at the historically contingent and culturally specific ways that these cities utilized space and more at the functions that those different spaces and relationships between them enabled different kinds of social activity. So this is a powerful example of how this kind of thinking reveals these sort of universals among human societies across time and space and I I'd love to hear you kind of unpack how you and your coauthors formalized this kind of thinking in this work.Scott (19m 37s):Well, the way that we got to start collaborating is a fun story.  Back when I was a post-doc at SFI, of course, one of the things that is wonderful to do there is to sit and have lunch and talk with whoever happens to be there and learn about what other people are doing and hear about their questions and get involved in conversations about those things. So I used to, when I was a postdoc, I would pretty regularly sit and have lunch with Luis Bettencourt and learn about the work that he was doing with Geoffrey West and others on urban scaling. And what struck me was the very beginnings of a formal approach to thinking about these effects was beginning to take shape at that time.And I remember Geoffrey and Luis, both talking about these ideas and explaining what they thought the fundamental social processes were that led to these effects that they were observing in contemporary cities. And so there were two elements of this. One was, as I learned about the kinds of data that urban scientists were using, working in the present, I thought, “Wow, they're thinking about societies like archaeologists do,”  in the sense that they're taking a big step back and thinking about them in very broad terms. And that's something that in the study of contemporary cities, has only become feasible in the relatively recent past as the technologies for observing contemporary, urban life, again from altitude, has come into being, so there's that dimension.And then there were the ideas about where the social processes that generated these scaling effects and where they came from, what they were and what was going on with them. And I remember listening to Luis and Geoffrey talking about it and what I realized is that they were not alluding to anything that was specifically contemporary or modern. They weren't alluding to capitalism. They weren't alluding to finance. They weren't alluding to democracy. They weren't alluding to markets, even. They were alluding to something very, very simple and very, very general, which was the concentration of human interactions of all kinds in space, in physical space, and the constraints of physical space for human interaction.Of course, the fact that a person can only talk to so many other people at once.  The fact that people have to eat in the end, we can't interact if we don't have energy in our bodies to burn, to power our brains. So when I heard Luis and Geoffrey talking about these ideas, I thought, well, if you're right, and this is what's going on with contemporary patterns of urban scaling, then they should show up throughout the archeological record too, because people in ancient societies did everything that they were talking about that people in cities today do. So I remember after one particular presentation that Geoffrey gave at SFI, I remembered that I had some settlement pattern data from ancient central Mexico on my computer that had been collected in the 1960s through a “old fashioned” survey archaeology, where people actually had to walk around and directly measure the boundaries of ancient settlements and things like that, estimate the population based on the densities of trash that were laying around on the surfaces of these sites and so on.And so I, I found those data on my computer and I analyzed them the same way that I had seen Luis and Geoffrey look at data for contemporary cities.  And lo and behold the same statistical patterns were there, all the way down to the same parameters of the fit lines were there.  And I have to admit, I remember when I was first interviewing for an Omidyar Fellowship, I remember having an interview with Geoffrey and it was the first time I'd heard him talk about the urban scaling work that the team at SFI have been doing, and because of my training as an anthropologist, my first reaction was to be more interested in why cities don't fall on the line then the fact that the line was there. I was just coming out of an anthropology graduate program where diversity is the point of everything that anthropologists do. And so my first reaction to it was like, “Well, understanding the residuals to the fit line is more interesting than the fit line.”  And it took me a while, probably more of most of a year of listening to Geoffrey and Luis and others talk about how astounding it was that the fit line was there. And I would say that I finally understood that when I analyzed the data that I had on my computer from central Mexico and got the same parameter value for the fit line, then I thought, “Oh, okay, this is cool. This is interesting.”   And that started us off on this trajectory that's led to grant funding and a website and conferences and lots of publications, and as you said, I hope a good example of how the way of thinking represented by the Coalition for Archeological Synthesis can work. I certainly hope that this work will be perceived in that way by other archaeologists, at least, and hopefully other social scientists too. So we've been running with it ever since, and again, what's become, I think, apparent to all of us in ways that we didn't realize before is that the ideas embedded in the tradition of urban scaling research at SFI are really not even about cities. They're not about the present. They're not about cities.  They're about human beings and what they do. And they're about human sociality in general. And as a result, I feel like we're actually working on a much more general theory of human sociality than I think any of us realized back in 2013 when we first started talking. So I think it's incredibly exciting what we've been discovering together. And this is another way where what we're doing is a real culture change for an archaeologist.Not too long ago, I was watching a YouTube video about some physicists that got really excited when there was a problem with the launch of a communication satellite that gave it an extremely elliptical orbit around the earth. And of course from the point of view of a GPS satellite and the functionality of that piece of equipment, it costs somebody a lot of money that the malfunction happened.  But for these physicists, there was like, “Wow, we have an opportunity to test elements of Einstein's theory of general relativity using this highly elliptical orbit.”  And something that the physicist said in the video that really hit home with me was:  “What we most wanted to do is get a result we didn't expect.  What we most wanted was to get a result that was inconsistent with general relativity, because that would tell us that there was something more to learn and something more to do”. That idea came from having a theory that was well enough developed, like general relativity, that when you do get an unexpected result, it is interesting and exciting because it does lead you in a new direction.  But that's partly because there's already reasonable support for general relativity; it's been tested in many ways and Einstein’s ideas have been found to be really good at capturing reality. So that really stuck with me, and it's been something that our group has been trying to do with studying scaling effects in the archeological record too, is to try and find cases where these relationships don't happen and then to ask, “Well, why not?”  And see if that leads us to a deeper understanding of the process overall. And there's a couple of papers that we have in progress, coming out soon, that are starting to do that. Now that we've seen the regularity in enough cases and enough reason to have some faith in the theory that we're working with, now we're at the stage where cases that don't work are actually more interesting. And again, for an archaeologist to have been involved in finding a regularity, that's strong enough that…   For most people in my field, the first time you would find a result that doesn't fit, you would just throw out everything and start over. You know, you'd be like, “Okay, fine. That was a dead end.” And you're done.  In this case, it feels more like, “No, we're not at the dead end, it's that we're actually probing the edges of how these processes work and how to better conceive of them and to understand them better by seeing areas where they break.”The clearest example that we've been working with is a big database of information on the temporary camp sites made by hunting and gathering peoples around the world.  A researcher combed through the ethnographic literature and compiled this huge database of the populations and areas of temporary hunter-gatherer camps from all over the world and when you look at the relationship between the number of people that camp together and the amount of space they take up, what shows up very clearly is that hunter and gatherers camp increasingly spread out the larger the camp gets.  The more people camp together, the more space they put between each other. And that's the exact opposite of what happens in cities, all around the world, which is the more people live together, the closer they pack together.And so here's an example of something where, wow, okay, hunter-gatherers don't do what people do in cities. They're clearly doing something else. Why is that? What's missing? Is it something social?  Cultural? Is it energetic? Is it because they don't have reliable food supplies? Is it because they don't have the social institutions that allow strangers to interact in a kind of mutually beneficial way? What is it that they're missing? And in answering those questions, then you begin to learn more about the emergence and evolution of the social processes that characterize the world that we know today. And it suggests there was a time when they didn't exist. And in a sense it suggests that there's evolution here in human sociality, an evolutionary story to explain. So that's an example of an area that I think is super, super exciting, where we have some papers in progress right now.Michael (29m 60s):So, you know, to draw a link to the conversations that we had for Jeffrey West on this show back episodes, 35 and 36, to talk about the deviations from that fit. You know, I think maybe one of my favorite examples is the example he gives in scale about the human being itself and about when you look at the, you know, the metabolic rates of these different organisms that a modern technological human being is using more calories. You know, when you count our entire technological footprint, you know, we're using something like 30 times as much energy as you would expect for another mammal of our body size.And so you have to think about the human being as deviating from this plot, by regarding us as not being merely the mass of the flesh deal, limited organism, but you have to include everything else that we have taken in, again, functionally into the anatomical behavioral systems pattern of what it is that we are in this world now. And I think looking at that, one of the things that I love in particular about the paper that you lead authored for your work in the central Andes is how this kind of thinking inverts the assumptions that we, you know, so many people are spouting this rhetoric have been for, for centuries about the way that human culture, society and technology are driving one another. That for example, human lifespan and quality of life, the intricacy of society are, you know, are driven by technological innovation or driven by market activity. And in this particular study, one of the results is that this is precisely backwards. That again, you know, like with Jeffrey West talking about how the increased pace of life inside one of these social reactors that a city is, is the actually the engine powering this accelerating crisis innovation cycle.And so I'd love to hear you get into a little bit of the details about how it's the connectivity of these social networks, not the expansion of long range trade, not market development, not technological progress that is changing everything, including all of those things that we just mentioned. It's sort of like, not the other way around, like how, how did you come to this? You know, what does it, what does it look like? You're talking about the, the Inca expansion absorbing various other cultures like Montaro and Wonka and how it changed their way of life. But again, not because they were suddenly, they suddenly received as like this boon of higher technology from the Inca, but that it was, it was changing the structure of the functional relationships within those societies. So, yeah, could you go into a little bit more detail about that?Scott (32m 55s):Well, I mean, according to the theory that we're working with, there are scale free effects of human agglomeration, or, you know, the number of people being able to interact with each other in space that are open-ended that they provide benefits as far as people can take them. But of course, all of humanity does not live in one city today, and the reason we can't for lots of different reasons, you know, one is that there'd be no way to get food to humanity if everyone lived in one city. There's also, of course, there are social divisions around the world today. There's conflict, you know, I mean, we're having enough trouble sticking together just as the United States right now.So, you know, not, not, not to mention the conflicts and international relations that go on. So, you know, there's lots of other cultural, political, economic, energetic, technological barriers to the realization of that potential that we think is always there. And so all of these other things that go on in society in a sense, they come together to set what that potential is, and what we find is that societies generally grow to take advantage of whatever, whatever levels of agglomeration they can handle based on this other, the rest of the milieu that they're operating in. And in general, you know, everywhere we've looked, the material standards of living of human beings improve as their levels of agglomeration grow.Scott (34m 24s):That's on average, of course, there's lots of variation. Of course, it's of course there's fluctuations in that. Of course there are still injustices and experiences that many of us have of urban problems. These are statistical averages. They're not what must happen for every case at all times; they are the average outcome across many instances of what happens. So we think that those processes are always there. And one way that this realization does bump up against some traditional stories in archeology has to do with the emergence of civilizations, of early civilizations. I would say that ever since a very famous archeologist named V. Gordon Childe wrote Man Makes Himself back in the mid 20th century, the dominant approach in archeology concerning the emergence of civilization is been more or less that it involves a small group of wealthy and powerful people convincing the rest of society to support them and to labor longer and harder to pay their taxes, to support people who were more or less parasites, and basically because of power and because of the ability of leaders to control violence and things like that, people more or less just had to play along.And what I would say is that that view presumes that there's no intrinsic benefit to figuring out how to live together in a city, and that the reason cities emerged is because leaders forced people to do it, or because people had to do it to defend themselves from the enemies of the leader, you know, who responded by having [inaudible]. So everyone has their own army, and so you live behind the walls in a city to protect yourself, and you give taxes to the leaders who keep you safe. You know, that's sort of the way it's often evolved in archeology. And so what it suggests is that civilization is in a sense false consciousness in Marxist terms, that the average person doesn't actually benefit from it, and that people would have been better off if it had never happened in the first place. And it's a pretty utopian kind of Edenic view. Of course, if civilization had never happened, there would be orders of magnitude fewer human beings on the earth that might be better for the earth, but there wouldn't be more people. So if your measure of success, if humanity is how many people you can give life to, well, I hate to tell you, but civilization was a pretty good invention, despite all the other problems that it has. So I would say that the work that we're doing helps to, in a sense of balance out that narrative, by describing some of the intrinsic benefits that flow from humans figuring out how to live together and develop economies, where there's mutually beneficial exchanges between individuals, despite all of the power asymmetries and warfare and injustices that come along with it.You know, what I would say is that the net benefits of all of that have to outweigh the net costs, or else civilization wouldn't have emerged independently in seven different places around the world, and within a few thousand years of people figuring out how to produce a reliable food supply and develop infrastructure that was fixed in place. And it happened everywhere. That's all you're saying that human beings everywhere somehow were subject to the same false consciousness everywhere? Well, I guess I'm a little bit more optimistic than that view, but again, this is a big change for [inaudible] who has tended to largely adopt a critical stance on power and inequality. And this work suggests that, well, it's a little bit more complicated than that, and that we need to think more about it.Michael (38m 1s):Yeah. So in the work that you did on Rome, I like when you're, you're looking for how to, how to think about these things, how to measure these things. You're looking at again to think about this in terms of, like you said, the aerial view of things and how, again, to compare this to Jeff West and Jim Brown, Brian Enquist, and the way that they link urban scaling to the metabolic scaling and organisms, you think about the fora and the agorae of the Roman empire and the streets and the lengths and the widths of the street networks, like transportation networks, like the circulatory system of an organism, and, you know, naturally to call again on Jeff West episode and the conversation I had with Chris Kempes and with Melanie Moses on the show, there are physical limits to how big those networks can grow in an organism, be it unicellular remote multicellular, or, you know, a social superorganism like an ant colony. And so this gets into a tricky question that Jeff raises in his book and that we discussed in the conversation, which is have we followed the benefits, the increasing returns to scale of these increasingly enormous agglomerations of human beings kind of off the cliff? Like, are we, when you look at the way that human social organization has decoupled in, you know, important ways from spatial organization, you know, like as of yesterday, the late cultural historian, William Erwin Thompson, a shout out to him and his conversation on the evolution of human society from what do you call sanguinal to geographic and now noetic polities, you know, that you look at the way that people think about Facebook as one of the world's largest nations now.So this is a digital Agora that is threatening in certain ways, the fabric of the cohesion of human society because of its enormous scale. And I'm just curious, I mean, there are certainly, there are things that could be said about the way that these systems depend upon an unjust simplification of the models of reality, you know, the externalization of certain ecological and economic costs. But yeah, I'm curious to know from you in thinking about all of this, you know, what do you make of the insights from settlement scaling theory to what is going on right now with this weird remix of spatial and non-spatial human interaction and what kind of insights this might shed on the future of human social organization and the sustainability of that organization?Scott (40m 40s):Yeah. Those are deep and important questions. I have a few thoughts, although, you know, I'm sure others will have more. One thing that occurs to me is that actually a friend network on Facebook is much less diverse than the scope of direct and indirect interaction, physical interactions that a person has in the real physical city. So, you know, even from the point of view of like, if you're commuting on the highway, you've got a whole bunch of other people with many different perspectives, beliefs, you know, other things that are all following the same rules for the mutual benefit of everyone on the road.Or if you go to the grocery store, you know, the diversity of people in that store or the diversity of people that you interact with and getting your food for the day is orders of magnitude more diverse, I would say, than the people you tend to be friends with on Facebook. So what I think is being revealed is that social media is actually serving to isolate us from each other, actually in an ironic way, relative to what actually has supported the development of society as we know it. So I am actually quite concerned about that, but you know, at the same time at time, it's also super interesting. I mean, more and more of a person’s  physical needs can seem to be able to be met through the Internet because of all of the people who are increasingly putting their efforts into, for example, fulfilling grocery orders for someone, and then delivering them to their home so that you don't even have to go to the store to get the energy that you need.And you can get really good food that way. And you could, you know, and so on and so forth, you know, so the abstraction of the information dimension of society from its energetic and physical dimensions is it seems to me like it's really putting some stress on it, but at the same time, I also think that life has changed in ways that I hadn't imagined when I was a kid. You know, I hadn't imagined that we would have GPS's and that when you wanted to go somewhere, you would just tell your phone where you wanted to go, and it would speak to you and tell you what to do. And, and that we'd be able to have a video conference, you know, and teach classes through the computer without ever leaving our home. And all these amazing things have happened that I think if you just go from the beginning point and the end point, you say, how in the world did this occur, but yet if you live it step to step, it said every step of the way people are responding to the problems right in front of them, and exploring the space we inhabit and figuring out how to move the boundaries in different ways. I guess what I'm saying is, is that the fact that many of us are noticing these kinds of stresses that come from the way social media abstracts our information, the information dimension from the rest, I suspect society will try to respond to it. And that the future will be different than what we are living in right now. I think that will continue.One question that I think is super interesting to think about that we deal with a lot thinking about the archeological record is that there are many ancient city cities of the ancient world. They started small, they grew to a certain point, they got big, and then they plateaued, and they more or less stayed like that for centuries, often. One possible interpretation of that, again, given that there would have been increasing returns for them to continue getting it bigger, is that the energetic milieu of that society or the social milieu didn't allow it to get any bigger. There were some other constraint that kept it there. A fascinating question is whether the world we live in today is bumping up against constraints or not. Unfortunately, I think it's hard to know ahead of time. I think you can only know it in retrospect, although, you know, I welcome some ideas about how you could know it ahead of time.I do think that most ancient societies did bump up against what was feasible and then they just sort of hung out there at the limits and much more frequently than in our experience. It's a huge question for sustainability, of course, whether, whether we're already operating near the edges of what we can do, I would say that because our technology is changing so fast, we're probably, I suspect we're actually not at the limits yet. The question will be whether we can continue to evolve in ways that don't destroy the earth and the process of us continuing to explore what we can do as a society.Michael (44m 55s):So to speak to that, and I know that you've got to go here soon, but I think if I can squeeze in a quickie bonus round, one of the things that you brought up a couple of times in this, you know, the overarching theme of adopting a uniformitarian lens to view the ancient world, the current world, and, you know, potentially the future world, speaks to the erosion of, as I think you said earlier, this idea that the world that we're looking at is somehow encapsulated in the past that, you know, that archeology is very much a discipline of the way that people are across time and space. Studying the Maya, it's not like the Maya disappeared, their social organization changed, but they're still there. They're still speaking the language.Scott (45m 40s):Well, but who is the they, right? I mean, what do you mean by that?Michael (45m 44s):Right? But you coauthored this opinion piece in PNAS on understanding migrations and looking at the past of human migration and what kind of light it might shed on climate migration, the kind of challenges that we discussed with Martin Scheffer and Tim Koehler back in episode 33. And you say in here, this is really key. I really liked this. You said for archeologists to be successful in this, they must not only listen to effected communities, but bring them into our research, traditional knowledge experts, and elders must not be subjects to be interviewed, but instead collaborators in identifying the problems to be studied and how to study them. So this really, this speaks again to a way that this discipline and anthropology and other disciplines have changed their thinking over the last century, you know, that it's no longer this sort of elite imperialists colonizer type of perspective on the communities and the societies that you're learning from, but like weaving them into the process.And just as a parting thought, I'd love to hear you talk about in practice, what this actually means for the way that archeology has performed today and you know, how it might change the way that we practice it in the years to come.Scott (47m 3s):I mean, archeology has traditionally focused on geographical diversity, of course, in addition to evolution over time. And there's tremendous geographical diversity still today in human culture and society. And so integrating what archeologists learn about the histories of peoples and cultures in different parts of the world with the frame of mind of the inheritors of those traditions and the types of knowledge that those communities have accumulated through the history that you learn about through archeology is I think an important way of, again, perhaps unifying the heritage and imagination aspect of archeology with the science of it.So, one example that I can think of is much of my direct archeological field work takes place in Northern New Mexico. And I, and I work in close partnership with people in the Pueblo communities of New Mexico in my work, and in those communities, there's a sense that the human community has a responsibility to the stewardship of nature, and that there is a moral obligation to it, and that it leads and all sorts of cool and interesting and different directions than the Western thought tradition does with regard to the ways in which human beings treat each other and the ways in which they operate on a landscape. Well, Pueblo ancestors have bequeathed to the present and the future and amazing archeological record of the experiences of people that have lived with those philosophies.They've still grown and changed and evolved and had their struggles and successes, all the kinds of things we're familiar with. And yet there also were some interesting kind of fundamental philosophical differences between the Native American way of thinking about the nature of reality and about the relationship between humans and the world, the idea that humans are a part of the world, a part of the ecosystem, as opposed to something separate from it. Wilderness and makes no sense to a Native American. There's no such thing. Humans are in the wilderness all the time, if you're a Native American, right? So the idea that archeologists can learn about the long-term consequences of values as they play out in the big picture, I think is a very exciting and interesting direction to move.And I think it also asks all of us to be a bit more humble about the things that we believe we know, and to say that well, you know, there may well be reasons why societies that think in the ways that Western society does have grown and achieved this sort of cultural hegemony over the earth. I mean, certainly modern science is an outgrowth of the Western way of thinking. And I would say, you know, there is such a thing as native science, but it's very different than Western science, and objectively, of course, you know, its accomplishments are, are different. They're not as extensive by certain ways of thinking about it as Western science would be.On the other hand, if human communities have been able to persist at high densities, with limited technology and maintain an environment and maintain ecosystem functions, you know, beyond the human community in ways that are natural or that emanate naturally from the philosophy of the people, I think applying the tools of Western science to those sorts of things, to help us understand them better and help us to incorporate them better into our own future, I think is, would be a good thing to do. It seems to me like all of us would benefit from a bit broader understanding of these issues. So yeah, I think it's an exciting area.And I think that's one of the key reasons why traditional knowledge keepers in different communities around the world are an important ingredient of the kind of collaborative synthesis work that we've been talking about.Michael (50m 55s):Awesome. That's a real potent place to end it. Scott, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us today.Scott:Sure. Yeah, I've enjoyed it.

And now thanks to the surfeit of textual data offered up by social media researchers can peer into the dynamics of human society and analyze the turbulent flows of stories that drive our collective behavior and twist time itself into nonlinear structures. As a species we're on the cusp of a new epoch in which the body politic reveals itself to us in real time like a single human body in an MRI. How will these tools change how we think about the world and what it means to be a person in it? Welcome to complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week, we speak with Peter of the University of Vermont's Complex System Center and Computational Story Lab, about how to use Twitter data as a kind of satellite telescope observing the collective mentation of humankind, what it reveals and what it doesn't.   Opening a cornucopia of questions about how we measure sentiment and the power of narrative for social control.

Thank you for listening. (3m 45s):Peter, welcome to complexity podcast.   Peter:It's a delight to be here. Michael:It's a pleasure to have you. So before we dive into the numbers and the sort of God's eye view of things that you have revealed through your research, I'd like to start with a bit of human background anchor this in a bit of story. You like wrangling stories so what story can we have about how you got into your life as a researcher, and what drew you into the kind of questions that animate and inspire you to do the kind of work that you? Peter (4m 28s):So that could be a long story. I guess in short, I'm sort of a meaning seeker, you know, I'm kind of one of those people, like what, why does anything exist? Kind of all this sort of stuff. And so that's drawn me to think about lots of things from my life, you know, religion, science, all these pieces, all these ideas of how you should live your life and how we are living our lives. So I'm just this curious person, but in terms of coming to think about complexity, you know, there's a friend of mine, I'm from Australia originally, that handed me a book and said "You should read this book." It was Mitchell Waldrop's Complexity book. (5m 10s):This was a long time ago when I was an undergrad and I read it and I thought this was fantastic. I ended up getting to the States as a result and since then it's just been, what can we understand about everything. So I could've end up in string theory but that's not where I am so this opening of thinking about human systems and systems that humans are attached to, so you know, climate change as part of that, this is kind of everything we touch on now. When I think of a socio-technical system it just opened up and up over the last 20 years. (5m 50s): I've just been drawn along and there's always something new to think about. I will just sort of end by saying, we want to create things that are meaningful, that help the world and that matter.  I know that students over the years have been attracted to the work we do so that's good. You know we want to do meaningful things. We're not just aliens watching humanity, we're part of a system and we care. Michael (6m 20s):So yeah, you brought up aliens. We are the universe becoming aware of itself type sentiment that I think really sings through the work that you do and the work that you and your community of people around you are doing at the Vermont Complex Systems Center and elsewhere.  The right place to start here, I think, is just with the idea that the kind of work that you do is even possible. So I would like to talk a little bit about the background and the conceptual framing for Story Wrangler, because this is the kind of thing that I don't know, maybe when I was in high school would have been in like a minority report style science fiction films, and now here we are. In one sense, utterly prosaic and mundane, and in another sense, completely wondrous and numinous, and honestly kind of terrifying.(7m 28s):We'll put a pin in that and get back to that. But I'd love to hear you talk about how this project came to be and you know, how people started to thinking about how to ask and answer these kinds of questions._____Peter (7m 42s):Well I think thinking of stories collectively and at the population level is still pretty primitive.  I've come to feel it's just a crucial, crucial thing in science for us to understand how people tell stories' how they believe stories, how they spread stories and how various cultures across many different fields have studied this for a long time. But I think there's an opening now in this sort of big data world to maybe start to create something that's really solid and endures. It goes back to us measuring happiness was this sort of first big data thing that we did. And before that, I had done experiments looking at how things spread, how things take off Peter (8m 25s):so I think we have an understanding of same from that. So there were experiments and that was enabled by finally were not studying 100 people in a psych one-on-one course or doing surveys. Those things are still important, right?  I would never pretend that our work wipes out other fields, it augments it and adds to it. So going back in time we started to see that we could do these experiments that involve hundreds of thousands of people. And then data came along, social data and to some extent it's the social media stuff but blogs before that, perhaps, so people are putting these expressions online and Peter (9m 5s):it's not being filtered through experts and a few anymore. You're starting to get the murmurings saturations of a populace, you know, and what do you do with that? I mean, we can see the stars, right? So we start off looking at them from thousands of thousands of views and eventually we get some telescopes together, pretty terrible to start with, but, you know, we keep getting better with that. And then we have a raise of telescopes and it switches completely to, you know, much more of a data driven kind of situation where you're not necessarily ever looking through a telescope. So I feel like I looked at that, that sort of history, the history of building thermometers, the history of building clocks, you know, and you can go back and think about how we just, we couldn't measure these things well. Peter (9m 48s):And in some cases like temperatures is an example, I guess there's some argument about this, but maybe we never thought that was a number that you could measure, right? Someone else could have make another instrument and measure the same numbers as you. That there was some sort of human element to it that made it fuzzy. It's different than measuring distance. We were so solid on distance that that becomes this substructure for the metaphors, for everything we use, even time, you know, distances is fundamental thing. So, you know, we've slowly as scientists gone out and measured everything. And I think of basic sciences describe and explain, right? Peter (10m 30s):And then after that, you get to create, you get the goals and predict all those things. We kind of race the prediction, but you know, the call for me is describe and explain, and you've got to describe. And so I feel like we try to do everything, but we're a bit in that game when we start to measure what we'll get to hear as stories, but it was, you know, what do we do with all of these inputs coming in from the outside world.  This is now through the internet, you know what can we sort of sense from that? We had this big idea to start with which was what about happiness? Right? So at least that gives us something we think is important for society. You know, it's a bit of a popular framing, but it's different than a GDP, right? Peter (11m 12s):You know, at the end of a news pieces like local news, the GDP went up on the market, it's like this really important an thing? Same with the weather here are these basic things of today. And what about something like happiness well being, these are harder things to measure. And in fact, when we went to look at how to measure happiness, and this is from texts and ultimately from Twitter and books and all sorts of things, what we look back on on psychological research, happiness is really the first dimension of meaning. And this is based on work, asking people and the semantic differentials. How do you feel about something on some semantic differential, rough to smooth, happy to sad, angry, powerful to week, do you feel out of control, excited to bored? Peter (11m 59s):And it turns out that these old studies at least came up with these sort of three main dimensions and their happiness balance, this kind of happy sad axis. And that's really the dominant one. And then excitement, do you feel excited for support and then power, dominance? So we've sort of stripped off that first dimension and we applied it to all sorts of things, including the count of Monte Cristo or Frankenstein, right? So you do those with books, try to measure happiness in this kind of big reading way, right. And we've done it with Twitter, which we'll get to a Story Wrangler. And that goes back to 2008, it's daily, we're going to have within a day stuff soon, I think. What we're trying to do Peter (12m 42s):there is just take all of twitter in different languages and you don't want to read 50 million tweets a today, right? We don't want anyone to do it. No one should do it, but know we can talk to our computers and they can sleep past them and they can get a feel for the whole thing. I'm only being able to show is that that correlates, let's say state level well with Gallup polls, it connects well with major events that happen in the world, particularly negative events. They really stand out and there's still a long way to go with this, but this is a kind of a, I don't know, it's a remarkable thing to be able to build. We're very worried about it from the start thinking of this leading to like brave new world or, you know, being part, you know, that sort of these foundational texts that we should worry about all the time or 1984. Peter (13m 28s):Right? So there's the big we're watching everyone kind of thing. Of course, we only look at public stuff and then, you know, what do you do? What's your public policy as a result? You know, what do you do? And our framing is, this is just something more to put on the dashboard, right? You're flying a plane. We understand with planes, we want lots of instruments in front of us. We don't want just one number that says plane okay, plane not okay. That's a bad dashboard. And I will say this more generally about complexity, we have a huge proclivity as human beings. And some scientists inclusive to really want to measure something with one number. Like he's this huge complicated thing and let's just get it down to one number because then we can talk about it, it'll be easy. It's a real disservice, especially from the scientific community. Peter (14m 8s):So we're very mindful of that. We're trying to just put another number on a dashboard, and then we want people to look at, I mean, if you think about the ecosystem collapse or something like that, there are a number of dimensions that you should be looking at. You know, you don't want to be just sort of thinking about some big number, you want to be looking at Keystone species. You know, all these different pods, sort of systems. So that's the happiness work that's ongoing and what we're trying to get to now is, you know, and many people sort of, I think, coming around to this, like, how do you measure those stories that have been told by a population. And we deliberately want to be away from individuals because we don't want to be invading their space. Peter (14m 49s):We don't want to say, look this person did this. So a lot of that stuff is very thermometer like, it's very distant. So it just by its nature will not function at a small scale. I mean, I think there's both a privacy concern there that's felt. And then the second is just also doesn't really work and people will tell you it works, but you know, you hand someone a tweet and put it through their machine and it says happy or sad maybe, but I think that's pretty dangerous. You know, individual sensors, these are hard things to base your whole decision of how to do something based on one statement, we can argue about that. So for instance, Parkland happens and now I'm well-prepared to understand what happened the next day, which was conspiracy theories emerged. Peter (15m 33s):And I remember going to YouTube just to see what the balance was, and that's sort of typical thing where you search and they give you 20 results. The 20 top hits, 18 of them were conspiracy theory videos about crisis actors and so on and two were just straight up news pieces. How do we measure that and how do we track them? Just, and you know not conspiracy theories aside, like reasonable narratives around something. It's hard to know what's going on. How do we do that? What are the stories that people hold in a population? And how is that trending over time? And again, you know, this is not to create a system of control, but it's partly to give people back information, you know, look, here's your world. Peter (16m 13s):People are not happy in this year compared to last year, or here are the stories everyone's talking about. So you may think because, and I think this is really a fundamental thing about social phenomenon, is what you might think about what everyone else is doing. Well, I don't know. Right? So you don't want to ever really project your own family onto the world, or, you know, what happened to you with your friend? You know, you can think about that, but it's, it's pretty fraught. And I think, you know, we need to have these sort of big picture views. So feeding back to individuals, feeding back to populations, but also to policymakers, I do think I, you know, they need to see this in the dashboard, not just money went up. Michael (16m 49s):So you're talking about the heatonominator. Yes, Which people should go look up online. It's, glorious. I mean, Glory is in a kind of a tragic way because you do actually see this who we've been slumping as a society as measured by this instrument over the last several years and that sort of begs its own question about the causes behind that. I think we might be able to poke at that question throughout the rest of this conversation, but then this other piece, which you and your coauthors on this piece laid by, is it Fairalshabi? Michael (17m 29s):An interesting article, "Story Wrangler, A Massive Exploratorium for Socio-linguistic,  Cultural, Socio-economic and Political Timelines using Twitter." Yes. Quite, quite a masterful mashup of all kinds of different interests in this one paper and you make a point here that, you know, people might be familiar with Google angrams, google angrams do not give you a sense, in spite of what you might think, of the popularity of a given word or phrase, because it's just how many books were published in that year. Michael (18m 11s):And it's not how many people were actually talking about those books. So like you say here actually 1984 or the Percy Jackson books of Ricky Arden, they're read and re-read, they're shared spread around. And so there's this question, not only of sort of the number of species, but of the interactions of species within this memetic ecosystem. If I can annoy some people with my flagrant use of the ecosystems and memes in this conversation. I mean, there's just so there's so much here, you know, and so I would just love to hear you talk a little bit about first of all, I think you're right, Michael (18m 56s):I think that this it's very clear that reading this work and looking at the diagrams in this paper. That what we're seeing is sort of like the earth from space, you know, like Stewart Brand petitioning to get NASA to declassify those blue marble photographs back in the sixties. And now it's like, well, here it is. You know, and like maybe Twitter was doing this. We know Facebook is looking at this stuff, the orbital view of people in this way that they, you know, they have massive teams of internal researchers, but it's awesome to actually have your hands on this kind of a dashboard and to be able to search. Michael (19m 39s):I was looking at, because I'm a dork, I was looking at dinosaurs on story Wrangler. And then I was looking at where the spikes were and then I cross-referenced it to Jurassic and sure enough, the major spikes were concurrent with the release of Jurassic park movies and video games. So, you know, I was like, Oh yeah, yeah, that makes sense. But it was nice to see that there is a sort of a, a hum of continuous interest in dinosaurs. I was like, yes. So the geographic features of the knowest sphere, right? Like VI Vernadsky's notion that what we have done is we've created this layer of mental activity around the planet and you and your colleagues have added this extremely important dimension, which again is the relative population sizes and rates of transfer and the relationships between all of these different ideas as they're flying around in this, this meme space. Michael (20m 44s):So I'd love to hear you talk a little bit about how you actually went about partitioning this, doing the research, organizing this data, and then maybe perhaps, you know, what were some of the things that surprised you in your findings in this piece?  Peter (21m 1s):Well, so I want to say overall, we've set up this site, it's storywrangling.org and it's just an opening, I think, to an enormous amount of research. So we're really excited. So in part, we're putting this out as a massive sort of data resource for people and we're kind of excited about what that will build, but it's something that we've wanted to do for years and we've made little sort of pokes in this direction, but this is going back to 2008 is when we first wrote to Twitter and my colleague, Chris Danforth wrote to them and just out of the blue and said, could we maybe get some tweets? And there were only four people working there.  It was a small thing at a time and they said, Oh, sure, so we have this little sort of feed. Peter (21m 42s):So we've been getting 10% of the tweets since then. So in terms of, you know, from the data source point point of view, that's how it started, just from an email and largely at no cost which has been a tremendous service. Twitter has gone through various stages and it will keep going through them being knocked as being frivolous and silly, and it will go away. Of course, it's been rather important I think in the last five or six years. It's also perhaps held a place that Facebook hasn't in terms of this, if people put quotes out, put statements out, it's the stuff that gets embedded in other news stories. So they've really kind of held that space quite well, but it is remarkable that so much is on Twitter. Peter (22m 24s):The dominant thing I'll just say from the start is it's kind of K-pop right. So K-pop is enormous and and we just have to acknowledge that, but music is, sports is enormous, you know, these movies, as you pointed out, right? These, when some of those advertising, some of it is just, people are excited about it, TV shows. So that's sort of, I feel, like just to kind of talk about what it is that's become to me like the resting state of the thing. Like when Twitter is going along, you know, when the world is sort of going along somewhat peacefully, nothing terrible has happened. That's the stuff that's going to be bubbling to the top, which seems, okay, it's sort of water cooler discussion writ large, right, At a population scale, but to really process this data well, it's taken many years graduate students to come along and try all sorts of things. Peter (23m 9s):And we use a supercomputer here at UVM, which seems maybe a lot for tweets, but it's a big database and we'll have to say that emojis have proved to be an incredible complication from a data point of view. I mean, they're just curious animals, right? I mean, if you're an ecologist, this will be like tyring to catch ghosts or something, you know, it's really, really, really a mess. So we've dealt with that and you know, they're all in there as well. You can see the rise of emojis in particular ones, instructions. So this is one of those things you will see, like you mentioned Google angrams, right? So that's from books. There's a nice little viewer and it's easy to go to. And as a user, you think, Oh, this is really easy, Peter (23m 50s):it's a thing but the backend of that is really, really hard to create because every day you have to look at the forest. I like the ecology thing. There's this forest of this ecology of words that's put out and we have to kind of take it all apart and count up all the little bits. And then we look at the next day, you know, how much did this forest turnover from day to day, to day? And for Twitter, it's pretty rapid, you know, a new species can come and go on in a day in terms of angram or whatever. There is just so much to look at that you can think about the in training of like really basic things like how will you function because we're in a solar system, right? So you see the patten of the months and the lunar cycles and all those things in years. Peter (24m 34s):I mean, that's going to sound trivial, but if, you know, it's there, you could kind of actually detect that from Twitter if you looked at it and you had nothing else, you could figure out for 65.2, it's, it's a curious thing. But then you start to see, you know, events that we celebrate every four years or something like the Olympics, you start to see those kinds of spikes and then it gets more complicated when you get into political events and turmoil and, and changes. I mean, I'm just looking at one now that we've been thinking about, which is the rise of the term fake news, right? So we have separate work on Trump and all the tweets that contain Trump. So just to connect to that later, you know, it's really, after Trump comes into that, he's elected and I can talk about that a little bit of dynamic that, but fake news goes from just the term that appears a little bit to a completely new state, but now it's a stably used term, it's just in the language, it becomes a species in the forest that was not there at all. Peter (25m 32s):And now it's just everywhere in the forest. And it's just a normal thing to encounter if you're walking into this forest of angram's. One of the next pieces we're trying to build now, this is kind of complicated, so you've got every day all these words are competing with each other and we'll rank them, right. We'll rank the words and I know there are a hundred languages so you can look through it in that way, but we also then want to be able to do this next step, which is to say, okay, you want to find all the tweets that continues an use and you want to then look at the story Wrangler for that. You want that first. So we're going to take that subset of tweets, which conceptually is easy to think about, but basically it means is universes within universes, you know, there's just this incredible sort of multi-verse linguistic, lexical multi-verse if you like, right. Peter (26m 17s):So you're going to say, I can go to this forest so I'm just going to sort of take all the Oak trees and everything else deletes. And then you're looking in that subset. So I think that's going to be powerful in terms of looking at how meaning changes around terms like news, for example. So fake news, you know, that that word is not attached to news and then suddenly it is, you know, what else has happened around a term, which is otherwise very stable. News is very stable over 10 years, the word news, fine. If just looked at you and say, Oh, you know, I guess it's just a fun thing, but it's the stuff that's, you know, code around it, rich complicated and you don't really, you know, in the world we live in really meaningful, right? This is a really powerful thing that's happening, the sort of transition to de-legitimizing the press and so on. Peter (27m 0s):So we have this online piece, you can play around with it. We have, I think, a really important part which is, and you mentioned it before with, with Google books. So we had an article, I guess it was published in 2015 where we brought out this critique of Google books, which at that time sort of remains now this kind of incredible lens into the last couple of hundred years, especially. And so that's taking old books and just counting up the woods. So each year it's at the year scale, the problem, yeah. Is it's the same as going to a library. And every book gets one book and you don't look at how much a book has been checked out or read if you could see that as well. And so that's obviously not right, right? Peter (27m 41s):It will give you something and it will look like popularity because you know the word, these huge ran the world Wars. Well, those words pick up, but it doesn't tell you exactly what people were reading. We do this all the time with corporate, I should say too, right? I mean, we do this all the time. People will take the New York times, study the New York times as it goes for time, but not index it by which articles were writ because in part, you know, it's easy to do that. First part you just have, the New York times is a copy of the paper kind of thing. And I think sometimes we know that, but sometimes we forget. So wiyh story Wrangler we have built into it, a little toggle, it's include retweets or not, which is very nice feature that we have for the system. Peter (28m 22s):We can just see what was amplified so we can kind of recreate the amplification that's in the system, or we can dial it down. We can pull that away. And it's been a really interesting thing to look at. So Twitter is deliberately recently tried to tame the amplification that's on its system and something I've talked about for years. So for instance, Instagram, for whatever problems it has, it doesn't have like a re Instagram. It doesn't have that kind of copy. If you're talking about memes, it doesn't have that kind of built in where you throw it out to everyone else, it's not built in, Twitter of course does, and Facebook as well. So if you remove all the friction and make that really easy, you know, amplification is really easy Peter (29m 2s):then, you know, you're basically lighting fires all the time or enabling it to spread through your forest, let's go back to that. So you can see, we can see that that's actually, we have these little contagious grams. You can see that that's being tamped down and that's not like the deleting accounts or deleting tweets. They're just simply making a little bit physically harder. Like you have to click on two or three things to retweet something purposefully, anyway, so that's a really important thing here. So some things really do get affected by whether they're amplified or not, Right? You know, when you turn that piece off. So actually I think maybe its was a simple thing to say, a lot of junk tweets Peter (29m 42s):They don't get amplified. So maybe astrology tweets, which are just sort of thrown out into the world, you'll see them if you turn off the retweets that kind of like they bubble up a little bit, but this is a forest that hasn't had the very imperfect and erroneous filter of humans. And I'm bots sitting on top amplifying things and spreading things. It hasn't had that filter and we don't always amplify the right things. We know that. And that's from some of that work and other people's work, right fame, the things that take off, they aren't always right at all.   Michael (30m 17s):It's funny that you mentioned that I was looking at the endgram history for complex systems. And like one of the all time high spikes was actually captured texts from the little preview that you get when you shared a horoscope. It was mentioned that an Aries horoscope in like 2016 Peter (30m 39s):And I was like, Oh, the work that we have done to promote this thing and like, of course. So you really do get it, you get a clear idea of what is actually capturing people. It's interesting that, you know, to extend this forest fire analogy, certain species thrive in systems that are regularly cleansed by fire and other species take over and then they don't. And yeah. And so I think that's sort of where Twitter is with this whole thing, you know they're actually trying to sort of shape the ecosystem, trying to make it less habitable or inviting for invasive species that know how to capture attention. Peter (31m 23s):Yeah. And so you have tweets that pour kerosene all over themselves and then, you know, basically they just, you know, I mean the most, your average person they're tweeting about a cat or they're tweeting about something. And so they're not trying necessarily, but if you have a sophisticated outfit, you can make it happen. So your algorithms have a built in structure that you have to be very mindful of. And people are very cleavor. Michael (31m 43s):There's one question in here that, I mean, this should possibly be self-evident in retrospect, but you and your coauthors mentioned in this paper, we see the time series for scientific advances, generally show shock like responses with little anticipation or memory to think about what you're actually reading as a kind of data visualization of again, the anticipation or memory of society. Then I don't know that's telling, that says something about the way that we habituate, I guess, to discovery, you know, like obviously we're not going to necessarily expect a particular, I mean, that's the whole point, right? We're not going to expect a particular discovery, but the fact that it just seems to fade from collective memory so quickly seems to say something about, perhaps it's best understood through the counterexample that you give, which is crisper, which is something that seems to really have captured the public imagination and is landed in a way with people that they understand it has, you know, ramifications that something like the discovery of gravity waves does not. But I'm curious what your thoughts are on what it takes for something to persist in cultural memory, or, you know, what this reveals about the mechanisms of cultural memory and its relationship to anticipation. Peter (33m 12s):I mean, this is such a profound question. When I mentioned fake news before, that's really actually what we're trying to get out there. We're trying to find all of the species that invaded and became new durable elements of the system. So I think we can actually do that at least, you know, in this second, you know, for this Twitter example, we can do it in kind of an exhaustive way, right? And so we'll have this, here's a list of things that became part of what we talk about. They became sort of the backbone of our conversation, normal, everyday durable things. And then we can look at the taxonomy of them, right, So fake news is a political thing. Like inception, for example, that movie really blew people's minds and still confuses, you know, it's still difficult to do with, but that became a thing. Peter (33m 56s):But for something to really take off, it has to get bound up in stories. It has to end up in stories, it has to end up in movies, your average person talking about it has to become something that they will use. And so when we see something become durable that's what's happened, you know, gravity waves was a cool story. We're kind of, there's a predisposition perhaps by going that science will produce cool things now, and then, and we'll get to be excited about it, especially like space, you know, that's really cool, but there's a huge amount of competition for attention and the stories that are bubbling and so on, the best producers of that, you know, the most durable ones, as I was saying before movies and sports and music, because there's this constant sort of creation of things and you know, where do you get fandoms? Peter (34m 43s):Where do you get fandoms? Fandoms built around those things? You have a sense of fandom around Trump, right? I mean, so you could kind of build them out as sort of analogous kind of groups. So when does that happen? This is the first sort of cultural products for terms that's, something else, you know, something becomes just something people, you know, like I dunno someone in a family system, someone else, you know, that's fake news. Like it becomes kind of a joke, a term that you can use at any point. I think we can do that. Of course we can't go back. This is Twitter, right? So we have this incredible resolution, this temporary resolution. That's something where we're sort of enjoying, of course it doesn't go back thousands of years. Peter (35m 27s):So that's a loss for us. It would be amazing to have tweets from whatever period you like, but yeah. Yeah. So, no, I do think scientific things kind of fraught in that sense. They do need, so science does need storytellers, of course. And it's really important for that to become part of popular culture for movies and these things to excite people and to make it kind of stick. And it will be interesting to see the vaccine, right. That vaccine is moving along, but there's been a jump in 2020, because it's just being talked about all the time. Essentially, just the jump with coronavirus coronavirus pandemic becomes real on March 12th. Peter (36m 10s):And then you see on our Story Wrangle viewer, that vaccine just sort of goes into a different kind of regime. It's just being talked about a lot, but it's been talked about a lot very recently, of course, with Pfizer and the other company claiming that the very close to asking for, I guess, permission to sort of build and distribute. So, you know, that's a scientific achievement that I think, you know, we may see more of a durable response to it. I've always wondered what would happen if that was just a straight up clear cut cure for cancer or something like that. What would happen with that? How would people respond around that? I will say people, people do tend to forget things pretty quickly. Peter (36m 54s):There's a lot of stuff passes away. And so that's been of great interest to kind of find what becomes durable. But yeah, there's a lot of stuff you think, Oh, you know, that's a big deal, but it's just a blip. Yeah.   Michael (37m 6s):It sounds like the right foothold to pivot or leverage ourselves into this other paper that you lead authored on Computational Timeline, reconstructions of the stories surrounding Trump, you know, using Trump as a case study to explore these concepts of story turbulence, narrative control, you and your coauthors call out, I love this, collective chronopathy. This is so so true. You know, this idea that the perception of time is subjective, and we know that perception of time is linked to the pace at which a person is experiencing and has to process information. Michael (37m 50s):So this gets at something that you were talking about in this paper, we were just discussing, which is competition for attention. And I would like to hear you introduce this piece in context of the question of, have you noticed any changes in the dynamics of attention over the history of these data sets? Because it would seem that, for example, like almost everyone knows the Beatles, but now a musician can sell more music than the Beatles ever sold and be known by a smaller fraction of the population. And so there's something going on Michael (38m 30s):it would seem with all of that. This gets to something that you were talking about in that first paper about the way that you can use this kind of analysis to forecast social fragmentation. You know, this is aligned with the work that David Krakauer and I talked about in the transmission series by Miguel Fuentes, he was looking at the fragmentation of social graphs, proceeding, social revolutions. At any rate, that's a whole basket of questions, really, but these are the thoughts on my mind when I'm reading this paper that you and your team wrote about Trump and what you found in terms of like reconstructing timelines and how you use this, you know, contagious programs to reconstruct narrative control Michael (39m 12s):and then what that says about the way that we perceive time and then this, quote, unquote, as you mentioned earlier at the beginning of the call, the distances between moments, and then what that means in terms of how these different histories, as they are held by different groups, how these different narrative framings are sheering against one another to create what you call story turbulence. So, yeah, it's a fascinating thing. I'd love to hear you riff on this for a while. Peter (39m 40s):Yeah. So this, this has been a couple of years of my life just really dedicated to this. I mean, I just really wanted to understand particularly this, this idea of turbulence, right? The turnover of story, and that led to these other pieces, which is, one is specific to Trump, but could be used for others, which is narrative control. And I'll get to that. But because we made up this word, I sort of use the old pronunciation, which is chronopathing. That's what happens with these things. So, but yeah, so the feeling of time passing and the idea that's collected that there is there an individual one, but there's also maybe something we can measure at a collective scale, but it was about story turbulence, which is just, you know, how much churn is there and is that changing over time? Peter (40m 28s):Is it always, even if there are these major events and you're kind of like put everything together, there's just sort of this churn. But we can also look at other things like baby names. We can look at the churn of baby names or just, and you could go to Google books and you could look at the words being used from year to year what's the turnover. Now somewhat very famously in complex systems there's this idea of heavy tail distributions and distributions in particular, right. Which goes back to George Kingsley. So it's this idea that if you rank things from biggest to smallest, and there's this heavy tail distribution of them, and this is a power of size distribution, right? So lots of rare things or small things, some really dominant ones. And there's this idea that those distributions don't change much as you go through time Peter (41m 11s):maybe. If you, look at book to book and so on, but of course they're categorical distributions, you know, there's a label, you know, whatever it is, you know, Los Angeles, New York city, if we think about cities, they're actual labels, right? So if you look at this Ziff distribution, this ranking of the biggest things, and you can think of music rankings, you can think of soccer rankings, whatever you like, as you look at that through timed maybe the distribution of their sizes, it doesn't change much, but of course there's a lot of this turbulence. And if we look at language, the words the and of say in English, yeah, they're pretty much at the top. So they're really pretty stable over time. There's not much change in the top 10, over a hundreds of years in languages, but as you go down, you start to get more and more, and I've talked about some frame, this is turbulence, and also sort of invoking this idea of influence of scaling, right. Peter (41m 60s):That there is a scaling that, that turbulence increases the further you go down and rank, and this there's quite beautiful scaling that you can see. All right. So that's sort of the, to sort of put it into complex systems in general markets. I said, baby names, ecological systems like numbers of species and forest and so on, but text is amazing, right? There's just so much that we have. All right. So we took, if you, like, we made story Wrangler for Trump, we took all the tweets that just matched Trump. And so that includes his handle. It includes trumpet. It just, we just did a very simple thing and it was enough to work because most of the tweets really about Trump and includes his retweets, you know, people re-tweeting, so that's built into it. Peter (42m 45s):And I will just back up one step and look, we have another paper where we've just simply looked at how much major political figures in the U S have been talked about since 2008 on Twitter. And that's it just very simple and there's nothing like Trump, right? So there's this big buildup around Obama. And it's talked about a lot on the election day in 2008, then it starts to fade away and then it's kind of up and down. You know, things happen, people talk about other stuff and the president matters, but it's not, you know, it's not always in view. And if you look at over time, these sort of like maybe in the thousands in terms of rank, and that's kind of like the UK, you know, sort of like dominated by the U S right. Twitter. So Obama in the UK kind of have a similar sort of name recognition, you know, like amplification. Peter (43m 31s):And if you think about marketing, right? Like how much do you want Pepsi or Coke talked about how, you know, what would you say? Like, you know, when you get your brand talks about, okay, so sure you want to be further up the ranks, but what's crazy about Trump. Trump has, since he took off and won, the election has been basically in the top 300 words every day, which puts him in the realm of function words. So these are just functioned words. So he is in the last three years, three or four years, he's like the word would, or man, like just, or say, just the most basic words that we'll use over and over again. He leveled up enormously and he was kind of fading after the, it was sort of going down and there's all these details, you know, what spiked and so on, early on, but you know, when he gets out, he's just, it's really kind of extraordinary to look at. Peter (44m 21s):And of course it's been talked about more than ever recently. So he's an unusual figure. There's an enormous amount of texts about him, you know, everywhere. But in terms of Twitter, we recreated this Story Wrangler thing for all the tweets that contain Trump. So now we've got this forest and every tweet, if you read it, we'll have Trump in it. And what we want to see is, you know, what are the sort of what's being talked about? And so we have a way of sort of trying to find the most narratively dominant word, which is to take a forest of words around Trump on a day, and look back a year ago. So that kind of takes out the year signal. And, you know, what's a surprising word because every day, you know, you still going to see if the awe of it, right? Peter (45m 2s):The basic words are still there, but you want to see one of the big movers, right? The surprising ones. And so as you look through time, you know, we've done this at day scale, week scale, month scale to kind of like, renormalize it, of course, 2016 is about the election and it's usually his opponents, right? So he's sort of, they're being talked about when you get in 2017, suddenly things kind of really take off, this year inauguration. Right. That makes sense. But then pretty quickly you get to Flynn, Russia, Komi, Mala, all those things come along. And then it can be very hard to remember all of this after say, what's their favorite, but North Korea, that's in August. And really, and that leads into the Charlottesville weekend. Peter (45m 44s):So North Korea, rocket man, all that sort of stuff, that kind of posturing, suddenly you have Charlottesville. Then you have hurricanes, Maria of course being devastating. All of these events 2017 in particular was all. And then the Mueller report is developing the background. So we kind of get that out. So it's like creating a, kind of a competently enabling historical analysis because it sort of produces the keywords, the dominant terms, one grams and two grams around a figure in this case, Trump and some of the frozen up and says, look, here's the backbone of what was talked about. It's true. It's through Twitter, but Twitter, you know, this is not an opinion thing. This is much more about what was the dominant stuff that was being talked about. Peter (46m 25s):Opinion is sort of more buried in here. So, you know, when you go into 2018, there's all this turnover. Again, Kavanaugh is a big piece there, for example, but towards the end of 2019, it becomes much more about impeachment. And then 2020 is really just this extraordinary year. I mean, we've never seen anything like this in, in all these years that we've looked at for hedonameter or for story Wrangler. So just to jump back to Hedonameter, they're the two events of coronavirus becoming widely accepted to be a really, you know, we talked about January and so on, but it's March 12th, MBA suspends the season, Tom Hanks announces he has coronavirus and Trump gives a speech. It doesn't go well in the oval office and the markets tank, not that all sort of happens within 10 minutes in the evening of March. Peter (47m 12s):Well, it's all happening. And it's just, it's kind of crazy. You know, it's, it's a crazy confluence of events. Hedonameter it just dropped. And then it took a long time to come back and we've never seen a collective response. We've always seen like something bad happens. You know, there'll be memories of those words that we certainly be talked about, but it gets washed over, you know, it gets washed over. And I look, I'll mention a particularly awful one, which was the Las Vegas shooting. This was horrific, but you know, now Hedonameter, there's a big drop and then it's gone. It doesn't mean the Las Vegas isn't still being talked about, but the wash of stories kind of wipes it out. When we see coronavirus that takes months to sort of get back to some kind of normal. Peter (47m 53s):And then George Ford's murder pushes it down to the lowest we've ever seen. And then again, that takes sort of a month to come out of those sort of signals are much more like what an individual might have. And so it's, that's real collective trauma. And these, these are real signals of collective trauma, ive never said it before. So, you know, throughout our instruments. So, but for Trump, what happened in 2020 is if you go back to the start of this year, the first thing that happened was Soleimani was assassinated, right? That was the start of it. Then the impeachment comes back into view that becomes dominant and then Corona virus takes off. And that becomes, he can't break that story. That story dominates Trump it's around Trump for really months on end, as you might expect. Peter (48m 35s):But then actually George Floyd's motor comes along and that is that him to talk, but that is an in for him. So when we look at narrative control, what we try to sort out there is these dominant terms around Trump. How much of it is actually just true to retweets of him? Know what fraction? And if you go back in time, you're crooked Hillary that's him, but also fake news, all the uses of fake news that you see connected to Trump and that kind of, that this virus we've made that's just the Trump virus, you know, whenever you see fake news, all of those fake news animals that you find in that forest, they're all retweets of him, basically, which hunters like that. So there are pieces that he's putting out, but he could not break coronavirus. He didn't use that term. Peter (49m 16s):He used other terms, some of them were derogatory, but he couldn't break it. And you can look in there and you can see like Obama gate, he's trying to throw in other things hydroxychloroquine or something. But he's trying to talk about other things altogether. He's trying to talk about corruption in the Democrats and you can see they kind of get into the top 10 words around him, but they never break this kind of I'll use the word wall of coronavirus that just stands in front of him and sort of what he's trying to get out publicly, but it's been much more jumbled since then. Pandemic has come back. COVID has come back. Those words have come back. So when we go to stories, let me say this too. We have our work studying pandemics after SARS, right? We looked at pandemics, we looked at historical pandemics and you know, what we're able to see there is that they're the most unpredictable of natural disasters. Peter (50m 5s):Let me, let me say it like that. You don't know how far they're going to go. They're very difficult to contend with this deep uncertainty and also the potential for resurgence. And we're seeing that sort of now, right? We're in this third major wave in the U S but this idea that you think the thing is going away, but it sparks up again. So the classic, if you go to simple narratives that, you know, the sort of core stories we have, right, there's romance, there's journey, one could argue, let's kill the monster, kill the monster is a story we tell over and over again, Beowulf, you know, stories where you overcome cancer. It's such an important Trump, and it's such a fundamental part of survival, right? This terrible thing happens. And it's not like you want to get out the other end of being, you know, 10 times better. Peter (50m 45s):You just want to get back to where you were and that's what pandemics are, we just want it to go away. That's why the magic bullet of a vaccine will, you know, it is something that people look to otherwise, it's this big collective action to try and like stop, limit the spread of it. Anyway. So in terms of the story around Trump, it's been a killer monster story in the sense of a horror movie story, because it keeps coming back, right. You know, this is one of the tropes of horror movies is the monster is never dead and you know, it, you're waiting for it to pop back up. Right. And so it's done that. It's done that. And more recently, of course, you know, he got COVID the narrative Ginsburg's death, and then, you know, the white house event and you know, that kind of bunch of stories there. Peter (51m 28s):And I will say one thing that isn't in our finished work is as this is going along, but we're watching these stories unfold. And if there are points and we haven't quantified this, you know, and this is sort of a great challenge, I think what is the uncertainty of now socially, right. And, and what is the incentive now? And I, I just, and this is just my gut feeling like when Ginsburg died, there was just all these sort of possibilities. And then when Trump got infected with COVID again, there was just this enormous range of possibilities. And I'm just saying what, you know, he could have died, or he could have, you know, not, not being sick at all. He kind of ended up with this almost resurrection kind of story, right? He's narrative there is, is a pretty good one for him. Peter (52m 9s):You know, he got him, he was definitely sick, but I mean, you know, he looked pretty unwell, but he recovers and he's, you know, he gets to portray strength and sort of to tie it all together. I mean, he's a storyteller, you know, that's my view of him. And he's a storyteller and this has been story versus the virus. This has been the game it's story versus the virus it's been pretty successful. And let me just tell you he's fundamental. We have this other work on the overall sort of emotional arcs within books within fictional works and what they're like, and this connects to Kurt Vonnegut, who said that you could do this, right? He thought you could do this. And he was upset that Michigan, I know was university of Chicago denied him the ability to do this as a thesis. Peter (52m 49s):He said, I, you know, I want to be able to measure the emotional locks of stories. So we did it, and it was kind of a, it's an homage to him really. But he had this one that he would talk about Cinderella and so on. He had the most basic one, which is, I need to describe it like this, you know, there is a sort of this wellbeing access a man and he portrayed it like this, you know, there's a guy he starts out okay and in time, goes this way and something bad happens and he gets out of it. And that's the story. And that's like, you know, like there are many stories like that. It gets back to normal and he called this the man and the whole story. And the thing is actually, that's not a good framing because it doesn't have any dynamic to it. You know, metamorphosis a deepening whole story, for example, but person in a whole, shall we say, there's no dynamic to it. Peter (53m 30s):It doesn't tell you where it goes, but make America great again, is a story in four words. It is really spectacular. It tells you about it indicates something about the past, the present and the future. And of course, it's not, you know, it's not who it's from. It's from Reagan and Bushes. That's as far as I know, it goes back to, from their campaigns in 1980, it was making, it was actually let's make America great again. So it was a little more collaborative, but you know, really powerful template and it's been reused, you know, bill Clinton used it and many other people have used it. So in terms of, you know, that's what I see. And I feel like, let me just add the turbulence part because I need you to say that. So there was a lot of turbulence in that sort of alluding to before in 2017, lots of scrambling, right. There was just so, and what that meant was there was no memory. Peter (54m 13s):Those are crazy things happening, and we're not talking about what happened the last month, because it's just fallen off the lip. You know, there's only so much you can handle, there's this new thing that's just erupted 2018, 2019, it's a little more stable and you start to get more stable things like impeachment, you know, it becomes more of a remembered thing and it's sticking, but you know, there are still things like Greenland trying to buy Greenland in August in 2019, right. That's sort of dominant story, which is pretty funny to reflect on, I think, but what you see in 2020 is a story that absolutely sticks and it's coronavirus, and that becomes the slowest turnover around Trump that we've ever seen until George Ford's murder and then there's this just really, cause that's the end of may, the month of June is, you know, just massive turmoil. Peter (54m 60s):You're broken from the previous story, but then both of those stories basically just persist. And so you see something like August, August starts to look like February, because coronavirus is the thing again, in terms of that nonlinearity of time, there's this strange thing where you can feel like it's like six months ago, last week can seem different. But now, because you know, right now, as we're recording this, the pandemic is really raging and there's a sense of panic buying feels like March again, right? That kind of lockdowns are kind of coming. So that time feels close again. And you know, maybe if you think back to some things you did in the summer, that actually may feel like years ago, but what happened then of course it was October, the start of that is Trump getting sick with COVID or infected with it in November, the rush and the of stories has just been enormous. Peter (55m 49s):And we quantify that, right? So we have, we have these kinds of measurements for doing this, but we try to actually really put a number on it. So let me just say that 14 days in April, which was so thinking about what happened two weeks ago, April's is really slow month because nothing seems to have changed. That feels like two days now. So November, like two days change in the forest, right? The forest is changing in two days in a way that it took 14 days to do back in April. But if you'd go to something like the summer, the summer, because if was starting to look like this early part of the infection, that's like six months in August starts to feel like 13 days. Now, if you think about how much turnover in the forest you had over six months back in August, that's happening in two weeks now, it's not linear. Peter (56m 35s):It's kind of a messy thing, but it's just, this is a powerful thing to look at. And then we have this crown apathic equivalency heat map, you know, we have these kinds of things and it just shows you, are we untethered to the past right now? Have we lost memory of what's going on? And you know, how much is sticking? And we'll see, I mean every month I kind of watch this thing for when I'm wonder where it will end up. And it's just been sort of, I was trying to say this before, just you just see the story in front of you just flapping in the wind. Like, you're not sure where it could go and what's the uncertainty of now. And right now, again, we're back in the deep uncertainty of these last couple of months. Michael Garfied (57m 13s):Well, this is, there's so much here so much, obviously it's worth bringing up Vladimir Elliott Lennon's quote, there are decades where nothing happens. And then there are weeks when decades happen. And, you know, when I had a SFI Miller scholar, Lawrence Gonzalez on the show to talk about trauma, this is what we're thinking about. You know, we're thinking about those moments where it's seared into your memory for the rest of your life, like the Chicksalube meteor impact, right? Or in general, you know, golden Eldridge talk about punctuated equilibrium. You know, that this notion that there's this sort of a, royaling micro evolutionary flux going on at all times, and then something happens and, and it changes everything. Michael (57m 55s):And then we move on and that's what we're seeing here. But I love that you described in this paper, the idea that a slow down in story turnover, a drop in story turbulence is when quote unquote and you've now created a rigorous quantitative way of describing this term, the plot thickens. 1 Peter Dobbs (58m 21s):It's true. I almost put that in the title of the paper, but yeah, Michael (58m 23s):That's great. I mean, I'm fascinated about this because, you know, I remember years ago, reading Doug Rushkoff's book, present shock when everything happens now and he was talking about, you know, the way that the internet in a way that I came to understand after reading his work resembles the functional MRI scans that I think it was Imperial college, London did on the brain under the influence of LSD and showing how that you get this massive increase in functional connectivity between brain regions that are normally inhibiting signals between one another. And that that's like what Twitter is doing for the collective brain of humankind. And when that happens, you get this huge boost to the noise in the system, and it makes it difficult for things to, if we're going to use your forest metaphor, for things to take root, when everything is going on all at once, then an event that would have seemed epical and defining of a generation is just lost in that wash that you were talking about. Michael (59m 28s):And so part one is, you know, what are your thoughts on, again, as in terms of like memory dynamics, the way that information is held in society. When we see things from space in this way, in the same way that, you know, astronaut rusty Schweikert turns around, or Edward Mitchell turns around and says, at least in the sixties and seventies, there were no definitive visible from orbit country lines. Now there are because of development and deforestation, but you get to see it in a unity that you didn't have. And it becomes clear that there is a self similarity across scales in which the collective dynamics of the entire human race and our collective cognitive activity resemble really much this kind of dynamic at the individual level, but where that gets kind of weird and creepy, cause I promised you, I was going to get into the dark side. Michael (1h 0m 21s):Like the weaponization of this kind of a tool, is again, to call back to the paper on story Wrangler. You mentioned changes in word popularity, predicting future changes in geopolitical risk. Like you were just talking about here. You know, you define it here as a decline in real activity, lower stock returns, movements and capital flows away from emerging economies. Following the federal reserve, you mentioned being able to track the words crack down in protest associated with changes in geopolitical risk index. And again, when you think about the fine line between genius and madness, right, between the increase in functional connectivity, leading to a brilliant creative innovation versus a schizophrenia break in personality, we've talked on this show with Carl Bergstrom, Jevon West with Eric Olsen and Vicky Yang about polarization and divergent reality tunnels. Michael (1h 1m 16s):And you know, what happens when the information is coming in so quickly and it's being integrated, the systems that were in place to integrate information at the collective scale are no longer satisfactory in their function. They can't keep pace with these things. And so, I mean, I guess part of the, the ominous question here is just how insane do you think the emerging collective mentation of our Noah's sphere is right now? Like how crazy are we collectively? And then the other is, you know, once you know how to Gaslight someone, then you can do that. Michael (1h 1m 57s):And in a way, these tools, I'm sure. I mean, I know that you and your colleagues have thought about the ethical implications of being able to offer this kind of an insight to people. So what are your thoughts on the evolutionary arms, race in information asymmetry and access and the literacy around this kind of a tool and what it means in terms of the agents that are undoubtedly already using this information as leverage to divide people. Because I mean, even Gregory Bateson back in the forties, when he was part of the OSS, pioneering skidmagennis in the Korean war was thinking about this stuff, you know, I mean, it's refined now. Michael (1h 2m 43s):So this is not where I necessarily want to land this conversation, but just to take it out of sort of the starry-eyed wow, we can do this to the, Oh my God, that means that we have orbital lasers and we could theoretically take someone out. What do you think? Peter (1h 2m 59s):So a lot of things, yeah, no I've worried deeply, deeply about, and this is my interest in stories, like what is happening in terms of the stories that are watching for populations that are being manufactured to spread and so on, or are being found sort of in the wild and then amplified by, you know, certain agents or whatever, maybe a little too a little bit before, but I mean, the kinds of stories we have in the U S now are not great on there. It's very divided. You really do have quite divided populous. And where does that lead in time? I'm pretty limited in my view of predictability for a little bit, we do have some stuff that you showed, but I came up with a correlelesation the other day. I mean, it's sort of, it's a little bit along those lines of some predictability, but those numbers for geopolitical risk there, and they're pretty rough. Peter (1h 3m 44s):They're pretty broad. It's not going to say there's going to be a protest in that town. There's nowhere near that kind of thing. But even if it did, I think there's, this would be good stuff to have out in the open so people can understand that this is what is being known about you. I mean, potentially about your population you live in, we're going to eventually figure it out, I suppose, but there's going to be huge limits to it. You know, we know, we understand now for the weather, right? That's a sort of a two week horizon. We get as much data as we want, you know, computational power and all that sort of stuff. But we understand from dynamical systems, we just can't tell in two weeks, like in detail, that's gonna be a limit I'm really interested in where we'll get to with that for social phenomenon. But I think it's going to be much more limited. I mean, there so many shocks that come along, their just shocks and we then talk about them in history, but people don't anticipate certain things, you know, they really don't. Peter (1h 4m 33s):So from the sort of the whole sort of the story space that's emerged. I mean, how do you help people defend themselves against all these stories coming at them? And there are different approaches that have been kind of understood, You know, I think from certain countries and cultures, like one is flood the world with stories, you know, just put out an enormous number of stories that essentially are all competing with each other. So you can't figure out what's going on. It's like denial of service from a story point of view. And so that's a powerful thing. So if we had this sort of sensing thing that could tell you, here are the stories they're coming from this place they're being fed into the system, they appeared on this TV show, but here's where they nucleated from. Peter (1h 5m 13s):No good. Right? So it's absolutely an arms race. And I think of story was you have to have stories to get people to do all sorts of things. There's any number of quotes from history, from people who sort of figured this out, I suppose. There's diversion by telling people, you know, happy stories all the time, like the American dream, right? That's a good story. Rags to riches is one of the most basic stories, you know, in terms of fundamental stories, that's it rags the riches. I know it's just like, come here and you go up the train. So cultures tell stories about themselves, you know, and I don't know what the U.S. will tell about itself in, in years to come, but it's certainly dividing it stories now that they're kind of broken. I will say, I think   **we're terrible at understand stories of collectives and there are a few reasons.  This is a systems problem, right?  This is why we struggle with systems, we're really good at individual narratives. Journalists will do this all the time. People writing books will do this all the time. They'll frame a major event around an individual so you can travel through in their shoes and get a sense for it and then maybe step out. Religious sermons do this as well, right with sort of parables and things. They tell you about individuals, we're individuals. So, but it's much harder to understand 300 million people like the collective behavior, you know, and this is why we've created all these simulations from the simple time model things to, you know, football and things. We don't have a good understanding for how people behave in large collectives. They can seem strange because it is a different thing, but we do this mistake of imprinting individuals on top, and many people will be sort of comfortable if one individual was running the whole thing, right? That manifested various ways as religions. You know, the idea that Trump is in charge or Obama was in charge. You know, there's a hand at the wheel, Leviathan, cause that fits into our limited cognitive capacity. So the stories of the many are outside of our mental frame.  What we sort of walk around with actually. We have to really train ourselves to understand that.   So one other piece here to kind of go with that is we live in a really different age from the 17 hundreds when in the U S it takes months to get information from one side of the country to the other. And of course, it's only from one sort of few individuals to a few other individuals. That's not where we are now. Peter (1h 7m 22s):Now we have live video and people in all around the world principle can watch the same thing at the same time unfold, we have media that's spread out. We have some of that media has say big, like Fox or CBS or something. You know, the big things that many people will watch, but this local news that might be local, but it's also tethered together because it's owned by the same group. You know, USA today owns a lot of different newspapers stuff to say they're a good or a bad actor, but they're not. So there's a correlation that's come about in what people see in the world, which is very different. So I come from rural Australia from a farm and we're always sort of at odds with cities, right? There's always like, Oh, the cities get all the resources that no one cares about. Peter (1h 8m 2s):They don't know what sheep or food is. You know, this is sort of that kind of battle. So, and when I sort of came to U.S. and understood this effort with the electoral college to distribute power and to put capitals in small places and so on. There's part of me that thought I can see that right. From a systems point of view, it's clever, right? It's like spreading things out a little bit and allows for innovation. John Stewart years ago called it the meth labs of democracy. But, you know, so can work in different ways, but you need them to be acting independently. So, but if these different States in the U S are acting in a correlated way in terms of the information that they consume, then you've got a really different game. Peter (1h 8m 44s):And that's really dangerous, right? The correlation of people's intakes, even though we're in this world where there is an infinite amount of information, and there's all this stuff I talk about science is going from data scarce, the data rich, right. This is a transition that if it's really a science, we'll make, you know, we talked about astrophysics early on, right. So looking with your eye, trying to figure out, you know, when people figured out amazing things in the last couple of thousand years, right. But it took us a long time to get the whole ellipse stuff sorted out, you know, and then telescopes, and then John Res you know, data scarce to data rich. So that transition, I think, you would think there's sort of this naive idea that I think a lot of people have was like, Oh, you know, we'll be able to sort of sort everything out, but of course, what emerges on top of that, you have to have these managers of information because it becomes incredibly hard, right, now you're looking for a needle in a stack of needles or one piece of hay in an enormous amount of hay, right? Peter (1h 9m 41s):Like it's just really hard. So you go to authority figures or entertainment or whatever and you can see from that. That starts to lead to many people being correlated. Hundreds of years ago, there's no way information transpose across countries, it just doesn't. So people are making their own judgements that are, it's really the Telegraph, I think, which is kind of a switch in terms of suddenly information going across at a distance. But I, you know, I see that as a grave problem, but I guess I have this hope, if we can kind of show it, look here is the tapestry of stories that are kind of floating around in the world and here's, what's being consumed. Peter (1h 10m 22s):Here's, what's being spread. Here's an origin, you know, that that could help. And I think it's really important as well, just from a public policy point of view, what what's going on, what is being discussed, what is happening? And you've tried to do a good thing. We've tried to Institute, you know, wearing a mask. We tried to Institute people doing certain things, you know, how are they talking about this kind of thing? How do I talk about this city now? Is this a better place? You know, so there's a good side. And of course the terrible side is something we have to explore. And of course think about very deeply because there are many ways for things to go wrong and people are very clever. They'll find fun ways that you don't anticipate. So we're very mindful of that, but, you know in terms of the control of people and that sort of thing, which is, you know, awful, you know, it's underway, it's happening just the rags to riches stories in your American dream. Peter (1h 11m 7s):That is, you know, it can be pretty soft. It's not like there's some, you know, person, you know, creating, you know, whatever it is, you know, sort of inserting this information to every, every person. But, you know, there is these stories that we're bound to that are for better or worse things that we, that, that got out lives. So I do kind of at times, think stories are everything right. That why we get out of bed when you kind of draw down, a lot of them are about, and I don't want to be too, like,  about survival in like kill the monster, right? That's better survival rags to riches. That's flourishing, right? This is the things are great. You know, that that's an arc. We want to see, we're very interested in the ox where things go wrong as well, because they're, you know, they're the cautionary tales, right. Peter (1h 11m 50s):But we are very preoccupied with survival and I, it gets very elaborate and we get a long way away from like the sort of roar idea of survival. But I have this way of talking about what many stories of sort of revolvers hatchings matchings and dispatching, right? These are the three main events. And so we're, you know, there's some aspect of that that's spreading around and you think of the stories that are dominating the U S now say, you know what Trump talks about, For example, a lot of them are pretty dire, right? There are some times where like the country will end many different sort of groups will sort of frame it that way. Like it's going to be the, the end. So there's that sort of, that kind of frame, which is very different to the time where things kind of building and we're kind of creating something fantastic. Peter (1h 12m 33s):And we're flourishing. So, yeah. Michael (1h 12m 36s):Thoughts on that, you know, since one of the things that you point to in this paper at the end on, like, what could we be doing better? What could we do? You know, what, where is the research to expand is gesturing at what you're talking about, which is the story taxonomy in press. If it bleeds, it leads sounds a whole lot like, well, you know, the killer whale is the Keystone species of the ecosystem and, you know, work by professor John Hart and others, you know, I've talked about the way that ecosystems are organized according to, they seem to follow the principle of maximum entropy production, right? Like a river basin, it's like the network is going to get as fractal as possible in order to minimize the turbulence at its branch points. Peter  (1h 13m 24s):I did my PhD on river networks, by the way.   Michael (1h 13m 29s):Yeah, so this, you know, again, to, you know, shout out, like we seek to, at every episode to the conversation we had with Jeff West on this particular topic. And, you know, in a way it makes it seem like it would be a danger. What I hear is for there to be too much correlation, for there to be, you know, monocropping (1h 13m 51s):The diversity of perspectives, we want a diversity of stories. And then the question is, how do we actually study this rigorously? So, you know, talking about you being from Australia, I can't help but think of the story that Aldous Huxley opens his essay, heaven and hell. Talking about how when the first European naturalists came back from Australia, and nobody believed them when they came back with a specimen of like a Platypus and they all, they had to rip it apart, autopsy it, to see if they could find riches. Peter (1h 14m 19s):So many of the others had done that. They'd made a few, you know, kind of a bad kind of a bad history there. Yeah. I'm a huge fan of the total champion animal, but then you have for predictability, you know, let's stop with a bunch of quarks, right? Hey, you've got a super corks. You're going to get a Platypus out of that. Michael (1h 14m 42s):Yeah. I think that actually, there's a Platypus in the taxonomy of the cartoon animals of the Vermont complex system center, as I recall. Michael (1h 14m 52s):Yeah. So actually suggest in that riff of his that what the world needs is a new cadre of naturalists to perform the same duty of creating a taxonomy for the contents of the human mind. And it seems like this is really what you're getting at here. And that one of the things that stands in your way that you and your coauthors address in the story Wrangler paper is the data that you do not have, which as you alluded to earlier in this conversation is like, somebody's Twitter accounts are corporate entities. Many of them are bots. They're not even human beings. Michael (1h 15m 34s):And so, you know, to get a read on the Noahphere from this is skewed, you know, like you've got a blind spot. And then also with geographical data, like presumably much of this data is available. Maybe Twitter just doesn't want to give it to you. Peter(1h 15m 52s):We actually dialed that down, you know, used to be more, I mean, not great, but it used to be there and you could do something with it, but it's actually been doubted, which I look, I think that's to their credit, to their credit. Like researchers might be like upset, but no, I mean, they're making a service and I think that's actually smart of them to do that. So you're right. So geo is a little less is hazy and we've stepped away from, we've gone for language. So there's a hundred languages. Michael (1h 16m 18s):Right? So that's not exactly a perfect fit because it's kind of two different questions, but like one is about the lacunae in your data and what kind of questions that bags. And then the other is how you're starting to tease apart this panoply of fantastical things that you're discovering and what a taxonomy of story is starting to look like in a rigorous or can you even start that? Peter (1h 16m 49s):No taxonomy of story is, is this, I don't know. I see that as a grand, a grand achievement of science, and look, it would vary from culture to culture and over time, but just being able to do that well, there've been efforts for a long time and there was an early efforts with them folk tales, which are, you know, and so that more bespoke by hand, you know, magical animals and the magical trees, you know, there's sort of this list of things, but trying to do that in a data driven way, I think is this great, great challenge for us? So it's kind of coming, but I would say, you know, yes, Twitter is this limited thing also it's enormous. So we're sort of, you know, it takes a lot of work to contend with it, but we've really tried to look at other different corporates, sort of see, you know, spread out. Peter (1h 17m 32s):So Reddit is another one, books are another one, of course there's video and pictures, or there's just enormous other array. It is painstaking work. You have to be incredibly careful with this. Know what I mean? Maybe we've messed things up, but we've tried so hard to count everything and be really careful with this because yeah, it's tough. So I think that the errors are not always really in the analysis they're just in the corporate themselves, that you've chosen. Of course, I mean just to sort of say that ups quite obviously but then they are also in your instruments as well. So the hedonometer for example, the way that works is we have a list of words that have scores attached to them on the happiness sadness spectrum, and what changes things is not really the scores, you know, the scores could be moved around a little bit. Peter (1h 18m 24s):It's just which words are in the list. It's kind of like, are you looking through a red filter or a green filter? You know, if you're looking at colors or is it a bad lens, you know, that changes the story. But I will say one of the things that's helped me particularly kind of move along with this is when we've thought to improve something by getting more data and improving an instrument in what feels like a way that you might improve a physical instrument. Right? So we, we made telescopes, we made better lenses, you know, and it took a lot of time. And then 10 years later we make a better one with more, you know, the curvature is, you know, more accurate and so on. Peter (1h 19m 4s):We've been able to do that with language. And so that's what we've done say with the hedonometer, a larger list of words that fits natural language better and having scores for it. It didn't give us a completely different picture, right. So there was this concern that I had early on that we would change the instrument, like try to improve it and everything we saw before would go away, you know, there'll be all kinds of wrong, but actually we could still see that, but we started to see much more definition. So it had that kind of improvement, which is, Oh, now we can see more finely in this photograph in front of us. And so that was a good experience. Peter (1h 19m 44s):Right. It makes me feel like some of what we're doing is a bit more like physical instruments, that they were charitable parameters associated with them, which is kind of like, you know, having a focal thing on the side anyway. Peter (1h 20m 3s):How do we tell these stories.  Theres a whole bunch of conspiracy stuff about flat earth or, you know, Q Anon kind of things like how do we start to kind of tease them apart and, and see where they started? You know, time is this enormous thing for us, right? It's the big, the big sorting index. So just seeing when a word or a term comes into being is pretty powerful so even if we're using Twitter with something else, that's going to be this pretty good background information source. So Q Anon, for example, when does that emerge? And like hashtag you know, where we go one we go all and that sort of thing. Peter (1h 20m 44s):Like you can just see what pops up. So then you could go to other corporate as well, or media sources and kind of try to analyze things there.  One of the stories that people tell, do people give up on stories at some point, you know, there's the rags to riches stories we've talked about for the American dream, you know, that can be broken, you know, things go wrong for you and maybe that breaks, maybe you move to a different story. Maybe you become more tied to a religious group that's more community oriented and helping and so on. I mean, how do people move around and kind of the stories of their lives and their communities, you know, the stories just about themselves versus everyone else. Peter (1h 21m 28s):And you know, there are the, of course, the stories that we like to read, you know, there's that whole world as well, you know, which ones animators, you know, and there's marketing on top of that. There are there sort of just standard stories that people will come back for. Right. I mean the Avengers or something like that. Michael (1h 21m 49s):Thinking of Simon today, I would just coauthored that piece from probability to consilience. You know, the base therom. And like you said, there's the different kinds of simplicity that we seek. So it's that sort of speaks to your, you know, which stories are persistent or the stories that, you know, like insectivores survive a mass extinction. Anyway. Peter (1h 22m 19s):Yeah. Which stories do you miss completely? You know, we're pretty, we're kind of funny when it comes to probabilistic stuff and randomness. Right. Sometimes we're good with it, but often it's completely bemusing to us or we miss it. Or we see some sort of random behavior and we tell a story about it. And I think sometimes that's a pretty good survival trait of sorts because, you know, there's this old sort of notion of it's good to make the mistake of seeing a rock or some sort of twig in the woods as a tiger. Right. You know, cause we think that thing has agency, but I would sort of, I would reframe that as saying what we see as a story, right? Peter (1h 23m 3s):We mistake this and because stories are dynamic things, right. They're there there's time and something happens and then they can be just a little plots and they told them different ways. So this is the plot, which is the mechanic. And the story is the telling of it, you know, Proverbs are stories, right. The algorithms are stories, they, lots of things can be seen in that way. But yeah, we see this tiger is going to come out and eat us and we imagine that, right. We run that little scenario. We run that little story. If we see a rock, we don't run from it.  You can talk about agency and all those things, but what we're running all this all the time are these little possible paths and which one do we want to be on? Peter (1h 23m 47s):And we're trying to guess that about other people, what paths are they taking? What paths is your community taking, what paths are the world taking?   Michael:I feel like we could continue to delve into this and I would love to for a while, but I think that we've already kind of consigned ourselves to this being a two-parter. So I don't know, Peter, this has been truly fascinating. I wonder whether this is now seared into my memory or whether I'm going to just be, you know, washed aside by the next sort of piece of sensational news. Peter (1h 24m 28s):But I suspect that given all the editing, this will require, I'll be thinking about this conversation for some time. Do you, do you have any parting thoughts for people? You know, I mean, we've covered so much ground here, but are there trails through this wood of connected ideas that we have not traversed that you find worth identifying, pointing to people as they walk out of this conversation perhaps, or where would you direct people if they want to think about these things more deeply beyond of course your work. The dashboards and the papers we'll link to in the show notes. Peter  (1h 25m 11s):Yeah. It's interesting you bring up the path through the woods. Phillip Pullman has that when he talks about sort of a notion that he, actually I had this book, it was just on writing and stories and I was kind of delighted to hear him talk about that. Right. But his view of that was you have to find that path through as a storyteller. Right. And I have my own separate stuff there and I think about adjacent stories in adjacent narratives. Right. And this is the problem I think for stories and for science in general. So let me just say this, this is I think an important thing, because we haven't really talked about the truth. Peter (1h 25m 52s):Right. You know, I don't think there are alternate worlds at all. There's what happened and there are true things, that's why the lights stay on. Right. And all this sort of stuff. Right. So, but the truth has been de-legitimized in so many ways. So somehow we have to remore ourselves collectively to the truth. So that's the great challenge, I think, now it's an ongoing challenge forever. And I will say, I think the problem we have as scientists and as journalists, my wife's a journalist and I think of journalists as scientists with a deadline and scientist are journalist without one, trying to tell what happened and try to explain it. Peter (1h 26m 39s):Right. So there is what happened and adjacent to that will be a better story. It will be a story that might be better just simply to tell, right. You know, there's everything that happened in this event. Even if you want to be a good journalist, you've got, you know, you're gonna write three paragraphs, so you have to distill it and break it down. Or even if you have video, you got to break it down so that it's already going to be removed a little bit from exactly what happened. But then if you're a bad actor, you can work to find a story adjacent to this one that serves your posts that fits your overall narrative. Or you could find many and start to put them out. And just so they seeds out. Peter (1h 27m 19s):So I think we have to protect the truth. We have to keep developing the truth, like reinforcing it, protecting it. This is the great challenge. I think the really hard problem for us is that there are beautiful stories adjacent to true stories that spread better, that people will believe much more easily because they didn't have the weird random thing that happened in the real story. You know, real stories can have, you know, stuff that we'd want to iron out. So that is a challenge for us. So not to fall too far into beautiful stories. True stories, they're gonna have some messiness in it. That stuff Peter (1h 27m 59s):is hard to explain perhaps, but we need to figure out how we can, you know, this is what science does, but we've lost it culturally. We need to get that back or reclaim it for the first time ever. Michael (1h 28m 13s):Yeah. I think about with Sabine Hoston Felder gave that talk. The SFI community lectures about Does Beauty Lead Mathematics Astray. And again, the thing about this is when our, our desire for simplicity goes from being a virtue to a vice where we pursue the beautiful story at the cost of truth. Peter (1h 28m 32s):So truth and beauty, not connected. I do not presume them to be connected at all. The truth can be told beautifully and that's our challenge, right? We have to tell scientific truth beautifully so that they can compete, you know, and its still the truth. But we have to tell them in beautiful ways, ways that people want to spread them so that they can compete with, you know, these mouse stories, these wrong stories. Michael (1h 28m 58s):Well, that's an awesome place to end it. I feel very validated in my science communication career by this conversation. Thank you, Peter it's was just awesome to talk to you. I love these, these wandering discursive ambles through the landscape of the mind, you are an excellent guide through that landscape and I hope that people found this as interesting as I did and that they go, and they twiddle around with the dashboards that you and your team have created, because it is immensely curious to turn the telescope back down upon the human species and to gawk at what strange creatures we are and what we look like in aggregate. Michael (1h 29m 47s):Thank you so much for being here today.   Peter:Absolutely wonderful. I enjoyed it greatly. So thank you so much. Michael (1h 29m 57s):Thank you for listening.

Human edits by Shirley Bekins & Rayyan Zahid.-----ARTEMY KOLCHINSKY:I'm sitting here and there's constantly the molecules of air bouncing into me from all around and so for that reason, the molecules in my body are becoming correlated with the molecules in the room and that's information being transferred from the room to me, but that's not meaningful at all. That's just sort of ubiquitous correlations. On the other hand, you know, if I see a car coming towards me when I'm walking down the street, the way my nervous system and body is set up is that I use that correlation to jump out of the way and maintain myself. And so by virtue of how I'm structured certain information acquires meaning for me, it might tell me where there's food or where there's danger and it becomes very different from just correlations.And so I think one of the things that I'm interested in is, you know, as I was saying, there's these kinds of new subfield in physics, stochastic thermodynamics, which a lot of what it looks at is energy requirements of acquiring and processing and using information. You know, it really doesn't make a distinction between this kind of meaningful, or you might say functional information, or just an empty correlation. MICHAEL GARFIELD:Matter, energy and information, the Holy Trinity of physics understanding the relations between these measures of our world is one of the big questions of complex systems science. The laws of thermodynamics tell us that entropy, loosely but somewhat inaccurately speaking disorder, increases in any closed material system. But at the same time, living systems generally not closed, constantly pump out entropy, thereby keeping themselves alive by harnessing flows of energy and information. We know that physical systems gain or lose energy as heat. But what is the difference between exchanging heat and exchanging signals with information relevant to a system’s continued existence? In other words, when is information meaningful, when do goals and meaning come into play and how do a system’s constraints and embodiment figure in? Understanding how to formalize the interactions of our jostling cosmos and reveal the engine of emergent order is the quest of all quests. Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast for the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield. And every two weeks, we'll bring you with us for far-ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks, to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week, we speak with SFI program postdoctoral fellow Artemy Kolchinski who studies how information is organized and processed in biological, neural, and physical systems. In recent publications with SFI professor David Wolpert, Artemy explores fundamental constraints on the energy required to process information and seeks to define semantic information, or information bearing meaningful content.Our conversation takes us on a winding path into a thick dark wood in which meet trails cut by cybernetics, cognitive science, statistical physics, and astrobiology. TIS’ the season.

Thank you for listening. Artemy Kolchinski! This is long overdue, multiply rescheduled. I'm just delighted to have you finally on Complexity podcasts.ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:Thank you, Michael. It's fated to be eventually.MICHAEL GARFIELD:You're in a very squeaky chair, but we'll make it work. That's actually kind of like perfect because it's information I'm sensing about the environment, right? Noise. Anyway, let's get into first because your work is so dense and labyrinthian and curious and ambitious. And I'm really in awe frankly, of the kind of questions that you're tilting after, almost a Quixotic quest to get at some of the deepest stuff here, but I'd love to know how you got into science in the first place.What drew you into these inquiries at all? You know, how did you end up at SFI? This is where we typically like to set the launch pad for these conversations.ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:Right, well, thank you that was a very flattering description, overly, maybe a bit. But I think my interest in science definitely started because my father is a biologist and so...molecular biologist And so I didn't necessarily grow up thinking I was going to be a scientist at all, but as I was growing up, I remember we would get into these conversations where he would just kind of just explain to me what we know about how the cell works and how biology works at the nanoscale. And I remember this intense feeling of wonderment at how complicated everything is and just bewilderment at how, where this came from, how it could have been constructed, how it all seems to work together.And it was very captivating discussions we had. I mean, I think that, you know, that definitely sparked a certain interest in science. And I was also kind of a computer nerd growing up. I taught myself to program. I love playing with computers. And when I got to college, I actually didn't know what I was going to study. I was kind of a bit of a lost... in many ways but, and I started just kind of, with no major, very general program. And I was kind of bored and it was not a very good education. And I remember at some point I switched into this program in my college, which was New York University.And they have a school in it called Gallatin School of Individualized Study where basically you can study whatever you want, as long as it's interdisciplinary and all over the place. And quite a few of my friends were in it. And I don't know, it seemed very freeform. And you know, you didn't have to go to these 300-person massive lectures, the core courses and stuff. So I entered that. And then towards the end of my undergraduate studies, I kind of like randomly browsing through the library stacks. I came across this shelf of books that was all about kind of like SFI stuff.So there was a book about artificial life and there was a book... It was also...I think in the library, I remember coming across a book about artificial life and there's also a book about artificial consciousness or something. And I was totally fascinated by this. Also, it was just like a very random encounter and fascinated by this little, you know, aisle of pop science and also at that time, so this is the early 2000s when complexity really, it was kind of big in the pop science world and Barabasi’s’ book Linked came out and Steven Johnson's book on emergence came out this, you know, it was also being applied in all kinds of domains, Smart Mobs, that book by Lessig, I think, came out.And so I started getting really into all this kind of pop science. I read Complexity by Waldrop and I got really into complexity and this idea of emergence and kind of very much the pop science version of it. This, you know, this, this notion of that neuron is not conscious, but a collection of neurons is, and, you know, you get qualitatively new properties when you combine large numbers of things and so on. And I got really also, like I became kind of a SFI fanboy, I guess, and became really interested in this place. And it's actually interesting. I think I applied to the summer school, like at the end of my undergrad, but I didn't get in and like many things at the time I think I wrote my like submission essay, you know, at five in the morning, like the morning before it was due. And a year or two ago I randomly came across it on my hard drive and I pulled it up and it was so bad, like, Oh, wow I clearly wrote this at five in the morning, you know, the day before it's due. Anyway, so that was kind of how I first got interested in SFI. It's not necessarily how I ended up here. Then after my undergrad, I went traveling for a couple of years. And again, I got really into kind of academic and scholarly activities and “A” life and this kind of stuff. But then in my undergrad, I didn't necessarily think it was going to be a career or anything like that.And it also helped that I knew how to program, and it was quite, you know, that's kind of how I made money for a lot of years programming. So that also helped kind of get into that field of study because of course, what SFI does is from the beginning, it was very computational, and it's closely tied to computational methods. And I went traveling after undergrad for a few years, and I kinda got bored with things, and I decided to apply for grad school. And I went to basically like the only grad program that had really a PhD in complex systems, which was Indiana University Bloomington, at least to my knowledge, and at least in the broad sense. So really not sort of complex systems in terms of like complex materials tied to physics, but really networks, but also like complexity and biology and so on.And during my PhD, I got really into information theory and information theory as a kind of universal language. A lot of complex systems is about seeing common patterns in very many different systems and information theory seemed like a very powerful language for doing that and for studying, kind of organization in general, or pattern in general. And so a lot of my PhD or at least towards the end was about using techniques from information theory to try to study complex systems or developing new methods. And it was quite methodsy, I would say, my PhD and I feel like I've been talking for a while, maybe too long. (laugh) MICHAEL GARFIELD:You're good. This is good. Keep going.ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll just keep going. MICHAEL GARFIELD:You know, this is a deep dark wood we're entering here with a long winding road into it. So it just gets less and less... ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:Ok, ok, I'll just keep talking. I mean probably everyone is asleep at this point or anyway, and then the other thing I became quite interested in towards the end of my undergrad had actually, I sort of randomly sat in on this graduate course on cognitive science, which seemed interesting. And it seemed closely related to cybernetics, which was something I got really into during my undergrad. This is kind of forgotten pre-complexity, complexity theory. And one of the other things I got really interested in during my PhD studies was the cognitive science program at Indiana University in Bloomington, which is particularly known, it’s kind the origin of a particular kind of approach to cognitive science, which is sometimes called dynamical systems approach to cognition. And to simplify it a bit, it really tries to move away from a model or a metaphor of cognition as being like a computer, or like being a computer program, which, you know, it's tied to certain currents in philosophy of mind and in philosophy about representations and beliefs and ideas. And it's hard to understand how to sort of naturalize that or to connect to this traditional sort of approach to cognitive science. It's harder to connect it to other domains of natural science. The dynamical systems approach really sees cognition as basically adaptive behaviors. The ability to achieve certain goals by a dynamical system, which is both the body and possibly nervous system, but also in combination with certain environments in which the system is situated. And in some ways it really sees cognition as being present in even the simplest organisms. So it's much closer to how people study behavior or functionality or information transfer in all kinds of, for example, biological systems, including single cells.And it lets us talk about, for example, information processing and even adaptive information processing without bringing in a lot of these really philosophically loaded terms that have a lot of baggage, like for example, representation, belief, desire, and so on. And so that was a big influence on me sort of being in contact with those ideas in Indiana and particularly Randall Beer is somebody who does really amazing work there and influenced me quite a bit. And then slowly winding my way to SFI. When I finished my PhD, I sort of was unsure how to proceed. I had some qualms about academia, which I think is pretty common after the emotional work of doing a PhD.And I kind of, we just hung out for a little while and I ended up going to the Conference on Complex Systems, which happened that year in Tempe, Arizona. And I ran into David Wolpert who was giving a talk and I'd never met David before, but his talk was very provocative. I had some thoughts and I kind of chatted with him about it. And one thing led to another, we had a ton of interests in common and he invited me to visit SFI. And then I kind of got hired for a short period of time. And then we applied for some grants. And anyway, here I am four years later or something at SFI where I've been working with David. And the things that I've been working with David on, and really the thing that sort of I started doing since coming to SFI was using some of my existing knowledge of information theory and some of my other skills, but also combining that with this new kind of rapidly expanding subfield of statistical physics, which is called stochastic thermodynamics. It really looks at the thermodynamics of usually small fluctuating non-equilibrium systems. And it's very closely tied to information theory. It really, you could maybe say, it's almost like a reformulation of statistical physics almost entirely in terms of information theory and that might be a slightly controversial way to put it.And it's very interesting. It sort of lets us analyze a lot of things rigorously that were kind of impossible to analyze before from a physical dynamical perspective, including for me, one of the most interesting things is the physics of systems that acquire information and process information and use that information. This could be like little computer chips. It could be like biological organisms. It could even be, you know, some kind of proto cells that have a flow of information through them and maybe use that information to do things like acquire food, acquire energy and so on. And so these are the topics that I've been working with David quite a bit on it. And really in a sense, they're sort of adding a somewhat physical perspective to a lot of these interests that I've had for awhile in particular, trying to understand things like minimally cognitive systems, you know, what are the constraints on those?What is a good way to model them and to understand them and even things like autopoiesis, which is this idea that there's sort of a fundamental pattern that characterizes living things and that really distinguishes living things. And yeah, I think I'll stop there for now. That's the spiel. So that's kind of how I got to where I am now. And also the kinds of things that I like to think about.MICHAEL GARFIELD:Right on. Yeah, a lot of this is very resonant with me. I don't know, without knowing the year of your alma mater, I think you and I seem like we were kind of reading the same books and on the same trajectory, and then you just had a much more sort of hospitable environment that knew what to do with you. I mean, around that same time, I remember bringing this type of question to my advisors and they were just like, Define complexity for me. I dare you! You know, like you're going to have to bury big questions like this until you get tenure. There's no way that someone's going to allow you to charge after these things that as a graduate student, you're very fortunate, but at the same time, you know, I was really lucky. I don't know if you know the book Evolution as Entropy, Edward Wiley at the University of Kansas. ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI: I don’t.MICHAEL GARFIELD: He was one of the people I spoke to about this. And it seems like his stuff is really, it's just strange. I don't know, you know, it just maybe a dispositional thing that you kept with it, but so one of the questions that I love that you are so eager to explore in your work and that I've just been wondering about rather fruitlessly for the last 15 years instead is, is this question about the relationship between energy, matter and information. And then as you alluded to just a moment ago, the way that information suggests a kind of sensation of the environments, you know, the cognitive act is an act of making sense of things.I guess you might say in a way, I mean, you can, you can check me on any of this, but…ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI: Makes sense to me. Good one!MICHAEL GARFIELD: I mean, yeah. You know I love David Krakauer’s talks when he shows the math behind evolutionary adaptation and inferential guesswork, inference. It's the same underlying mathematics. And so there's the sense in which evolution as a distributed process of a system navigating its super system or whatever. And so where do you strike into this as someone who is working in statistical thermodynamics?One of the things that I guess maybe the right place to start would be with your paper on semantic information that you did with David Wolpert. That piece, that's really important, I think because the common intuition for people is that information has content and that's what makes it information. And that's very much a cybernetics, Gregory Bateson, the “difference that makes a difference” kind of thing. It's information because it's about something, it's relevant in some way. And so how are you formalizing this? How are you decomposing this and making useful specifications? And then where do those lead you? ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:Right, sorry for the squeaky chair. Let me just squeak it all out now. So a couple of thoughts. I mean, one of the things you brought up is that this is pretty heady, big issues, this relationship between matter and information and cognition and life and so on. And I just wanted to make one comment about that. Since I've been at SFI and really had a chance to learn more about physics and kind of, it's been a bit of a journey and one of the beautiful things and one of the reasons for the success of physics-type thinking is sort of trying to boil things down to the simplest model that really focuses on the core issues or highlights the core issues and disregards everything else.I know it's a bit of a cliche, but I think even in this case, that’s sort of how I've been trying to ground things and I've been thinking about it and I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I do think that my way to proceed without getting vertigo is to try to and it's something I've kind of been thinking about lately is to try to come up with a simple model. It could be like a set of chemical reactions or something like that that really captures the basics of maybe like a self-sustaining autocatalytic system that also is using information to sustain itself that also, you know, it has exchanges of matter and energy that are represented. So it's just that we can really analyze and build intuitions from, and understand how these things relate.And I think that's also one of the things that I saw kind of happening in Bloomington. And I mentioned Randall Beers, something he did was build these minimal models of really these tiny neural networks that were kind of dynamical systems that could do a lot of interesting behaviors that people thought you needed representations for. So, really using these minimal models to touch, maybe say something relevant even to philosophy, right. Or so build these minimal models that could do things like relational categorization, Is one of these things bigger than another one? And you know, these are kind of classic debates in cognitive science. Oh no, like surely you need a full-on symbolic reasoning to do things like that. Well, no, not really. I mean, there's no reason to think of it. So that's kind of the way I try to circumscribe these things so it doesn't just like spiral out of control and then the other thing you mentioned, and which is really related to what we're talking about is this notion of semantic information as me and David called it in a paper and just this notion of the relationship between information and cognition and making sense of the world and, you know, perception, sensation, etc. And I think, in some sense there's a really important distinction to make.And this is one of the distinctions I hope we sort of pushed and something I want to keep pushing in the future, is in some sense, information is ubiquitous throughout the physical world. So just in physics when things interact, they tend to become correlated. There's a kind of a famous thought experiment. I forget who it's by, it's by Wheeler or somebody like that. He says the gravitational field of a single electron being present or absent on the edge of the galaxy will change whether collision happens in a box of gas within less than a second, because it's a highly chaotic system. And even that astronomically small gravitational pull of an electron makes a difference.And so in a way that's a difference that makes a difference. I mean, in the literal sense, right? Whether an electron is there or not makes a difference, whether let's say an atom collides with another atom or not, but this is spreading through everywhere. It's ubiquitous, everything is kind of correlated, but I think that something much more interesting happens, for example, in living things where it's not just that things are correlated, which is this notion of two things being correlated sometimes called syntactic information. It completely doesn't depend on their meeting. You know, the fact that an atom missed colliding with another atom in a box of gas, and the fact that that's correlated with the presence of an electron, it doesn't necessarily have any kind of meaning.And in this paper, I mean, David defined semantic information, which is sometimes taken to be information that has meaning whatever that means in a very particular way. So we said that, you know, a piece of information, so basically a correlation has meaning for a system if the system uses that correlation to maintain itself in existence. So for example, I'm sitting here and there's constantly the molecules of air bouncing into me from all around. So for that reason, the molecules in my body are becoming correlated with the molecules in the room and that's information being transferred from the room to me, but that's not meaningful at all. That's just sort of ubiquitous correlations. So on the other hand, you know, if I see a car coming towards me, when I'm walking down the street, the way my nervous system and body is set up is that I use that correlation to jump out of the way and maintain myself. And so by virtue of how I'm structured certain information acquires meaning for me, it might tell me where there's food or where there's danger and it becomes very different from just correlations. And so I think one of the things that I'm interested in is, you know, as I was saying, there's this kind of new subfield in physics, stochastic thermodynamics, which a lot of what it looks at is energy requirements of acquiring and processing and using information. You know, it really doesn't make a distinction between this kind of meaningful, or you might say functional information, or just an empty correlation.MICHAEL GARFIELD:Okay. Yes. So, yes. So there's, forgive me for uttering the taboo here, but I mean, this suggests the kind of endogenous telos, right? This is the thing that I feel like people at the periphery of this conversation get really confused about, like this idea that yes, evolution does not have a direction. Okay. Or, you know, the universe in whole is running from order into disorder, but you know, you look at it and it's actually all of these nested systems. And like you said, you know, they have different structural properties and depending on how course your grain, at what level you focus, then you will see an opposite story that there is, like you said earlier, a goal orientation.And so I know that you have been thinking recently about how this relates to the origins of life and you know, the search for life on other worlds. And it's interesting to ask in the framing of stochastic thermodynamics, where is the point at which we can say that a goal emerges? And is that the same as saying that this is the point at which meaning emerges at least from within the system, again, to draw on Varela and Maturana’s autopoiesis, that notion that these are systems making sense of their environments? What do you feel like your insights are into that?It sounds from the conversations we've had on this show so far that it's not useful anymore. It's actually misleading for us to think of there being a moment at which the light comes on and there's life suddenly out of non-life. But what are we talking about when we talk about a gradient? Is that the same thing as like a gradient of non meaning to meaning or non…?ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean these are interesting questions and to sidestep the philosophical quagmires a little bit, I started to prefer to take a very operational view of these things. And what I mean by that is to say, and what the approach we took in, in the semantic information paper was to say, look, let's just treat the system basically as if its goal is to self-preservation as if its goal is to maintain itself out of equilibrium and maintain itself as an organized entity. But, you know, I certainly don't want to say that there's some other kind of teleological force additional to mechanistic forces or something like that.On the other hand, you know, if we observed something like a chemotactic bacteria navigating its environment is certainly a very helpful compressed description of its behavior to say that it has certain goals and it acts to further those goals. I think you know, for me, it's sort of, we can say it's kind of a way of speaking, but it's also, you can make it very operational. We can say, if we knock out this gene, for example, what breaks and how does that let's say hurt the bacteria’s ability to maintain itself alive? Well, you know, we can then say the function of that gene, which is of course is a very goal directed language, right?What is the function of something is to do, to do blank. We can say the function of that gene is to allow it to digest lactose or whatever. So I, you know, and biology, it's certainly very helpful to talk as if things have goals. And I think that can even extend beyond biology. So, you know, we might say something like a hurricane is a self-maintaining non-equilibrium structure. It's stable, it funnels energy from the warm ocean to the cooler atmosphere and in doing so it constantly is  rebuilding itself. Well, I think we can sort of analyze it as if its goal is self-maintenance and see maybe how different aspects of it structure, like the eye of the hurricane or whatever, contribute to that.And I think we can do that without again delving into the philosophical quagmires, which I think Kant wrote a lot about this. I mean he was very scientifically literate and he wrote a lot about how organisms really seem to have goals. Well, he was kind of, I'm not saying that there's teleological forces, you know, final causes, but it certainly seems like they have goals for themselves. And this kind of this paradox that maybe it's just, they lend themselves so well to that description. I mean but it really, it's a difficult philosophical territory. And what I would say is like, let's just treat them as if they have goals and let's analyze it in that way.And so, going back to meaning I think even maybe a hurricane has a tiny little bit of meaning. I don't actually know much about hurricanes, but we could imagine maybe if a hurricane could preferentially move towards warmer waters instead of just being shoved around by the winds, then it could maintain itself for longer. So, maybe we could say it's using some kind of information about where warmer stuff is, where there's more energy to feed it to maintain itself. I mean, I think, it's a bit of a stretch, but I think it's less of a stretch if we maybe start to talk about things like protocells right, which are little chemical hurricanes that are maintaining themselves and are thought to have laid before the origin of modern life, but already have some things like simple metabolism and simple self-maintenance. And we can say, well, okay, well we can easily imagine one of these protocells could maybe sense what's going on in its environment and respond in different ways to its environment and, and thereby maintain itself around for longer. And that might have a little bit of more meaning, more useful functional information than let's say a hurricane.And you get to things like mammals or animals in general, which have these incredibly sophisticated nervous systems that are very tuned, precisely to pick up a huge amount of meaningful information from the environment, right? Where the food is, where the mates are, where the danger is and have this kind of huge amount of functional information flowing through them. So, I would definitely agree with you. I think it's very much a continuum. And I think one of the things that we've been thinking about is even like, how could you define quantitative measures of meaning? MICHAEL GARFIELD: So, in that line of questions. The hurricane has no sensory organs, right? Whereas you and I obviously do. And in fact, even beyond that, there is this sense, again, drawing on cybernetics and the work of people like Marshall McLuhan, like media theory, talking about the electronic surround as an extension of the human nervous system. There's a sense in which the history of science itself can be understood as the evolution of new instruments. We were talking with Peter Dodds on the last episode of this podcast, about the way that we're able to use text modeling and timeline analysis from social media, as a way peering into the collective mentation of the human species.And that's like the latest example of this trajectory of us developing ever more nuanced and sophisticated tools of sensing our environment. And so, I'd love to hear you talk a little bit more about that specifically about this whole matter energy information relationship and how it plays out in what seemed to me at least to be evolutionary arms races in the evolution of new sensory equipment.This is something I was thinking a lot about seven years ago when Google glass came out and it was, it very swiftly seemed like one of these haves or haves not kind of things. Like, are you going to be technologically augmented? Are you going to be able to look at somebody and pull up their biographical information and you'll have an edge on them? And that feels a lot like what was happening with the evolution of the eye in the Cambrian explosion over 500 million years ago. And that there's a continuity here that the evolution of intelligence is the evolution of sensory abilities and that there's, a co-evolutionary dance going on that's constantly ratcheting these things as living in a more intelligent and sensorily empowered, sensory motor sophisticated environment has a higher demand on a system and in terms of its ability to navigate it.How do you, technologically augmented 21st century SFI postdoc make sense of all of this and where is the underlying uniformity there? ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:One of the things I would say is like, do we really know a hurricane doesn't have a sensory organ? And what I mean by that is it's not always clear what is, and is not a sensory organ. So, for example, there is a model of protocells where there's no explicit sensory organ for sensing the direction of food, but just because like where the food comes from, the membrane grows faster on that side effectively, you end up moving towards the food, right. Or for, in a bacterium we think of the flagella as a way to move around, but it's also actually used to sense the environment because it interacts with the world and it can actually send information back and forth. So, I don't think that's contradicting anything you said, but I kind of want to point out that I think the separation of the system into specialized sensory and effectory organs, which actually, I'm not totally sure how separated they are, right? Like the hand is both very sensory and very effectory in people, but given even then having specialized effectors and sensors might be kind of a recent thing or even a special thing. This is something I want to explore, but I suspect that even simple things like stochastic chemical networks have some minimal, essentially sensory abilities in the sense that for example chemical systems have all kinds of correlations running through them. As I said, when things just interact with each other, they build up correlations. The information is there, you just have to use it to do something functional? So that was my first point. The second point is that I think you bring up a really interesting point about development of specialized sensory organs, and that can actually trigger a whole new entrance into new niches and a new sort of evolutionary landscape. Once you develop eyes, now you can start to become selected on how well you hunt. So, it's like you add dimensions of behavior by being able to sense new things and you kind of expand. I think it's a very kind of good example of adding complexity almost in like a qualitative way. But I don't know if I have much to say about all that scientifically, at least in terms of what I was talking about, because one of the things about this new field of non-nuclear school of physics, and their relationships with human matter information and energy, is in general, these relationships are meaningful. Not all, but in general they tend to be at the molecular scale or the level of very small energy fluctuations. And they sort of set fundamental bounds as determined by physics. And one of the big questions is, and lots of people are kind of skeptical, that do they have something to say about the energy trade-offs involved in the mammalian brain or any brain for that matter because brains operate very, very far from these limits. It's kind of like trying to apply quantum physics to explain why I went to get lunch. It's like, we have to be really careful because at macroscopic scales, these quantum effects, they really disappear. The world is mostly classical and is kind of a mistake to think that it applies. And at least it seems like many of these really fundamental relationships between information, energy and matter are mostly meaningful at the scale of molecular systems, at least in my point of view. And that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in trying to apply them to things like protocells, origin of life, because protocells are very small. There's a good chance they were very small in terms of maybe thousands or tens or hundreds of thousands of atoms. And I actually think that these fundamental relationships might have played a big part in like very, very early trade-offs in very early evolution. I'm not sure, like non-equilibrium physical physics has something to say about the complexification of life via development of new sensory organs in general, at least at the fundamental scale of universal laws, which is basically what I'm talking about. These are like universal laws, the second law of thermodynamics. It's a question. And I kind of talked earlier about what I've been thinking about is the minimal model to work out these relationships and the minimum model I'm thinking of most of the time is something like molecular, where these quantities make sense. You know, so a good rule of thumb is that a lot of these quantities are expressed in units of KT. And KT is like the size of an energy fluctuation, basically at temperature T. At room temperature the energy of KT is like 500th of the energy released by the burning of a single sugar molecule. So that's kind of the scale where a lot of these things are expressed then. MICHAEL GARFIELD::I don't know if this is a challenge to that or but to bounce to the complete opposite end from the microcosm to the macrocosm, this question about the limits imposed upon evolutionary processes by thermodynamics begs the question about what your research might say about the work that's being done elsewhere throughout the SFI research network, on scaling laws and the developmental constraints on evolution. And why it is that we only see certain kinds of life forms out of everything that we might imagine. We had Melanie Moses on the show, and we were talking about the moment at which the growth of an insect, and then the emergence of a social insect colony, like ants or bees represents a kind of phase transition in the computation being passed from the system at one level to a new sort of meta individuality at the next level, as a way of overcoming some of these scaling constraints. And it seems like your work really sheds light on that kind of a question. And so, I'm curious what your thoughts are even though you're talking about the amount of heat generated by molecular interactions. What do you think is possible at the scale of human civilization, or at the scale of the biosphere? What are the invisible limits to growth, we just sort of assume they're not there because we don't see them, but it seems like this would cast some light on that.ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:I will qualify my statement a bit, and this is something I've been recently talking to Chris Campus about who is a faculty at SFI who works a lot on scaling and it's related to some work Chris did with David earlier is I don't mean to say that these fundamental relationships between energy and information, don't matter for modern life. And in particular where you think that they matter a lot for the ribosome, which is a little molecular machine that makes proteins in every cell and where most of the energy is used in a cell ,more than half for bacteria, it's been incredibly optimized. And it's this incredible machine that's basically organizing matter as it runs along. So, it reads off RNA, it strings together amino acids to make proteins. It's really like building your machine. And it's actually probably highly constrained by the second law of thermodynamics because it's been optimized to death. And it's kind of like the most important machine in life maybe. And that's inside every cell of every organism, except for some exceptions. At the same time at the micro level. as you get bigger, there's other constraints, including other physical constraints that come into play. If you're a bear and you catch a salmon and it's very far away from KT, of course, ultimately that's feeding down to your cells, which are working at KT, the kinds of pressures and constraints that might characterize how much salmon a bear needs and how much energy it can get out of it, our new laws start to enter. Even though we think the whole universe is just one big quantum thing, we don't expect the universal laws of quantum physics to explain everything. And even though they are universal, that's kind of one of the central ideas of complexity and emergence, as you get qualitatively new laws, you get qualitatively new explanations, you get new vocabulary that you have to use and new types of vocabulary. And so, I guess that, that's why I was pushing back a little bit. I don't necessarily think even though these are universal relationships and they're really interesting, that they do say something about why a group of insects evolves eusociality. I think that could be just explained by other ideas from evolutionary pressures, from group selection, kin selection, endosymbiotic, and all of these revolutionary ideas. And in some sense, I think evolution is a much more multi-scale principle because you can really, as long as there's a heritable variation and fitness, can kind of apply evolutionary thinking and it's different forms. MICHAEL GARFIELD:Let's pin back a little bit because there's another pre-print that you just did with David Wolpert on "Work, entropy production and the thermodynamics of information under protocol constraints". And we kind of skipped over this a little bit in this conversation, but if we're going to talk about the relevance to civilization, this has a lot to do to my understanding with how efficient we can make our inquiries of the world. It seems like this sheds light on the bounds of how efficient an organism can be or a battery or what you can actually accomplish with computers. And in that respect, it's maybe not a constraint on size or scale or complexity, but it's constraints on efficiency and on the retrievability of information and on the lower limits of how efficient you can make a system. I'd love to hear you provide an exegesis of this piece. ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:Yes. Happily. I'm glad you brought it up because I think it's conceptually very closely related to the stuff we were discussing before about semantic information and meaningful information versus just sort of meaningless correlations. One of the ideas in non-equilibrium physics is that there's a classic paradox in cynical physics, which is something called Maxwell's demon, which some of our listeners are probably familiar with. It's this idea that the second law of thermodynamics says that things basically if left to themselves go to an equilibrium and to take them out of an equilibrium you have to do some work on it. Maxwell came up with this kind of toy model where he imagined a box of gas in equilibrium, and he imagined a little intelligent being, just observing the particles that are flying around in this box. And he observed that by opening and closing a little door , this being can sort the particles into hot and cold ones, which should not be an equilibrium state. And it can do this without doing any work or doing an arbitrarily small amount of work. And so, this is a classic paradox. It's this cynical physics that people argued a lot about. And actually, one of the reasons why there has been this kind of explosion of interest in the physics of information and the growth of this field, studying information and matter and energies, is because people feel like it's really kind of resolving this paradox in a very deep way. And the way it resolved it is that it basically shows that in order to make a measurement, the demon has to write down the information it measured into some kind of physical system like a little hard drive. And if it does this over and over and over, it has to then erase what it wrote before and write the new measurement. It has to do this over and over and over. And basically, there's different ways to explain it, but in this manner of explaining it every time erases what it wrote before it has to do a little bit of work. So, if you do the calculation, you can see that the total amount work that the demon performed in order to write down these observations and then erase them into it, write them down is at best that least as big as the work that I could then extract by sorting the particles in hot and cold ones and putting some kind of piston or some kind of engine between them and using it to lift the weight or do something useful.So basically, the resolution is if you kind of also think of this intelligent being this demon, as part of the physical world, also obeying the laws of physics, also obeying the second law of thermodynamics then the paradox is in some sense, completely resolved. It's a really interesting observation. And one of the things it says is if the demon is optimally efficient, basically then for each bit of information, it has about the system, like each yes or no question it can answer correctly about the system, it can extract a little bit of work and this little bit of work is actually proportional to about KT. This is kind of the conversion factor. It's KT log 2. But you can think about KT, it's just the unit thing.And then this paper that you mentioned about entropy production and work under constraints, maybe it sounds very practical. I would still say it's kind of a theoretical conceptual argument, but the argument is kind of related to these ideas about some managing information ideas, like actually how much work the demon can extract from the system, which is in some sense, the value of the information for the demon. So, if the demon is a little organism and is using this work that it extracts to maintain it's all fix itself, make more proteins or whatever, then work is really valuable. And so, the information it has about the system is really valuable. But one of the things we kind of pointed out is like, this information is valuable only if this demon let's say, can manipulate the system in a way that takes advantage of this information. And what do I mean by that? So, let's say, I mentioned the electron in the edge of the universe, which kind of messes up whether or not, and one atom collides into another atom or not, let's say, I know for sure whether this electron on the edge of the universe is present or not, or the electron the edge of the galaxy or whatever. There's no way I can use that information. So even though I know it, I can't put a little piston in place and have that electron push against it  because it's too far away, I'm a limited being.And so, there's a kind of alignment between what I know and what I can take advantage of. And a lot of this paper is, is kind of working out the implications of that and working out how to formalize that properly. And so, we kind of use over and over again, this example, which is closely related to Maxwell's demon, and it kind of comes from the literature of that is that you have a box and you have a single particle in the box flying around. And you then make a measurement. So, you acquire a bit of information: is this particle on the left or the right side of the box. And depending on whether it's on the left or the right side of the box, you put in a little vertical partition to separate the two halves. And then if you now know whether it's on the left or the right side of the partition, you can actually move the partition in this slowly and extract some work. And basically, you can turn that knowledge, that information you have into something useful, which is energy.And what we point out is that the whole set up depends on the alignment between the fact that you measure, whether the particle is on the left or the right side of the box. And then you will have a vertical partition that can split the box into the left and the right half, if you had a horizontal partition barrier that could split the box into a top and bottom, it would be completely useless to you to know whether the particles are on the left or right. You couldn't actually take advantage of that.This connects to this idea of semantic information, what is meaningful information to you depends on how you can interact with the world. And certainly, organisms are very limited in how they can interact with the world. For example, we're very local, right? We can only go to one place and eat from one place at a time. We can't use magnetic fields to a couple, two distant locations at once. And we have lots of other constraints on how we can attract them with the world. And I think at a very high level, certainly what we've evolved to measure is the kind of information that we can take advantage of. But also, one could use these results to maybe look at a system that we didn't know if it evolved or not if we didn't know anything about it. And we could say, how efficient is it in the sense, is it measuring things that it can then use or not? So that's kind of the breakdown of the paper.And again, in a way it's kind of in some high-level ways it's influenced by this idea from embodied cognitive science, right. So partly what gives meaning to things is the body you have also what constrains you sometimes in very useful ways. Like we're not just missing embodied brains and vats that are just like processing bits. MICHAEL GARFIELD:Because I'm in this body, in this place in time, which is responsible for distilling this stuff for Twitter, I'm always watching for like the pithy aphorism or like, how do I encapsulate this in a way that I can make it through the electronic membrane. And what this boils down to, it seems like for me, correct me if I'm wrong, is what you're saying is that you're providing the mathematical formulations for why time sometimes is, but it's not always money. Why knowledge sometimes is, but it's not always power.And then like how, when we had Mirta Galesic on the show and she's talking about politically motivated cognition and how people have these biases, where they project out into the world, their inferences are based on local information. And they error all of us, err by assuming that the features of our little corner or a little patch of the world is representative of the world as a whole. And therefore, you get into these weird situations. where we don't actually care about actually, what is true so much as we care about what allows us to synchronize and collaborate effectively with the people upon whom we depend or the systems upon which we depend that it seems like your work is shedding light on that.And like why it is that we favor certain kinds of knowledge over other kinds of knowledge. And yet we tend to paint it all with this single brush and call it all the truth. Or the fact when in fact, it's much more variable and heterogeneous. ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:Certainly, knowing the lottery ticket numbers for yesterday's drawing is different from knowing them for tomorrow. But similar types of information can have very different implications. I think you painted this constrained nature and sort of a drawback or a limitation. But I also think and this is not really something we address in the paper, but something I'm kind of interested in exploring is like, I actually think it is because we, as organisms are so constrained that it makes sense to acquire information. It makes sense to have intelligence and make sense to have very sophisticated, complex behaviors.And what I mean by that is if, for example, we could be in every place at once. I mean if we could couple with distant locations, we wouldn't need eyesight. And we wouldn't need visual processing and we wouldn't need all these like amazing locomotion body movement behaviors that organisms do. Maybe it's kind of a truism, but like the really amazing cognitive behavioral and sensory things that we do individually and collectively are ways to overcome our limitations.Just to give you a simple example, we go back to Maxwell's demon, which is sometimes seen as like a minimal model of a kind of information using organisms, which I think is actually a bad model for various reasons. Although it's a provocative one. But as I said, like Maxwell's demon, if it's operating completely optimally can at best break even meaning the best it can do is the same that it would do by not doing anything at all. One reason for that is because it's not constrained in any way, so there's no sort of advantage to acquiring the right kind of information or processing it in the right way and so on. MICHAEL GARFIELD:It's a fascinating thing. I feel like we've rounded the bases here. If people's heads aren't spinning now, then all I can do, I guess, invite them to look you up on Twitter.ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:Play crazy sound effects like they do on Mexican radio stations.MICHAEL GARFIELD:Read these papers and see if that does it for you. ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI: thank you so much for being on the show. It's just such an inspiring thing to talk to you every time I have the opportunity to do so. ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:Thank you, Michael. Thank you for doing the show. I mean, you're like running an amazing one-man content producing and disseminating. I think it really does an amazing job with the show and the social media stuff in general. Very impressive.MICHAEL GARFIELD:Like with everything at SFI, it is a team project. This show is supported through a lot of help. People like Jenna Marshall, our communications manager, the SFI press, Laura and Sienna and Katie and everybody working at IP Fest. You know, it's just, it's a beautiful thing to be part of. I don't know what you would call this a Markoff blanket of dorks, but you know, I really hope that wherever this research leads you, this conversation leads people to you.And it leads people into these questions because I find these questions to be some of the juiciest and most nutritious questions we can be asking about this world. And, and really it's just recursive. It's just endless. It gets you all the way there. And then you realize you're never going to get there because the horizon keeps on. Rolling. So thanks a lot, man.ARTEMY KOLCHINSKI:Yeah. It's good to think about one small part of it that encapsulates the bigger issues and I think it can be done. And I think maybe that's one way forward actually. Anyway, thanks a lot. Let's hang when the, lockdown is over, maybe?\MICHAEL GARFIELD:Sounds good.CLOSINGThank you for listening.

Thank you and enjoy: Sam Scarpino (0s):What's important for my perspective, is that getting experience working in and valuing interdisciplinary teams. And certainly a part of that is the kinds of things that happen at Santa Fe, where you just spend time immersed with a lot of diverse researchers and you understand more and more how to operate in that kind of context. But then I think also having the interest and humility to work and learn as a part of those groups is really important. So I actually really hope that we can kind of shift the messaging a bit to kind of talk about how important it is that we have these interdisciplinary collaborations, but that people come to the table with an interest to help and learn and, and be productive as opposed to, you know, just try to make statements and take attention and resources and energy away from individuals who are working and have that expertise. Michael Garfield (1m 8s):COVID-19, hasn't just disrupted the normal of everyone's social practices in what we take for granted as daily life. The pandemic has also more granularly changed the way scientists research and publish. It has changed the way science interfaces with institutions as varied as local governments and cell phone companies. It has changed the way we host produced this podcast. This episode, for instance, with SFI External Professor Sam Scarpino and Resident Professor Michael Lachmann was recorded live over a year end donor appreciation zoom call for those who both contributed to SFI in 2020 and could handle yet one more group of video chat. Michael Garfield (1m 50s):In it we discuss their lessons from the front lines of network epidemiology this year. What has surprised them? What has stayed with them and what they expect it all to mean in the years to come. Welcome to complexity the official podcast at the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield. And every other week, we bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks, to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This will be our last episode of 2020. We'll see you again in the middle of January 2021, TIS the season. So if you value our research and communication efforts, please consider making a donation@santafe.edu slash podcast, give and/or rating and reviewing us at Apple podcasts. Michael Garfield (2m 41s):Avid readers, take note that the SFI press’ latest, Complexity Economics, is now available as a free ebook with donation at sfipress.org. You can find numerous other ways to engage with us at Santa fe.edu/engage, and undergrads, you still have until January 11 to submit for our 2021 undergraduate complexity research program at santafe.edu slash UCR. Thanks for listening and happy holidays. Alanna Faust (3m 10s):Hello to everyone. For those of you that don't know me, my name is Alana. I'm the one who's been sending you many emails. And we often at the end of the year, have some sort of in-person winter tea to thank all of the people who support SFI and support this research. We cannot be in person this year. So much of what we do is now virtual. And I was really excited that Michael Garfield was willing to move the Complexity podcast and have it live and let all of us spectate and then participate. Yeah, I mean, this is a big, thank you to all of you who allow us to do our jobs and I hope you enjoy yourself. Alanna Faust (3m 59s):This is recorded. So everyone's going to be muted for the duration. After the conversation, if you have a question, there will be a section for Q and A, and you can either raise your hand or put your question in the chat. If you do have a question in the initial part during the conversation piece, you're welcome to put that in the zoom chat and Michael may see it and include it in the conversation. Otherwise you can wait for the later portion. There's also closed captioning available at the bottom of your screen, and you should just be able to toggle that on and off. Alanna Faust (4m 39s):So I'm going to introduce the people who are spot lit right now. First off we have Michael Lachmann. Michael Lachmann is a theoretical biologist whose primary interest lie in understanding evolutionary processes and their origin. His work focuses on the interface between evolution and information. Lachmann received his Bachelor's of Science at the Tel Aviv University, and then his PhD in Biology at Stanford. Both of our guests today were actually post-docs at SFI. Then Lachmann went on to work at the Max Planck Institute and is now a Resident Professor at SFI. Alanna Faust (5m 22s):Our second guest Sam Scarpino is an Assistant Professor in Network Science at Northeastern University, as well as an External Professor at SFI. Scarpino’s research spans a broad range of topics and complex systems and network science, including forecasting and predictive modeling, complex network analysis, epidemiology, genomics and transcript genomics, social networks, and decision making under uncertainty. Scarpino’s research on COVID-19, Ebola, whooping cough, and influenza has been covered by the New York Times, the Washington Post, NPR, Vice, Bloomberg, Stat News and many others. Scarpino earned a PhD in Ecology, Evolution and behavior from the University of Texas at Austin, and as I mentioned, was an Omidyar Fellow, a post-doc at SFI. Alanna Faust (6m 9s):And lastly, we have Michael Garfield, the wonderful host of the Complexity podcast. Michael Garfield studied Ecology and Evolutionary Biology as an undergrad at the University of Kansas, and spent seven summers doing paleo-ecological field work for the Wyoming Dinosaur Society. And after 13 years as a scientific illustrator and transmedia artist, he joined SFI in 2018 to translate Complexity Science for social media and post this very podcast. So I'm really thankful that you're all here, and I can't wait to listen to you talk about what has been a rather eventful year. Thank you. Michael Garfield (6m 57s):Excellent. Yeah. So I think the right place to start with both of you gentlemen would be to just talk a little bit about, I mean, it's already the case that every researcher at SFI has very diverse interests and is their hands in a lot of different research questions, but it's nonetheless the case that for both of you, as well as for many others in this community, this year has precipitated a rather significant pivot in your research activities, and in your relationships to other scientists and to other institutions. And I know in your case, in particular, Michael, you've kind of farmed yourself out to the University of Texas COVID modeling consortium this year with external professor Lauren Ansell Myers. Michael Garfield (7m 45s):I'd love to hear from you first and then from Sam, how this pandemic has changed the way that you practice as a scientist and how it's changed the kind of research collaborations and the kind of consulting work and advisory work that you've been involved in. That seems like a good place to start. Michael Lachmann (8m 10s):Yeah, I mean, my work since say end of March changed totally. So I, I offered myself to Lauren to do anything she wants in her consortium. And since then I've been there as a programmer and modeler and I do it all the time. So I totally dropped all my other projects and work on it from like 20, 20 hours a day. And slowly, I mean, at the beginning, I have a mathematical background that covers modeling of epidemiology, but I've never done it slowly as I worked on it. I became proficient and trusted myself to do more things. But yeah, the work now is very different from what I did at any time before. Michael Garfield (8m 54s):How about you, Sam? Sam Scarpino (8m 56s):I think from my perspective, it's been similar in some ways to past experiences with Ebola and with H1N1, although for a much longer period of time and a much more organizational way, especially in terms of how it's affected my life outside of practicing research. So I just finished teaching 150 person intro stats course remotely, which is not something I necessarily expect that I'd ever be doing at least at least synchronously. I think for me, the two biggest changes have been one, how much I interface with journalists and in what capacity. So in the past, I've definitely talked with journalism regularly about my science and work that our group is doing. Sam Scarpino (9m 35s):And since the pandemic started, that's happened a couple of times, but primarily it's talking with journalists who are just interested in understanding more about a particular aspect of COVID not necessarily something that I'm directly working on. And so just the types of conversations and the volume of conversations is completely different than something I've never experienced before. And similarly, I spent a great deal of time working with city governments, mayors, city councils, their emergency response teams, doing similar work, trying to help them understand as much as I do or at least tell them the things that I don't understand about COVID 19. On the research side, and it's actually kind of interesting, I'd be curious to hear Michael's thoughts on this. Sam Scarpino (10m 17s):And so most of my research group does not work on infectious diseases and they've all contributed to COVID in a variety of different ways, but I have been pushing them to turn back to their own research projects because they have dissertations to complete and research projects that they're continuing to work on. So trying to strike that balance between their desire and interest to contribute, but also wanting to make sure that they finish on time and that the research project they're excited about and that they've poured their energy into continue to progress. That's been something I've been trying to balance as well. Michael Garfield (10m 51s):Yes. So listening to you speak about the stuff I am called back to David Kenny's contribution to our Transmission essay series back in what seems like the Dawn Age of March, 2020 when he made it really interesting point in that piece about how scientists prefer to carefully disclaim their research findings, to talk about uncertainty, to talk about margin of error, but when it comes to advisement on public policy, our political actors are public leaders. Heads of institutions wants clear, actionable advice. And in our email lead up to this conversation, both of you addressed challenges in this particular case with different kinds of the poverty of data and radical uncertainty that we've been dealing with in this situation. Michael Garfield (11m 45s):So Sam, when we had you on the show back in episode 25, you spoke to some writing that you did on how this is linked specifically to economic inequality and the poverty of data coming from disenfranchised populations. How that affects the way that we respond to this. Michael, you've spoken about your interest in rapid testing, which is an area where we're called to take less accurate, less precise results. Michael Mina gave a great talk on this. That's up on our YouTube channel about how sampling at a higher rate with fuzzier results can give us better information and a better opportunity to respond. Michael Garfield (12m 27s):So I'm curious just where both of you are on this issue of uncertainty and actually how to turn into that particular problem, and how to possibly to use uncertainty in our favor in this situation, or where it's still a crippling issue for response in this particular case and in the address of other complex issues, predicaments. Michael Lachmann (12m 53s):Yeah. In our work where we try to model Austin or Texas, there's big problems. So the problem here is that we don't really choose our data. We just get data, and very often we can’t control the quality of the data. So when we get data about hospitals, it's hard for the hospitals to provide it. They need to enter all the patients every day exactly. And then, and then it can happen that say one hospital, didn’t do it one day. And if we don't know about it, or even if we do know about it, it makes modeling much, much harder. So the additional noise that is in the data that we can't control because everything is crazy makes modeling, and because of this also predictions, much harder to do. Sam Scarpino (13m 40s):Yeah. I mean on the data side, this is one of the things that we got involved in right away, back in January, it it's kind of become the standard operating procedure for infectious disease outbreaks that academics will start essentially hand coding data as it gets reported across myriad sources. So you can remember back to January, we were reading news reports about cases that were happening outside of China, cases in China, and that most of the information around the pandemic was actually things that were reported via journalists because the regular reporting systems from the countries, the WHL, et cetera, hadn't been set up yet. So I was a part of this volunteer consortium, about a hundred people from all over the world that were manually entering in data. Sam Scarpino (14m 22s):As it was reported in the newspapers, we entered tens of thousands of individual-level anonymized COVID cases by hand moving into February. And then we spent the last six months working with a team of software engineers who were on loan from Google to build a cloud data platform that automated the process of pulling in all of these disparate data sources, aligning them, cleaning them, ensuring that they're interoperable doing two, a D duplication process. And so we've now got about 7 million individual-level COVID cases, 160 countries. And this is what the New York Times Magazine Stephen Johnson covered when he said that this is perhaps the most complete portrait of this pandemic it's collected anywhere. Sam Scarpino (15m 3s):And these data have been used the power all kinds of scientific studies all over the world. If you look at the rt.live, the chats, the real-time affective reproductive number, they use the data that we captured from China on the delay distribution between symptom onset and PCR confirmation on how that shifts in time to calibrate their model estimates that everybody are looking at. So we kind of attack the data problem from trying to go to the source and work on that. And now we've got, we are actually very fortunate to receive funding support from a couple of large foundations, it hasn't been announced yet, to continue this work going forward, both for COVID, but then also for future pandemics to ensure that we have the data systems in place that people like Michael and Lauren's team in Texas rely on for their predictive modeling. Michael Garfield (15m 49s):So like a related question, you brought up, you kind of alluded to a moment ago, and both of you addressed this in the lead up email thread, which is the way that this situation and other crises create all hands on deck opportunities that tend to pull people into collaborations. That would seem at least on the first pass outside of their area of expertise. I mean, this is perhaps just a microcosm of the way that a rapidly changing world requires a rapid response and challenges are established metrics for expertise in the first place, but it calls up all of this question. Michael Garfield (16m 32s):Like Caroline Buck, you talked about this when she was on the show, about people that are swerving out of their lane, and offering advice on issues about which they know nothing, and they're blocking the communications channels and increasing the noise in the discourse around this, making it hard for people who really ought to be given the microphone and opportunity to speak. This is an especially difficult problem for female scientists and scientists of color. It's aggravating existing social inequities, but at the same time, it kind of speaks to this kind of broader issue with Complex Systems science and interdisciplinary research in the first place. Michael Garfield (17m 14s):And I'd love to hear you talk to both the issue of Sam, what you called epistemic trespass. I love that phrase and where it is and is not an appropriate accusation of what's going on here. And you know, where it is that people without formal training in epidemiology or a related area really are needed in this. Because I think the way that research collaborations are taking place now and the way that this has accelerated the sharing of on peer reviewed preprints and so on is a window into the way that science is going to be practiced more commonly in the years to come. Michael Garfield (17m 56s):And so these problems seem really worth attending to now. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Whoever cares to speak first. Sam Scarpino (18m 3s):Well, I'll be brief cause I'm definitely curious to hear more about Michael's experience with Lauren and her team, but, you know, I am, I'm very torn about this because I think we've seen a lot of high-profile examples of deeply unproductive statements coming from individuals that don't have the expertise and experience to be making them that are sucking up the communication channels and the attention as you said, but I also don't have any formal training in epidemiology. And I think one of the interesting things that happened is that a colleague of mine, Professor Brandon Bruno who's at Yale, wrote this article for Wired magazine called “COVID-19 Carpetbaggers” and how to identify them. And he listed me as an epidemiologist. Sam Scarpino (18m 44s):And then I tweeted and said that I'm not an epidemiologist. And then Twitter was arguing about whether or not I was an epidemiologist. Nobody could agree. And so I think one of the things that the real challenge is like on the call right now, the three of us should be talking about how spiral shaped molecules cells evolve or something, right? Like not about COVID like our background is in seemingly unrelated fields. Although of course, as Michael mentioned, the math that that describes how populations change can be applied to lots of different systems. And so I think what's important for my perspective is that getting experienced working in and valuing interdisciplinary teams and certainly a part of that is the kinds of things that happen at Santa Fe, where you just spend time immersed with a lot of diverse researchers and you understand more and more how to operate in that kind of context. Sam Scarpino (19m 26s):But then I think also having the interest and humility to work and learn as a part of those groups is really important. So I actually really hope that we can kind of shift the messaging a bit to kind of talk about how important it is that we have these interdisciplinary collaborations, but that people come to the table with an interest to help and learn and, and be productive as opposed to, you know, just try to make statements and take attention and resources and energy away from individuals who are working and have that expertise. Michael Garfield (19m 55s):And that's a constant issue in our Facebook group, reminding people to operate with negative capability, come in, eager to learn. Yeah. Michael, what about you? Michael Lachmann (20m 5s):Yeah, Lauren's group, so there's like the UT Consortium. It is really amazing how many, how diverse the people who work there are and also how many people offer their expertise. So there are mathematicians, physicists, engineers, all just want to help [inaudible] asks all the time, ask whatever, you know, like, is there any coding that they can help us with? So that group is really amazing. And how diversity is people who just want to come and help. The same is actually also true for the rapid testing group, like rapid tests.org. We're also there's people who just want to help. Michael Lachmann (20m 47s):And they say, you know, like some know video editing, other know how to talk to people, things like that. So I think that that is really amazing in this pandemic. In terms of expertise, it’s a very complex issue because I think that everybody who works on COVID is way over the work. I mean, it is a, like I said, you work all the time and any help would be good, especially the COVID epidemic is I think very complex. And these days it's not the virus anymore that we need to model. Actually it has been from the beginning, but now even more, it's not the virus that we need to model. It's the people. it's hard to understand what the people will be doing. Michael Lachmann (21m 29s):And I don't think that we don't really necessarily have the right expertise to do it. So I think that any help should be accepted with open arms, but of course, on the other side, it's not easy to talk in a way that will help. It took me several months until I understood the language enough so that I could contribute. And I know friends of mine who wanted to help model wrote a very nice model, but the problem is it's really hard to get it into the community. The community knows to language that they're talking in and the model that comes from some other fields is not understandable. So I think it's a problem. Like on one hand, you really need a lot of help, but on the other hand, it's really hard to give you that help. Michael Garfield (22m 13s):So I'd like to peg from this into a question that ties into research that you've both done on human social relationships, because I think one of the things that we've continued to bang the pan about at SFI --  David Krakauer brought this up very early in our Transmission series -- was how this particular epidemic and epidemics in general, in so far as complexity researchers like to think in terms of flows of information, then the flow of the information contained in a viral genome is kind of fungible in some ways with other kinds of information that flow through human social networks. Michael Garfield (22m 59s):And, Sam, you had a paper that you did with Laurent Hebert-Dufresne and Jean-Gabriel Young on macroscopic patterns of interacting contagions, how they're indistinguishable from social reinforcement. Michael you've done work on costly signaling and the body's inhibition of cancer signals to try and cheat their way into more nutrition from the body. So, you know, I think about all of this and how it's related to how the lowered barrier to access in discourse through the erosion of legitimacy and traditional institutions, and new sources, has allowed more bad actors into the conversation has escalated, informational warfare, the proliferation of QAnon this year to be piggy-backing on the epidemic. Michael Garfield (23m 49s):And I'm just curious how you two feel that your research in this area does or does not eliminate this issue. And you know, what it might mean for how we think about systems of human communication in the future to not only inhibit the spread of future epidemics, but also future epidemics of socially deleterious human behavior and human belief. If we can go there. Sam Scarpino (24m 19s):You want to go first, Michael, or Michael Lachmann (24m 21s):I can try. I mean, I think that there is a question, what is driving changes in the epidemic? So for example, in the early modeling of, in Austin, you can see right there, was an early time when the epidemic was really growing exponentially and then it stopped. And it was around the time when a lot of mitigation strategies were enacted, like lockdown, and schools closed and so on. But I think what we see in our data is that the numbers started to go down in Austin before lockdown. It started to go down when schools closed and college closed. Michael Lachmann (25m 2s):Even though today, we think that directly schools don't really cause so much outbreak. But I think what happened was that the closing of schools was a signal to people that this is really serious. So they started to respond already. And we also see it later, where if the governor of Texas announced that people should wear masks. And I think that was again a very strong signal in itself, even if people didn't start wearing masks immediately, but they treated the disease more carefully, more seriously. So I think that a lot of the measures aren't just measures in what they do. They're also a signal to people what is happening with the disease. Sam Scarpino (25m 41s):Yeah. I think that it's a really interesting and challenging question from a whole bunch of different directions. So the paper that you mentioned, Michael, we were showing that a classic model that a lot of social scientists use to study information sharing on networks, the social reinforcement, where it's kind of like a voter model for how information transmits. So you're going to continue to hold the belief you have, unless both Michael and I are saying otherwise, and then you'll switch your belief as opposed to just getting infected from me only. So there's kind of this threshold. And what we show is that those are analytically equivalent to models that biologists use to study interacting pathogens, moving through this, the same population of posts. Sam Scarpino (26m 21s):And why am I telling this story? Well, I think the interesting part of this to me is that the co-authors of the paper and I actually disagree about what the most important take home message is. So they think the most important take home message is that we can take a single time series and use our social reinforcement model to ask whether there's any evidence for interacting pathogens or any other kind of weird non-linearity that's present when normally it would take at least two times series or, or more data to do that. And so basically this like silver lining, what I see is, well, we actually don't have a way of inferring the mechanism that's causing something to spread from the time series data alone, that you have to bring in external information and think about how you actually evaluate mechanism from a lot of different angles. Sam Scarpino (27m 6s):And I both find that to be perhaps pessimistic, but also very exciting from a scientific perspective that it means we have to bring to bear lots of different models and data and inference methods and expertise to try to understand what's going on. And to Michael's point raises a really interesting question, really, we saw the same thing in Boston. It was one of the reasons why I and others were so critical of the IHMI forecasting models is that they said, okay, if you have a shelter in place mandate, here's what happens to transmission. And that's not what happened. People lock themselves down weeks before any of that went into place because they were scared. And so the real thing that we have to understand is what is influencing people's behavior. How does that interact with their social networks and the pathogens to end up affecting or not a disease transmission? Sam Scarpino (27m 49s):And so even from the very, very earliest days of COVID, which should have been about as simple the model as it's ever going to get like a fully susceptible population, almost literally one person walks off of an airplane into the population that immediately becomes vastly more complex. As soon as people start to respond to that pathogen in terms of how they are going about their day-to-day lives. And I think that's all the more reason why we need the kinds of interdisciplinary collaborations that we started this conversation with. Michael Garfield (28m 17s):So to that point, you know, looking at network structure, whether it's in collaboration networks or whether it's in the structure of our cities and how they're organized, I mean, it's clear that what counts as an effective intervention in one Metro area doesn't seem to work across the board, that we have to think about this in terms of how different cities have grown up over time. And I know Sam, you just coauthored a paper in Nature about this, about the metapopulation structure of our cities. I'd love to hear you give us a short exegesis of that work. And maybe if we have insights, the two of you can draw from that into thinking about how, you know, just for example, like the, I remember Richard Florida published a really interesting piece a couple months ago on his blog about how the structure of our cities has already reacted to previous epidemics that, you know, the porcelain bathroom, wasn't a thing until we realized that germs were lingering and wooden toilets and that kind of thing. Michael Garfield (29m 26s):And so we've the way that we have come up with the design of our urban spaces has changed a lot. And, you know, other than the apparent and horrifying emergent norm of, you know, constant face masks and the new radius of personal space that we might just be sort of left with after this, I'm curious about these insights and how you imagine they might change the way that we react to one another going forward in the 21st century. Sam Scarpino (29m 53s):Yeah, well, I'm really fascinated about that in general. I think one of the things that very few of us have appreciated is how much trauma we've gone through. Even if you haven't had COVID or don't know anyone directly who's had it, or worse that it's affected our lives so dramatically that we're going to be processing this for the rest of our lives. And in the same way that, you know, I remember my grandfather telling my dad before he left to go to college, how you could try to talk food out of a restaurant if you're hungry. And it's clearly, you know, his memory of growing up in the depression and going hungry and that this has this organizational effect on the rest of your life. And I think we're all going to be doing that in ways that we haven't really come to understand yet. Sam Scarpino (30m 34s):And I suspect a lot of that will affect our cities and how they're organized. And so one of the things we tried to do in this paper is answer, or at least start to try and peel back some of what Michael was mentioning around why this epidemic persists in some places and seems to burn out quickly and other places. And it turns out that there's quite a bit of literature on this, both in the theoretical and empirical sides of epidemiology. So papers from Duncan Watson, Peter Dodds, looking at the effect of hierarchical community structure on an academic process. And so what you kind of imagine is you've got households that are in neighborhoods that are in larger areas of cities, and then cities have these kinds of conglomerates of these neighborhoods, and that depending on the biology of the pathogen, you may have like these little mini outbreaks that are happening in households, and then it takes a little bit longer to jump into another household in a different neighborhood. And so if you actually had the really high resolution data, you'd see all these little waves that are kind of on top of each other, but because our data are noisy and the system itself is kind of noisy, it's this long kind of smear of cases that just drags on and on and on and on and on. And so we took data from China and Italy that had already completed their first waves of the outbreak and showed that the width and height of the epidemic curves in hundreds and hundreds of cities across Italy and China is well predicted based on a simple measure of population aggregation in space. Sam Scarpino (31m 60s):And that this is something that's predicted from theoretical models and actually was shown in one of my favorite papers on epidemiology by professor Lisa Sattenspiel, an anthropological study of fur traders in Canada during the 1918 flu pandemic, where she actually showed that you get this kind of divide between tightly connected groups of fur traders and fur trading outpost versus more loosely connected, and it drives these kinds of multi-wave epidemics and junior coauthors coupled those data like the log book data from the fur traders with the 1918 flu cases with these agent-based studies. So I think that these are the kinds of things that so many of us on the call understand how to work with and model. And that's again, partly why bringing this kind of interdisciplinary collaboration is so important because we do need to learn something about all the ways in which we understand how cities operate and they're organized and how that affects dynamical processes. Sam Scarpino (32m 51s):But then as we move forward and we have to think about what do cities 2.0 look like? How do we best keep the things that we think are important about social networks and cities and, you know, the kinds of work that's been done pioneered at Santa Fe Institute, while doing the best that we can to mitigate the future epidemic risks. So I think it's going to be a really critical area of complex systems research and science for years, as a result of our realization about the fragility of so much of our organization, especially in United States and in Western Europe with respect to the effects of COVID. Michael Garfield (33m 25s):Michael, this seems related to a topic you brought up ahead of this conversation about the strange behavior of the pandemic, how it, the curve is staying flat much longer than the models would predict. I don't know if you want to link to that or if, but that seems like an interesting association. Michael Lachmann (33m 41s):Yeah. I mean, I think that at the middle stage of the pandemic as we saw it in Austin, but I think in many, many other places, that the pandemic has had this long stasis where the cases stayed high, but overall almost constant. And I think in most models that is really hard to get something like this, because most models you will either have, I mean, regular models will have exponential growth or exponential decline, but even if you modify the model to have a network structure, it's still hard to get stasis. You will either have maybe linear growth or gross, like cubic growth or something like this, like to get real stasis I think it's very hard to get to the model. Michael Lachmann (34m 24s):And then, so my interpretation was that it has, therefore it has to be, it has to be some kind of feedback. So there has to be feedback that comes from the community where the community sees something about the epidemic and then response. It could even be something as simple as people moving out of from New York, because they don't like it there anymore, that it are so dangerous or people moving to Santa Fe because it looks so risk-free. But I think that Sam could talk about this issue much better than me. Michael Garfield (34m 57s):Do you care to, or shall we launch into the Q & A? Sam Scarpino (35m 1s):Well, I'll just mention just very briefly that, and I actually think this is something that would be really interesting to work on is we're tracking a lot of mobility data. And one of the things that was true back in the lockdowns in the spring is that every way we slice and dice the mobility data, it was crashing. But now we see that it's coming back up differentially. So for example, over Thanksgiving, we saw nationally that we had near pre-COVID levels of durations of social contacts outside of the household. However, we were still down 50% in terms of the number of unique social contacts. We've seen that mobility outside the household for shopping has come back up to, you know, maybe 60, 70% of normal, but commute flows are still way down, but have been creeping up slowly, slowly, slowly over the past few months. Sam Scarpino (35m 48s):And in my head, I can't get this image of the suburbs around Boston, that until the commute flow came back online were previously basically isolated from each other. And then you have individuals going back to work in Boston mixing, and then going back out to the suburbs again. And so I think what we really are seeing is this like really rapid heterogeneity that has evolved in terms of our social contacts and our social networks. And it means that, you know, even trying to answer what seems like a fairly simple question from Michael about why is the epidemic curve so long becomes deeply, deeply complicated. Very quickly. Michael Garfield (36m 22s):That question of heterogeneity. We have a question from the audience, Kirsten Canes, I believe. Kevin, if we can get you to unmute Kirsten so she can ask her question to our panelists here. Kirsten Canes (36m 34s):Hi, thanks for giving me the opportunity to ask a question. And I appreciate the speakers. This was very informative. I'm interested in racial disproportionalities, and in particular, the evidence that the disease burden is different for different racial groups, but so is the effect of remote learning and the potential risk to miss learning opportunities for people of color. And so I'm wondering how often policy makers and your scientific community asks you to think about those issues. And also what you think are the most promising areas of research to help us make decisions, to mitigate risks for people of color in the United States. Michael Garfield (37m 17s):Thank you. Michael Lachmann (37m 18s):I can address it a bit. So in our consortium, it's a constant issue that we work with all the time. So our, our modeling of Austin for example, is one big mishmash where all of Austin, other than age groups and risk groups, is considered as one big pot. But when we look at data, we see that it is very much not like that. And we have been since the beginning of the epidemic have been trying to take that into account in everything we do. It is not easy because anytime you try to make the model more precise, it's easy to make the model more precise, but it's very hard to then fit the parameters so that you can use this. Michael Lachmann (38m 1s):So we need to have parameters, like how much do people move from one area of the city to another, or how much, how many people work as essential workers and so on. So it's easy to care, but it's hard to actually do something. Sam Scarpino (38m 16s):I think just very briefly. I mean, one of the things that we're going to have to figure out in this country going forward is how to prevent this from happening again, if there's another pandemic right. So one of the big challenges that local school boards, mayors, et cetera, we're faced with is that they can't close the restaurants without a federal bailout. Even the States really can't do that. They don't have enough money to bail out the restaurants. They can close the schools and that's doing something. And so I think we saw lots of cases across the U.S. where the schools were closed, because that was the thing that they could do without the federal government support. Similarly, in terms of the CDC, until very recently, they'd been providing almost no guidance whatsoever with respect to what people should be doing. Sam Scarpino (38m 60s):And so you have mayors, city councils, school boards that are faced with this decision of trying to decide whether schools are safe or not. And they don't have the data, they don't have the guidance, and they don't have the leadership that they need. And instead, then they fall back on influenza where it is high risk for children, and schools are key drivers. And so they fall back on what they do know, and they close the schools. And we're only now very slowly starting to see that the CDC is providing the kinds of data that as Michael mentioned, shows that schools are well not, no risk, are low risk for transmission, and they can help with the reopening. And of course I'm sure you understand better than I do, and many people on the call do, that schools provide a lot more than just what happens in the classroom with the teacher across the community. Sam Scarpino (39m 45s):And so that when the schools are closed, there's a huge cost that the children pay in terms of their development, but behavior, but also in terms of the community and the support that they have. With respect to communities of color, one of the key issues is that quite often the same kinds of effects of racism and xenophobia that caused these higher health burdens also result in a lack of information that's available to public health agencies, to Michael Lachmann and Lauren Ancel Meyers, to actually model what's going on and what the needs are. So one of the ways that governments disempower individuals is by not collecting data on them. Sam Scarpino (40m 26s):It's why we were fighting over the census so often. We actually published a paper about this over the summer, showing that individuals who were in the highest risk groups for influenza by socioeconomic status are less likely to be in the surveillance data sites, which means we have more bias in our forecast, less understanding of the demand. And then of course, we move into the vaccine era. You know, we're seeing in Massachusetts that individuals who are non-healthcare essential workers aren't being prioritized for the vaccine. So the same kinds of lack of equity. We also aren't engaging with the fact that many of these communities have earned a deep distrust of the government, especially as it pertains to vaccines and medical care. And we're not really addressing that from a communications perspective, trying to build back that trust. Sam Scarpino (41m 6s):And so I think it's a very complicated issue that is going to require a lot of attention to work if we want to be able to move forward at all from where we are right now. Michael Garfield (41m 17s):Thanks. So I'd like to open this up, Kevin, if you can unmute Alan Covich. I hope I'm saying that, right. Alan had a question. Oh, I was just curious about individual based modeling. It seems like that's a pretty widely used kind of thing. And the areas of movement ecology. It seems like it'd be really helpful to short out different risks in terms of how people interact when they're out doing various types of things, be it hiking, bicycling, shopping, whatever. There may not be enough data to really make that helpful. It seems as though it would be a tool that everybody’s been using for lots of different kinds of reasons, and certainly generate the interdisciplinary curiosity that could also develop some new ideas. Sam Scarpino:I guess, very briefly, and my [inaudible] has a lot more experience given the kinds of modeling they're doing in Lauren's group, although I think most of it's not agent-based modeling, but yeah, one of the things that's different about COVID is that the technology companies have opened up their data to researchers and public health in a way that they have never before. Sam Scarpino (42m 20s):So we have this incredible lens into what individual people are doing as they go about their day-to-day lives. It's actually, I think one of the big issues we're going to have to address as we go forward. So in South Korea, for example, they have this social contract between the citizens and the South Korean CDC, as a result of SARS and MERS that says if these kinds of public health triggers happen, then the mobility data from the telecommunications companies gets handed over to the Korean CDC as a part of the response. So that the public is actually benefiting from the invasion of privacy happening from the telecommunications companies. In the U.S. that's not the case, right? Like, so we have our privacy massively invaded by the tech companies, but then we don't get the data to benefit from it. Sam Scarpino (43m 0s):And this is one of the first times when we have actually gotten access to these kinds of data and literally can look and see how people's movements are changing on a zip code by zip code level data by day by day, as they respond to different orders and fear and all of the other things that we've seen. So this is really the first time you had the data to be able to approach, at least the detailed level forecasts with those kinds of models.  Alan Covich:There was some discussion about having cell phones, being able to interact and actually be able to map locations of individuals that would certainly be some rich data for individual base modeling. Sam Scarpino:Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, absolutely. We were supposed to have all these contact tracing exposure alerts with the Apple, Google collaboration and the Bluetooth and everything else. Sam Scarpino (43m 47s):And somebody asked me the other day, what I thought about the ethics of that. And I said, I wish we were talking about the ethics of that because somebody had actually done it instead of, we don't have the damn thing, especially in the U.S., it's just been inaction after inaction after inaction. And so I think we should have had a conversation about whether we would have benefited from that as a society. And if we came down on the side of, yes, we should have done it, but Mike, I don't know what your thoughts are on agent-based modeling. I know that that's an issue in Martin's lab. Michael Lachmann (44m 11s):In our group, we do every type of modeling. So the main model we use i is like I said, compartmental, so everybody is just in a group, encountered as a group. But for example, when we model schools, we have individual based models at the various levels. You know, like we have models that look at [inaudible], the students, when they are in the school bus and in the class and walking around, or we have models that just are still individual-based, but then in large batches. And like I said, the group also collaborates with many outside groups. So we have groups of engineers that did really elaborate individual-based models, where they actually do look at individuals on their way to the grocery store and back, and whether they're in the car or a bicycle, but like you said, the problem really is, I mean, there's actually two problems. Michael Lachmann (45m 1s):One is in order for that to really help you, you really need to have a well calibrated model. If the model doesn't have the right parameters, it won't give you the right answers. And the other is how fast can it run. So when we do the Texas modeling, the Austin modeling, we need to run the model thousands of times to be able to say, which of the models fits the current, what we currently have observed best, and whereas detailed individual based model it's not possible, or at least in the limited time that we had to write these, we can't make it fast enough. So that is for us, that's the main reason we don't use more elaborate network models and individual based models. Michael Garfield (45m 43s):So I'd like to open this up… Alan Covich (45m 44s):[inaudible]…a list of things to do, to get ready for the next pandemic though. You know, we were clearly behind, even though people like Bill Gates and others were making these predictions, and I think now everybody's very sensitive to the fact that this won't be the last one. The question is when will be the next one, and how much will we learn. Is there a central place where we're trying to come up with a good list of what we needed to be doing more comprehensively? Or is it still kind of scattered? Sam Scarpino:I can be very brief or try to, I mean, this is a great question and we could have a whole, well, we did have some actual SFI meetings on this a while ago and I think it'd be interesting to have one again. I think actually for me, the thing that I'm more worried about is the next 12 months, and many of the things we're going to need to do over the next 12 months are the kinds of things that we're going to want in place for the next pandemic. So for example, we don't know whether the vaccines that are coming block transmission. We don't necessarily have any reason to think that they don't, but that's not how the trials were designed. One of the projects that I started as a postdoc at SFI was to try to answer this question about whether the currently used pertussis vaccines block transmission. We are still working on that question and we are still arguing in different academic camps about what the answer is. That is a very hard question to answer, and we are not designing the right kinds of data collection systems to be able to address that as the vaccines start to roll out. Sam Scarpino (47m 8s):As COVID becomes increasingly rare, all of these things that we're talking about are going to get harder and harder and harder and harder. So one of the issues right now in Boston, is that they have to triage out people with respiratory illness that is not COVID. And as COVID becomes less common, the proportion of individuals that show up in the ER in respiratory distress due to something else is going to go up. And so, unless we have high resolution surveillance systems, unless we data sharing, unless we have a plan for how we're going to respond quickly to flare ups, what kind of measures we're going to put in place? It's going to be a mess over the next 12 months. Even if the vaccine blocks transmission at 95%, we still have to vaccinate 60 to 70% of the population in order to get to herd immunity. That's about the percent of the population right now that says they'll get the vaccine. Sam Scarpino (47m 49s):And so that's going to take a lot of work, and it's going to take at least 12 months to do it. However, we can be back to a new normal in May, if we layer in non-pharmaceutical interventions, mask wearing, physical distancing, with the vaccines as they come online in a smart way, but we're not planning for that right now. And so instead, we seem to be having this idea of, of some kind of vaccination scrum without knowing whether the transmission is going to be blocked. And even if it was, it's going to take 12 months to get back to a new normal, and we're continuing not to engage in that social contract with the public where we explained to them, here's what we're doing. Here’s when it's going to end. Here's why it's going to work. And here's why we're asking you to make these sacrifices. So hopefully with the administration change, that happens, but we are still going to be months behind by the time that occurs. Michael Lachmann (48m 32s):Yeah. I'm worrying about the next two months. I mean the growth that we see now is just incredible and the virus will not stop itself. I mean, we need to do to stop it. It might, if we don't stop it, then the vaccine might become irrelevant. We have to think about it like this, but I think that at all levels, we need to learn about how this pandemic progressed. And I think, I mean, this is out of my pay grade, out of my area, but I think what is to me totally obvious is that everything we deal with now in the next pandemic, we should never have these problems. We should never get to this stage. Michael Lachmann (49m 13s):The pandemic, every pandemic should be stopped right at the beginning before it even starts. We should never hear about them. I think there might've been 20 other pandemics that we never heard about because they were stopped at the right at the right time. This for me would be the main thing. We should have stopped it in March or January. But in terms of understanding what we did wrong, I hope we'll have enough time between this pandemic and the next to evaluate that. Michael Garfield (49m 42s):Excellent. So I'd like to open the floor to Christian Lemp. We can ask him to unmute and drop his question in here. Christian Lemp:Thank you so much. I appreciate it. One thing I was curious about is in this COVID pandemic one massively different dynamic is that we're all connected in a virtual way, much as we are now. And I'm wondering if you know anything about the behaviors that were adopted in previous pandemics, probably at the local community level. And is there anything different now that we're so super connected and we have all these new technologies? Are there any sort of negative outcomes as a result of that? Sam Scarpino:Well, I think it's super interesting if for no other reason that I've watched friends of mine become literally celebrities on the internet as a result of their work for COVID-19. It's been pretty amazing to see that happen, especially on the science side of things, and how much effort has gone into trying to combat fake news and fake information by so many scientists that are dedicating a huge amount of time to that on social media and in the news. Sam Scarpino (50m 45s):I'll answer this with, to me, what I think is one of the more interesting things I've learned about pandemics from COVID and you guys, I guess you'd think I'd already know this, but it turns out that we don't know as much as we maybe should about what happened in 1918 and how society's changed. I think it's a really interesting question about what happened, why whatever happen didn't seem to last. And actually one of the things that I was reviewing Nicholas Christakis’ book on COVID, is a sentence that says that pandemics are under appreciated in modern literature. That there's not very many pieces of modern literature that covered pandemics. I thought that there's no way that that's true. That can't be true. I mean, he said it in such a way that it was kind of a statement that you, you know, it was unfalsifiable anyways, but I said, no, I can't be true. Sam Scarpino (51m 28s):So I started doing some research and it turns out that at least one prominent modern kind of Western cannon author agrees, and that's Virginia Woolf, who wrote an essay about having the 1918 flu. And in that essay, she talks about how literature does not cover infectious diseases the way or, pandemics or anything, the way that you would have thought they were. And she provides some explanation for why she thinks that is. But I think it's a really interesting question for whether that's the case and why, and actually turns out is that we have a last kind of sidebar here is that there are apparently a minority of Wolf scholars that think that the start of Mrs. Dalloway is actually about the end of the 1918 flu pandemic instead of exiting from the Wars to like reveling in the mundane and shopping and those sorts of things. Sam Scarpino (52m 11s):And so I think there is probably a lot we can learn. I think there's probably a lot that we've recapitulated that has happened before and has been undone. But I actually think that's a really important question that probably a lot of people on this call would be able to contribute to. Michael Garfield (52m 24s):Michael, do you have thoughts on it? Michael Lachmann (52m 26s):Not as deep. What I see is mainly from the scientific side, because that is the main thing that I'm exposed to, you know, I'm working in Austin and the same group, there's people who work from LA, from Iowa, and all this wouldn't have been possible. So the collaborations that are possible, it wouldn't have been crossed, but on the other hand maybe if I wasn't working on this, I would work on the origin of life. So I definitely lost that. I say, so I think that the fact that we can in this time interact with our family, even while they are under lockdown, is an amazing contribution of the technology to what we are able to do today. Michael Lachmann (53m 9s):But I can't even talk about how much we lost. Michael Garfield (53m 14s):So gentlemen, do we have time for one more question here? I guess, as the sort of Wil Wheaton, Wesley Crusher of SFI, this one I've prepared specifically for this call, that if we have time for, I'd like to get to, which is, and we've touched on this already in the call earlier this week in the SFI musicology working group, I saw SFI Fellow Tyler Margaritas speak on his research into creative breakthroughs, you know, findings that right before a phase transition, like the Eureka moment of an individual scientist or the sudden coordinated changes that happen in a jazz ensemble that the networks, whether an individual or collective show a spike in auto correlation. I guess kind of like the hexagonal cells that form at the bottom of a pot of boiling water, suddenly a new structure emerges, and other SFI scholars, like Miguel Fuentes, Raissa de Souza, Martin Schaeffer, have all discussed about how changes in network structure precede, or possibly even help predict things like the frailty of aging brains, the imminent collapse of civilizations. Michael Garfield (54m 15s):We talked about this with Jeff West on the show: in spite of social distancing, and as you've discussed on this call, in many ways, we are more connected to one another than we ever have been before. And this is related to the strains of you're talking about everyone being overworked strains on our attention and our time, and our emotional energy. And nowadays every, every breaking news item seems related to everything else. So in a way it looks like the onset of schizophrenia. You know, like even if folks in the complex systems community are quick to celebrate it as an opportunity for it to be a common understanding in the public imagination of the interconnectedness of our world. It seems like we're sort of dipping our toe over the line here as a species between genius and madness. Michael Garfield (54m 60s):And so how much is too much? In what ways is more connectivity helpful, and in what ways, other than the obvious ill-advised swapping of bodily fluids, would it be useful to try and preserve weaker coupling in our systems? Sam Scarpino (55m 15s):I mean, we could have a whole podcast probably about that. It’s something I've been interested in for a long time, so that we had a workshop or five of us who spent the summer in Marseille. And really, we were just trying to figure how to spend the summer in Marseille. But the question was like, what signal would we see in human social networks of that process happening, right. If this kind of trade-off between the benefits of social connections and the cost of social connections, and especially if we thought it was an out of equilibrium system. And I think it's a really interesting and important area of research that I know many people on this call are working on. And, and so I think those are the kinds of questions that we should be wrestling with as a conflict systems community anyways, but certainly because of COVID because there's going to be increased relevance for what, if anything we can do to try and preserve the things that we think are good about social networks while mitigating costs. Michael Lachmann (56m 4s):Yeah. I mean, I think that from what I saw, I'm now all the time just working on COVID, but kind of what I see from there I think the amazing speed of science as it occurred in the COVID research. I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough on one hand, but on the other hand, right, no one has time to on any question deeply. From what I saw in other fields, kind of on the side, I think that other fields, for example, the field of the origin of life, also started to do like accelerated interaction, like accelerated research over this time. And again, we have, I think after we're done with COVID and we're done writing up all the mistakes we made and all the things we need to learn from this. Michael Lachmann (56m 49s):I think going over the different scientific fields and understanding how much of an acceleration we observed, how much of a slow down, how has it changed? The process of reviewing and looking at papers is I think a big, a big thing that we'll have to learn from this way of doing science. Sam Scarpino (57m 7s):There are something like well over 200,000 papers with COVID in the title since January. And it's interesting because “COVID” is not a word that we used before January. So you can be pretty sure that those were all in the last eight to 10 months. And so it's kind of unimaginable how much information has been generated and put out there by the scientific community. Michael Garfield (57m 31s):Well, that's just wonderful. I really want to thank you both for donating your time to this, to everyone who showed up for their donations in a financial contribution or in sweat equity to SFI and everything that goes on here. This episode will go out on our regular feed in a couple of weeks. This week, we're about to publish our conversation with Artemy Kolchinsky, which is really bizarre and wonderful. So I hope that if you're not already subscribed to the show that you do so wherever you go for podcasts and thanks again, everyone so much for facilitating and attending this discussion. This was immensely fun for me. Michael Garfield (58m 12s):And I hope for you too, as well. Alanna Faust (58m 14s):Yeah. Thank you all. And to reiterate what Michael Garfield put in the chat follow up questions can all, if you're on Twitter, you can tweet about it. You could email me and I can send them on. And thank you for being part of this conversation. Thank you for being part of the SFI community. And I wish you a safe, distanced end of the year -- distanced physically, but not emotionally or intellectually. Bye. Michael Garfield (58m 48s):Thank you for listening.

Thank you and enjoy: Cris Moore (0s):Often, the question is not, how do we solve this math problem? It is this the right problem to solve? And does the data mean what we think it means? And a lot of the data that people train these criminal justice algorithms on, there's a single bit in the data set that says you were rearrested. It doesn't say whether that was because you tried to kill somebody or whether it was graffiti. So a lot of the data sets that are actually being used, don't make that distinction, or let's say you missed your court hearing. Is that because you tried to drive over the Texas border to escape justice, or is it because you were terrified of getting fired from your job because then you wouldn't be able to feed your kid and you didn't understand that if you didn't show up, there'd be a warrant out for your arrest or because you couldn't afford transportation? Cris Moore (45s):And so on. Maybe what you should do is help you show up to court, make sure that you have transportation, make sure that maybe you have childcare if you need childcare and make sure that you get a text message reminder instead of a physical postcard that arrives at the apartment you lived in six months ago. Michael Garfield (1m 24s):It's tempting to believe that people can outsource decisions to machines. That algorithms are objective and it's easier and fairer to dump the burden on them. But convenience conceals the complicated truth when lives are made or broken by AI. We need transparency about the way we ask computers questions, and we need to understand what kinds of problems they're not suited for. Sometimes we may be using the wrong models and sometimes even great models fail when fed sparse or noisy data, applying physics insights to the practical concerns of what an algorithm can and cannot do. Scientists find points at which questions suddenly become unanswerable. Michael Garfield (2m 5s):Even with access to great data, not everything's an optimization problem. There may be more than one right answer. Ultimately it is crucial that we understand the limits of the technology we leveraged to help us navigate our complex world and the values that often invisibly determine how we use it. Welcome to complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield. And every other week, we bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. We kick off 2021 with SFI resident, Professor Cristopher Moore, who has written over 150 papers at the boundary between physics and computer science to talk about the physics of inference and has worked with the algorithmic justice project. If you value our research and communication efforts, please consider making a donation@santafe.edu/podcastgive and or rating and reviewing us at Apple podcasts. You can find numerous other ways to engage with us at santafe.edu/engage. Thank you for listening. Cris Moore. It's a pleasure to have you on complexity podcast. Cris Moore (3m 23s):Thanks for having me. Michael Garfield (3m 25s):Before we started this call, we were calling the shots mapping out how we would like this to go. And I think you make a good point that, you know, spending roughly equal time in theoretical background and like foundation for some of the questions that you're interested in asking that you're asking in your research and then where that takes us into broader scientific questions about half the time there, and about half the time looking at the way that algorithms are applied in society, the questions they raise and the problems they create so that we can land this with a nice sort of everyday practical consideration seamless. Michael Garfield (4m 8s):I'd like to start though by inviting you to talk a little bit about your background as a human being, as a scientist, because without fail everyone on this show, a personal story about how they got into asking the questions that animate and inspire them in their work. How did you get into computer science in the first place? And how did that ultimately bring you into the orbit of the Santa Fe Institute? Cris Moore (4m 37s):Well, I started in physics and so I think growing up, I was raised on the Carl Sagan version of Cosmos, which locates me generationally and that was a fantastic TV show at the time. And what I loved about this show was not just that it let you hear the angels sing about the fundamental nature of reality from elementary particles to black holes and the big bang and evolution, but that it painted this very humanistic picture of what science has for and how the amazing glory of the world around us helps us transcend our national and cultural boundaries and biases. Cris Moore (5m 20s):And what I remember very clearly about it, because this was when something called the Cold War that some of your listeners have heard about in their history books. This was still going on.  Carl Sagan painted this picture that the United States and the Soviet Union and the rest of the world will destroy each other in nuclear hell fire, or we will join hands and travel together to the stars. Either nuclear hell fire or interstellar travel. Those were the two possible is for humanity. Then the Cold War ended and now the world seems more complicated and we've passed over the past few decades from a focus on the threat of terrorism to now the threat of authoritarianism and at the moment the pandemic and so on. Cris Moore (6m 18s):And so the world seems more complicated, but I think that's still imbued in me this strong sense that science is fundamentally a force for good and that fundamentally, we all have to decide what kind of future we want to fight for. And for me, it made me very much want to be on the side of transcending like I said; the boundaries that divide us and working as hard as possible to join with other human beings for a better future, both in terms of abstract understanding and in terms of building a better life for everyone. Michael Garfield (6m 57s):And so utopian goal is brings us to computer science. Cris Moore (7m 4s):Well, sort of. Right then the next thing that happened was while I was getting my PhD in physics, I read Godel Escher Bach by Douglas Hofstadter, which was another amazing touchstone. And I think it was a very, very formative for many people in my generation. And it's still a fantastic book. There's a bizarre lack of female characters, but besides that, it's a fantastic book and it's a very playful exploration of loopiness and self reference from how DNA self replicates to how computers can simulate other computers or themselves to how logisticians, including the great 20th century logisticians like Bertrand Russell and Kurt Godel thought about proving things, including proving things about proofs and how there are. There are unsolvable problems, there are unprovable truths and so on. Cris Moore (7m 58s):So that blew my mind. And I learned about 1930s computer science when a lot of these things were happening and Alan Turing and his heroism in breaking the Nazi enigma code and so on. And then I decided I wanted to catch up on theoretical computer science. And so that became working at the boundary between physics and computer science became a big part of my research experience as a postdoc at the Santa Fe Institute. And then later on as a professor at the University of New Mexico, and then back at the Santa Fe Institute and at that boundary between physics and computer science, there's all sorts of fantastic stuff. Cris Moore (8m 39s):There's quantum computing, there's network theory, the theory of social networks and biological networks. So that's been kind of a big part of my life. And then more recently, I think partly because of all the crises that society is facing right now, including crises of inequality and social justice. I got very interested, like a lot of other computer scientists in the impact of algorithms on society and the way that algorithms are being used in criminal justice in housing to determine who gets a lease, who gets a mortgage or alone as well as who gets imprisoned and who gets released. Cris Moore (9m 21s):And so I found myself working in a much more applied way, a much less theoretical way on how these algorithms really affect people's lives. And here I think the key issue, and we'll talk about this later, I guess, is transparency. And do the people whose lives are affected by these algorithms, understand why they were given the yes or the no they were given, or do they understand what data these algorithms use and how these algorithms work and do they have the opportunity to contest these results and to ask questions like why is this data being used about me and is this the right data and why are we using this algorithm anyway? Cris Moore (10m 4s):So that's another fascinating topic. I guess from theory to practice, that's been part of my trajectory. I still love theory, but, you know, especially as these algorithms get used more on the ground for these decisions that really affect people's lives and livelihoods. I want to demystify algorithms. There's this air of mystery around them. Vendors of algorithms are telling government officials that they should use these, that they're marvelously sophisticated and marvelously accurate in predicting people's behavior. Cris Moore (10m 46s):When in many cases they're neither of those things. And so I want to empower people so that they can understand that both the strengths and the weaknesses of algorithms, what's good about them and what is maybe not so good so that everyone, including policy makers can make better and more informed decisions about them. Michael Garfield (11m 8s):Let's start then in theory, as I think my goal state for this conversation would be to send in the listeners of this podcast into court settings to ask precisely the kind of personally empowered and terrifying to a judge or prosecutor kinds of questions that you're asking, questions that seem to undermine the, the BS that we've allowed to creep into these, the systems in that regard. Where I'd like to start is you gave a series of talks, Turing talks in Bangalore, and you had a related paper up on archive on the computer science and physics of community detection, landscapes, phase transitions, and hardness. Michael Garfield (12m 1s):So I think that this is a good just for people who are as clueless as I am about even sort of fundamentals of what you're talking about here. I think it would be great to talk about, to introduce for us the ideas of how we detect patterns in data, how we detect in particular the noisy data and what kinds of problems that creates. And then what kinds of insights from physics can and have been leveraged in order to, to make sense of these things, looking at the relationship between probability and energy and that kind of thing. I think that's usually a good place to start. Cris Moore (12m 40s):I got into this partly through this idea of finding communities and networks. So this is a popular problem in network theory, people of course have all sorts of rich histories and rich facts about them, what some people might call metadata. You have a location, you have demographics, you might belong to a particular religion. You might belong to a particular, a political party. And then for better or worse, who you link with them, the network might have a lot to do with these things. We have this habit as so as social primates of forming social relationships, mostly with people who are similar to us in many of these ways. Cris Moore (13m 27s):So now imagine that as a scientist, you get to observe a whole lot of links between thousands or millions of people. And now you're trying to figure out, what are the communities here just based on those links, perhaps without any additional information about those underlying facts about people. So this is the community detection problem. And we might assume for instance, we might define a community as a group of people who have nodes in this network with a higher density of links within that community, then between it and other communities. Although by the way, that's not always the case. Cris Moore (14m 9s):So in food webs, for instance, predators eat, pray more than the other predators and economic networks. Buyers might connect more to other sellers than to other buyers. So a community isn't always something with more links within it then between communities, but, that's for a lot of social networks, that's a reasonable assumption. So there are a host of different algorithms, different computational methods for taking a massive network and picking out these communities. But it's fundamentally a high dimensional problem. If you have a million people in this community, then you have a million guesses to make or conclusions you want to reach about who's in which community. Cris Moore (14m 49s):So you're not trying to just to compute a single number or three different numbers. You're trying to compute a million different things, and this puts it in what people call high dimensional statistics. And it's good to remember that even in this age of massive data sets in a high dimensional problem like this, where we have a lot of data, but we're also trying to learn, or we say infer, many, many different things. The amount of data we have per variable, we're trying to figure out might not be so much. So in the social network, it might be, it may be that you only have six real friends that strongly influence you in the network. Cris Moore (15m 36s):So maybe you have a million people, but we only have a small amount of information per person through a small number of connections. This happens in genomics too, by the way, I mean, maybe you're looking at the activity of 10,000 different genes, but you only have 100 different rats because keeping rats is expensive and time consuming. So per gene, you only have a hundred different data points. So again, you have a lot of data, but per thing you're trying to figure out it's actually not so much. Anyway, so in these high dimensional problems, there are a couple of different situations you could be in. Cris Moore (16m 16s):There could be a great shortcut that helps you immediately zoom in on the best solution or at least a very good solution to this community detection problem. And there are a bunch of fast algorithms that, you know, sometimes they work very well on some networks, maybe on others they don't work so well, but there are lots of algorithms out there in practice that you can download and try out, but to find the best solution or to deal with a kind of noisy data set where maybe some of the links are wrong. Some of them are missing. Maybe there's some randomness where people unexpectedly form links with people who are quite different from them, which was sort of throw the algorithm off. Cris Moore (16m 60s):Then in principle, you might have to, in the worst case, go through all combinations of who's in what community and with a million people. That's two times, two times, two times two, two to the million of power, which is an astronomical number. So this is an example of an exhaustive search, which we would really like to avoid, and many of the hardest problems in computer science, the so-called NP complete problems where you're trying to solve a hard optimization problem with many different variables, which are interacting in complicated ways. As far as we know, many of these problems require that kind of exhaustive search and the solution is out there, but you are wandering in this astronomical space of possible solutions. Cris Moore (17m 50s):It gets very hard. What my coauthors and I found in this community detection problem in many others is that as the problem gets noisier, as the connections get more random or as more of the links become unobserved say, or in our rat example, maybe as the ratio of the number of genes to the number of rats that you're trying to figure things out about goes up. So it's getting up to be a higher dimensional problem, as well as a noisier one. There are these examples of phase transitions, which is a term from statistical physics that some of your listeners know, the jump from small outbreaks of a disease to a huge epidemic is a phase transition. Cris Moore (18m 34s):The fact that water melts or boils when it passes a certain temperature is another example. The fact that a block of iron suddenly ceases to hold a magnetic field when you heat it up above a certain temperature is yet another example. So here the noise in the data is like the temperature. And as you heat the system up, you're adding more randomness to it, more thermal noise with things kind of randomly jumping around. And at a certain point, suddenly you can no longer find the pattern in the data. It's almost as if nature is trying to tell you about the pattern, but nature can only do that through this noisy channel. Cris Moore (19m 16s):It's like transmitting a message over a channel with a lot of static in it. And when there's too much noise, suddenly we can no longer find the pattern. It's just impossible. The information isn't there. There are other cases where the information is there, but there's some evidence from both physics and mathematics and computer science that it becomes astronomically hard to find that you have to start searching through this vast space of possible patterns in order to find one that fits the data. So for me, this is a great cautionary tale. I mean, our theorems, our calculations are carried out in kind of clean mathematical models where we actually have the right model of the data. Cris Moore (20m 0s):We have the right model of the noise. And yet even in that very clean setting, there are cases where suddenly we're no longer able to find those patterns. And that's important to keep in mind that our, our ability to find patterns in noisy data is not infinite. There are going to be times when we just, we need to know more or times when our entire model might be wrong. Michael Garfield (20m 27s):I may be getting ahead of our conversation here by asking this, but I remember episode seven, I had Rajiv Sethi on the show and in our conversation around stereotypes. One of the things that came up that seems relevant here, and I'm curious whether this holds water as an analogy that people can apply to daily life was that we come in to an interaction with a stranger, with a set of prior assumptions based upon models. We've built about people who look or act in a particular way. And yet the human world is so rich and diverse and full of exceptions and people are full of surprises. Michael Garfield (21m 11s):And so we get into this problem where to speak to that.   We could solve this if we had unlimited time and computational resources. What Rajiv was saying in this book is that we see these issues where stereotypes rear their head, when we're under pressure to make a rapid decision about someone. And we have to fall back on these faults heuristics. Cris Moore (21m 38s):Like condiments thinking fast and slow when we have to think fast, we often do a rather badly. Michael Garfield (21m 44s):I'm curious if you think that we're talking about the effect of electronic media and in particular like social media as an instance where we're turning up the noise because we're having so many, very low information density interactions with people so rapidly. And at that point, there's a phase transition where we can't actually solve the problem of who this person is that we're actually talking about, or like the opinions that we then developed to fit the data of the interactions that were sort of correlating inappropriately. Cris Moore (22m 22s):I think there's a couple issues there. And some of my colleagues study this more closely than I do, including hate speech on social media, but it's that example of clustering where we connect to other similar to ourselves. Of course, it's very visible on social media. And I think actually the way that a lot of social media platforms, gamify things like likes and upfits and so on actually makes that problem even worse than it is in our natural to the extent we have natural human nature. You know, we are very tribal. We do form strong connections with our friends. We do often initially assume that someone who disagrees with us or who looks different from us, can't be trusted. Cris Moore (23m 4s):And so social media does not, in my opinion, seem to be helping us cross these boundaries. It seems to be accentuating them. And I guess going back to that whole Carl Sagan thing. I'm still very attached to enlightenment values and to the idea that we should all be a little bit tentative in our opinions. We should be willing to change our minds in the face of the evidence. We should celebrate change in our minds. We shouldn't be ashamed of it. And of course, scientists have plenty of ego and tribalism just like other people, but at least the norms that we're taught to live up to, which we try to live up to are to embrace other opinions and to cheerfully admit that we were wrong when that's what the evidence says, which is not something I think that most people in society are even aware of has a good value,. Cris Moore (24m 0s):It's regarded as, "Oh, you're flip-flopping, or you're not sticking to your guns." And we're used to the idea, at least in our society of this advocacy, that the way to come to good decisions is for each side to have an advocate who will be completely one-sided for advocating for their side, never admit that the other side is a point use dirty tricks if necessary. That seems to be how political parties work. And I'm not sure, actually, that that's a good way to reach decisions. So I don't know if the people who designed social media platforms have thought about how to game-ify listening to the other side. Cris Moore (24m 42s):And somehow someone who always agrees with you likes your posts. That should be worth 1000000th of a point. But if someone who usually thinks you're an idiot thinks you've made a pretty good point, that should be worth a hundred points. You should get lots of gold stars for that. And I'm not sure if that would help, but it would be worth trying. But in terms of stereotypes, let's look at how algorithms, including algorithms based on machine learning are being used now in the criminal justice system, because here it's for better or worse. The most fundamental assumption in all of machine learning and most, almost all of artificial intelligence is that the data you have not seen yet is going to look like the data that you already have seen. Cris Moore (25m 34s):The way machine learning works is you have training data stuff where you know the right answer data from the past or whatever. And you train your algorithm on that until it gets most of those answers right. And then you show it the test data and see how well it does on that. Well, now imagine that your training data comes from criminal records in the past about who was arrested and whether when they were released, they were arrested again for committing another crime. So an algorithm which looks at your criminal record and which based on that makes a recommendation to a judge about how you should be treated. Cris Moore (26m 15s):For instance, let's say you have been arrested, but you haven't had your trial yet. Actually most arrests don't go all the way to trial, but you have not yet been found guilty of this crime. And in our society, you're innocent until proven guilty. So do we let you go or do we detain you in the meantime? And to be fair, if you were found standing over your victim with a bloody ax, maybe we ought to detain you. Maybe there's strong evidence that you would be a terrible danger if we released you. On the other hand in the United States, there are an enormous number of people who are sitting in local jails who have not yet been found guilty of the crime for which they've been arrested. Cris Moore (27m 2s):And as they sit there on those jails, it costs the taxpayers a lot of money, but meanwhile, it also destroys those people's lives. They lose custody of their children. They lose their jobs. They can't keep up with their rents or their mortgage payments and so on. So it's tremendously disruptive. And so presumably if we do this at all, which is an interesting question about constitutional rights and freedoms, we should do it only with a small fraction of people who are truly a danger to the public, but who are those people and how do we, how do we find out who they are? Well, human judges have traditionally made this decision by telling people, we'll let you go if you post a hundred thousand dollar bail bond, which is kind of a weird way to do this, because it ends up being based, not so much on whether you're actually dangerous, but on whether you can afford to post a hundred thousand dollars bail bond.  Michael GarfieldMaybe you're more dangerous if you can.  Cris MooreExactly. So as a result, the white collar criminals all go free. And then a lot of low-income people sit in jail and a lot of states, the good news is, a lot of States want to move away from the system and for better or worse, the way the debate is currently organized is instead of these bail bonds, we'll have an algorithm which looks at, for instance, whether you've been arrested in the past and then makes a guess about how dangerous you are to the public, and then makes a recommendation to the judge about whether you should be released or detained or may be released with an ankle bracelet, or maybe released with the requirement to check in with the police every month or every week or something. Cris Moore (28m 44s):So human decision-making is extremely flawed, and there's an enormous amount of statistical evidence that human judges have all kinds of biases, including racial biases, that these are both explicit and implicit, both overt and covert. And it's a huge problem. And there's abundant evidence that people of color in this country and low-income people get arrested much more often than someone who looks like me. And when they're arrested, they're more likely to get longer sentences. They're less likely to be paroled, which means to be released before their sentences is over and so on. Cris Moore (29m 25s):So our current criminal justice system is clearly very biased. So the advocates of algorithms say, well, let's make this objective. Let's make this a mathematical process that just looks statistically at past data and tries to make guesses about future data. And this has led to fascinating debates, not just in computer science. There's a book out by one of our external faculty, Michael Kearns called the ethical algorithm, but also within law and political science and ethics and civil rights. Again, there's this assumption that the future will look like the past. Cris Moore (30m 6s):Now on the one hand, looking at data from the past can teach us a lot. The fact is that most people who commit a lot of minor crimes and even some major crimes are very unlikely to commit a violent act and actually hurt someone while awaiting their trial. If you look at the fraction of people who get rearrested for a violent offense while awaiting their trial, it's actually quite a small fraction. And it's pretty clear that many of the people we're detaining now could be safely released. That way they can get on with their lives, take care of their kids and most of them will in fact show up to court and face the music and the in the court system. Cris Moore (30m 51s):So looking at the data from the past tells us that, and that's good. And that's important on the other hand, looking at data from the past and assuming the future will be like the past, obviously has the potential to perpetuate these biases. So for instance, if I pay attention to how many times you've been arrested in the past, and I assume that that's correlated with you being dangerous. Well, you know, homeless people get arrested all the time and young black men get arrested for hanging out with their friends on street corners, whether or not they're drug dealers. I have never been arrested for heroin with my friends on the street corner. So there is a consensus in this business that arrest in itself is a very noisy, not just noisy, but biased signal. Cris Moore (31m 37s):So what do you use whether you've actually been convicted, it's complicated because there are biases in all of these signals, but many jurisdictions including here in New Mexico are starting to use these algorithms to make recommendations to judges. And I've been working with people in the law department and the political science department at the University of New Mexico. We have this group, we call the interdisciplinary working group on algorithmic justice and it's us. And it also includes several people at the Santa Fe Institute and part of the Santa Fe institutes, larger network of external faculty. So it's great talking with people in law, for instance, because the questions they want to answer about this are not so much about statistics. Cris Moore (32m 25s):They're not necessarily statistical questions about are white people and black people treated with equal accuracy or equal fairness in some sense by these algorithms. And even defining that, by the way, it's very tricky. In law they care about the process. So we have all these things in our constitution and our bill of rights. You're supposed to be able to face your accuser. You're supposed to be able to cross examine witnesses. You're supposed to be able to question the evidence that's brought against you. And so the theme that we've settled on is actually not a technical theme or a mathematical theme, although it overlaps with mathematics and technical issues in computer science. It's transparency. Cris Moore (33m 9s):And if you wish, contestability. So do you, as a defendant, know why a judge was told by an algorithm recommended that you should be detained. Do you know what data about you was used? And do you know why we use that algorithm? Why is this the right algorithm? If it is, do you have a right to question that data, maybe some of the data about you is wrong. It may be that there's something on your record where a charge was actually dropped. Well, that shouldn't count against you, but more broadly, you should be able to question why is this the right procedure? But in order to question that, and in order for independent analysts to measure whether these algorithms are actually as accurate as they claim to be, or as fair as they claim to be, we need transparency. Cris Moore (33m 60s):They should not be proprietary. They should not be black boxes where they're hidden behind a veil of intellectual property. They should be things that everyone can look at them and see how they work, which is not just open source, by the way. open source might be neither necessary nor sufficient here. What really matters is what's the mathematical structure behind the algorithm? What assumptions is it making? What data does it use and how much weight does it place on each kind of data? How many points does it give you for each past arrest or each past conviction and so on? This is fascinating because of course there's a lot of private actors and vendors and providers of these algorithms, many of whom view these as their intellectual property and don't want their inner workings to be known. Cris Moore (34m 48s):But I think in the justice system, that is a real issue. I think that you should not be told by a black box that we think you're dangerous and shouldn't be released. You should at least have an explanation at the very least and the ability to appeal it. So, you know, this is a big issue in Europe. They have their GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation, which has a lot of parts, which are written very badly and by people who clearly didn't understand the technical issues involved, but they tried. People here in the United States are trying to formulate law around this. And honestly, I guess, and here we're really getting into the social side. I'm hoping that by demanding more transparency from the algorithmic side of the system, the computerized part, the automated part, that this will lead to more transparency in the system in general, because we need to gather data about police behavior about, about judges, about prosecutors, about defense attorneys. Cris Moore (35m 48s):We need to gather data about the systems in which we live so that we can all look at it in as clear right away as possible and say, is this fair? And if it isn't, how could it be, make it better? We often think of data gathering as something that the powerful do about us. We think about that with privacy and facial recognition and Amazon gathering our buying habits and so on. But data is also something that citizens can gather about the powerful systems in which we live, more of the surveillance rather than surveillance idea. So in a nutshell, in a rather large nutshell... Michael Garfield (36m 28s):To that point about surveillance, there's a line in that lecture I mentioned earlier from the ICTS, the International Center for Theoretical Sciences, when you're talking about over-fitting you say, we want to understand the coin, not the coin flips. I was just having a conversation with somebody because to, again, date us chronologically, we're seeing a market correction after a large pump to the cryptocurrencies over the last several weeks. And I just heard someone on Facebook say that they were tracking the weekly. Things look like they're going to be really bad by the middle of March. Michael Garfield (37m 11s):Why would you base your assumption? That's exactly what you're saying, not to do. And at any rate when you're in a system like that, where, and arguably any large market in this world where large players have disproportionate impacts, then you have to understand the composition of the eco, the ecology of players in the market in order to understand the market activity and the relative contributions of the various agents involved. And at any rate, that's just over in a corner. We have to understand the coin, the actual build of this machine, and not just the last few weeks of output. Michael Garfield (37m 54s):And so to that, this might be a kind of a hairpin turn, but like in hearing you talk about all of this stuff, one of the things that I wanted to bring up in here, you discuss about computer science literacy is that most of the ways that I hear and read about machine learning being deployed for various purposes is that it's a simple optimization problem. And in this talk, you point that in many cases, the landscapes that we're trying to drape over and fit that to this data to multiple Optima. Michael Garfield (38m 35s):You're looking at an entire mountain range. Cris Moore (38m 38s):And that's even if we could agree which way is up, right. Michael Garfield (38m 41s):We were bouncing back and forth here. I guess what I'm requesting here is a little bit of deconstruction of this simple point of view on optimization, and then how statistical physics. You use that to kind of talk about the relationship between probability and energy landscapes and these models. How you can kind of think about this in terms of thermodynamics and how far you are from the right model is sort of like how much it's going to cost you. And so if I'm getting that right, that does seem like it has more of a direct bearing on the costs we, as a society are facing by applying the wrong models. Cris Moore (39m 26s):Well, let's, let's do theory and then practice like we did before. So on the theory side, there's a lot of beautiful mathematical analogies between statistical physics, which is the branch of physics. This studies, fluids, gases, crystals materials, things with many, many atoms or particles interacting with each other. what many of us call complex systems. That's statistical physics, as opposed to say particle physics, where you're looking at a couple of quirks or something, which is also awesome. But so in physics, things are trying to minimize their energy. Generally rocks like to fall down, although when things are not at absolute zero, which nothing ever is when things are at some non-zero temperature, you also have noise in the system because you have atoms and molecules randomly bouncing around like lots of little air molecules in the room are knocking you around and tiny, but random ways, which you feel as a pressure overall from the gas. Cris Moore (40m 24s):But it's the sum of many microscopic collisions, each of which have a lot of randomness. So there's a very rich theory here. And for instance, in our study of communities and networks, we were able to use this theory a lot where in a block of iron, little iron atoms are in a sense they're tiny magnets on their own. And they're trying to line up with their neighbors. They would prefer to agree with their neighbors. Well, that sounds a lot like that social network. People like it when their friends agree with them on things. And in fact, it goes both ways that tend to make friends with people who already agree with them. So we were able to use these models of magnetism and use their physics to think about, suppose an algorithm is trying to figure out who's in what community it might do that by thinking of each person as a little magnet and asking whether they agree with their neighbors or not. Cris Moore (41m 16s):And indeed, that kind of magnetic system, which is called the Icing Model is a popular toy model of opinion, formation in networks. Then the noisiness of the network is a lot like the temperature. And so I mentioned earlier,  Pierre Curie, that you may have heard of him, he was married to Marie, found that if you heat a block of iron above a certain temperature, then very suddenly it no longer holds a magnetic field. And the reason is that neighbors are still pretty well correlated with their neighbors. But when you go to larger distances, the information doesn't get through. There's too much noise. Cris Moore (41m 56s):And so two atoms that are far apart in the block of iron might as well be completely unrelated to each other. And they basically cancel each other out and it's not magnetic anymore. And it turns out that that's very similar mathematically to an algorithm that's trying to identify who belongs to what community in a network or what data point belongs to this cluster of mice, where that cluster of mice says, "I can't figure out anything here. I might as well just be flipping coins." So there's a beautiful theory there. And you mentioned getting stuck in the wrong place. So the idea of a bumpy landscape, a bumpy fitness landscape with multiple Optima, which if you're trying to go up there mountain peaks, and if you're trying to minimize energy, their valleys, but whichever way you cut it, thery're Optima, and then they have some kind of barrier in between them where to get from one to the other. Cris Moore (42m 48s):You have to make things a lot worse in order to make it better. Again, you're right. A lot of things in society feel like that. And in physics, this happens even in window class. So if you were to look at the atomic level of glass, you would see the atoms in a rather jumbled arrangement, even though the true optimum, the lowest energy state, is a perfect crystal, but the problem is it gets stuck in this jumbled state, this amorphous state, because a couple of items over here are lined up this way, a couple over there, lined up with each other that way. And you would have to do a very painful rearrangement at larger and larger scales to fix it all and turn it into a crystal. Cris Moore (43m 30s):And I'm sure you're thinking of problems in society that are in fact like that. But I think the problem in society is it's even worse than this because we don't agree what it is that we're trying to optimize. If we all agreed on what math problem we were trying to solve, then we can sit down together and say, you know, let us calculate. But the problem is we don't agree on what we're trying to optimize. And we also have a lot of uncertainty about what the consequences of our actions are. And so, unfortunately not everyone agrees that we need to work hard to avoid catastrophic climate change. Cris Moore (44m 12s):Not everyone agrees that inequality in society is a bad thing. Not everyone agrees that it would actually help our economy flourish if people were less terrified of not being able to feed their children or provide healthcare for them, if they lose their job, partly because we don't agree on what it means for the economy to flourish. And so this, this is hard and you see this, let's talk about machine learning and let's talk about AI because when we do the training process of a neural network or a simpler algorithm, we treated as some kind of optimization problem, and we've gotten very good at solving these optimization problems, but what are you trying to optimize even in facial recognition, for instance. What does that mean? Cris Moore (45m 1s):So as I'm sure many of your listeners know, there's a huge controversy about the fact that facial recognition systems that overall have a pretty good accuracy turn out then when you look at them to do much better on one demographic group that another. And so when you read a breathless web article that says this is 90% accurate or 99% accurate well, what does that even mean? Because you cannot generally encapsulate the behavior of these things was a single number. I mean, one example is, you know, suppose that you have a society where 80% of the people belong to one group and 20% belong to the other group. Cris Moore (45m 43s):Well, let's say an algorithm does all this perfectly on the 80% on that majority group and only 50, 50, no better than flipping a coin on the minority group. 80 plus half a 20th 90. So then it could be 90% accurate, woo-hoo. But if you're in that minority group, it's wrong about you as often as it is. Here's another example. There are false positives and false negatives. We all been hearing about this from COVID diagnostic tests and that this happens in criminal justice as well. There was a great jurist William Blackstone, a great English jurist, who said, "I would rather release 10 guilty people than capture one innocent person." Cris Moore (46m 26s):And so he was very concerned about false positives in the sense of thinking that someone is guilty when they're not. Then again, Dick Cheney talking about Guantanamo. "I don't care that we detained a couple of innocent guys. What matters is that we caught the bad guys." So he's much more concerned about the false negatives. He doesn't want to let someone go if they're actually dangerous and these are different types of errors. Some people call them type one and type two anyway, who cares about the terminology. But obviously they have very different costs to society. And depending on the setting, you might be trying to minimize one or the other, or some combination of both. Cris Moore (47m 8s):And that's really a policy decision. That's a philosophical decision. So you can't really wrap up these things with a single notion of accuracy. You always have to look under the hood and find out what people mean when they say the algorithm is accurate. Another example is predictive policing. There's an article that says a certain predictive policing algorithm is twice as accurate as human analysts, humans who are trying to predict when and where crimes will occur. Well, you look at the paper and it turns out what that means is that the algorithm predicted say 6% of the crime and the human analysts predicted 3% of the crime. Cris Moore (47m 48s):Well, that is twice as good, sort of. You could also say that for the humans, 97% of the crime didn't happen when they thought it would and for the algorithm, 94% didn't happen where, and when they thought it would. So you always have to look under the hood and find out what is it. People are optimizing and what lies behind these claims, especially when a private vendor is making them. Michael Garfield (48m 14s):This isn't one of your papers, but I'm reminded in you talking about this SFI External Professor, Thalia Wheatley was coauthor on a piece in Science Magazine, 2018, on prevalence induced concept changes in human judgment. One of these issues is that as you pick up, you're looking for red balls and then as you pick up the red balls, you become more and more sensitive to red balls. And so, why does some social problems seem so intractable? Well, we show that people respond to decreases in the prevalence of a stimulus by expanding their concept of it. Michael Garfield (48m 55s):So on top of everything else you've said, it's the thresholds at which we are gathering data to feed into these. I mean, again, that's perhaps tangential, but I think it speaks to the sticky intricacy of this kind of issue. Cris Moore (49m 10s):Well, it's true that often the question is not, how do we solve this math problem? It's the question of, do we look more deeply into, is this the right problem to solve? And does the data mean what we think it means? In a lot of the data that people train these criminal justice algorithms on there's a single bit in the data set that says you were rearrested. It doesn't say whether that was because you tried to kill somebody or whether it was graffiti. So a lot of the datasets that are actually being used don't make that distinction, or let's say you missed your court hearing well, is that because you tried to drive over the Texas border to escape justice, or is it because you were terrified of getting fired from your job because then you wouldn't be able to feed your kid and you didn't understand that if you didn't show up, there'd be a warrant out for your arrest or because you couldn't afford transportation, and so on. Cris Moore (50m 3s):So if you look more closely at the data, this also offers up a lot of opportunities for positive interventions. And I think again, to a machine learning person, it's all about prediction. I'm going to predict whether you'll commit crime. I'm going to predict whether you'll show up for court or not. And then I'm going to take some action based on that prediction. Well, maybe we should do is help you show up to court., Make sure that you have childcare. If you need childcare, make sure that you fully understand what the consequences to you are. If you don't show up and make sure that you get a text message reminder instead of a physical postcard that arrives at the apartment you lived in six months ago. Cris Moore (50m 44s):So, there are a lot of common sense in things we can do to improve the systems that are a little different from the sort of arm's length. "Oh, let's predict more accurately." So I think the algorithms do have a positive role to play, but I want everyone to feel fully informed about what they can do, what kinds of mistakes they can make so that we can all participate in a democratic way on why we're using them, whether we should use them. And of course, to a technical person, the question is how do I solve this problem as well as possible. But for the largest society, should we be doing that at all? Cris Moore (51m 24s):There might be problems where the best solution is still a human being, warts at all, with all our foibles, but human beings should also be, we should also, like I said, collect data about different judges to see how fair they are, different prosecutors to see how fair they are. And we need to hold up as clear a mirror as possible as we can. Sometimes data is not as clear a mirror as it claims to be, and we should look at it more closely. Michael Garfield (51m 54s):So related to the issue of our desire, our meaning, like Western societies apparent desire to buy into the hype of machine learning. And, you know, there's something about it that sort of, "finally, I don't have to think about this right now." But this is a problem that you addressed in a piece with a SFI Miller Scholar, John Kaag.  You wrote together a piece last spring, right before campus closed on the uncertainty principle and the pursuit of truth. And you, the two of you quote Goethe and talking about how nothing is sadder to watch then to watch the absolute urge for the unconditional in this altogether conditional world. Michael Garfield (52m 46s):This seems related to the issue of the hardness of a computer problem relative to the affordances that were available as individuals or as institutions, and then also maybe how each of us have different heuristics that satisfy the criteria of what feels to us like certainty, what feels to us like a parsimonious or a simple enough answer to a problem to suit our purposes. And so, you know, if we pull out a little bit, a lot of the questions you're seem to me to be questions that have deep implications for the philosophy of science and whether we are actually looking for the kind of elegant, simple math that so many people think of physics being inquest for. What are your thoughts on the desire for certainty, for simplicity, the reality of, of our pluralistic world. It's all of this, this discussion here. Cris Moore (53m 56s):How much time do you have? Michael Garfield (53m 57s):Infinite time, but limited time to edit. Cris Moore (53m 60s):I have several dinner parties worth of thoughts. I really enjoyed writing that article with John Kaag who's a well-known philosopher now with a lot of a number of very popular books. And I think our goal was to say, and this is last spring. Keep in mind, Spring 2020. I actually, we, we started over at cocktails in the fall of 2019 back when there were still bartenders serving cocktails. And we were looking at the rise of authoritarianism and the fact that human beings in many cases want to be released from the responsibility of thinking. Thinking is hard, right? Cris Moore (54m 43s):Thinking that maybe you're wrong about a lot of things is terrifying. I was on the city council of Santa Fe for eight years and I cast some votes that I am proud of. And I cast some that when I look back, I think, "That was really dumb." And you know, there, I was actually in a position of some small amount of public responsibility. And of course, you know, sometimes the wee hours of the morning, I think, "Oh my gosh, why did I do that? Why did I say that?" So facing the possibility that you might be wrong, it's not an easy thing to do. And as we talked about at the beginning, I think in many walks of life, it's not even publicly valued as a norm to be willing to pay attention to other points of view, to be willing, to change your mind. Cris Moore (55m 25s):It's often viewed as a lack of conviction to be willing to do that. And so in this article we were thinking maybe science and even mathematics have something to say to the largest society about how to live with uncertainty because mathematics you think of it as just crystal realm of utter certainty, but it's no such thing. And especially over the course of the 20th century, we realized that there are multiple ways to view the mathematical world. There are multiple ways to view infinity within picture of trends, funded numbers. Cris Moore (56m 6s):You get almost theological disagreements, right? Where some people believe in certain types of internet sets and other people don't. And in mathematics, this has actually led to a certain degree of pluralism of willingness to say, "Oh, well, there, there are different of view here." These are, if you will, different parallel worlds. And both of them have beautiful mathematics and let a thousand flowers bloom. So people, they still argue and discuss about what the fundamental axioms should be, but they're also sort of willing to say, "Oh, you have your model. I have my model. There are different, interesting, beautiful things that are true in these models." That's okay. You know, non-Euclidean geometry is another example. If you drive in a straight line on the earth, well, you'll fall into the ocean, but bear with me. If you try it in a straight mind, eventually you'll come around to where you started. Well, if you do that on a flat Euclidean space, that doesn't happen. And if you and your friend both start in different directions and drive in straight lines, you'll cross each other twice where you started. And at a point on the opposite side of the earth, whereas again, in Euclidean geometry, two lines are either parallel or they cross exactly once. So mathematics actually has some experience in living with each other and not killing each other and not necessarily demanding a single right answer, but rather embracing that there are different sets of Axiom different assumptions from which we can proceed, both of which might lead in interesting directions.  Cris Moore (57m 51s):It's a pretty, distance analogy. But if we don't figure out how to live in a pluralistic society with institutions in which sometimes my side wins and sometimes your side wins and that that's okay. If we don't figure out how to do that, if we insist on winning every argument or burning the whole system down, then the system in which I live is just going to completely disappear. And 50 years from now, we'll just have authoritarian States and maybe a few pseudo democratic States sort of pretending or banyan style things. Michael Garfield (58m 30s):But how robust are those really? Cris Moore (58m 33s):Well, I don't know. Then you have to look another 50 years in the future after that. I don't know. But, even though I think human beings are easily deceived and easily led, I still think some kind of democracy is a good idea. I think we need much more robust discussions with more than 140 characters per utterance, to understand each other and to figure out together what we should do. But I think it would be very sad if the idea of a pluralistic society, a liberal in the classic sense society were to disappear. I guess if people just study more non-Euclidean geometry, then they'll all agree with me. Michael Garfield (59m 17s):I've been thinking a lot about a paper Simon Dideo recently coauthored where he was talking about the multiple different heuristics for simplicity and to bring it back to your work on algorithmic justice, perhaps the question is why don't we have in the courtroom, multiple different algorithms that are like the five blind men feeling the elephant? It seems like this is a perfect example of a place where accepting a pluralistic approach would take us a long way towards solving some of these more abstract problems or routing around them. Cris Moore (59m 57s):That's a good point because the way that these actually, these things actually play out in practice quite often. So I can give you an example. There was somebody arrested in Albuquerque who had never been convicted. And so the algorithm used in Albuquerque, which is called the Arnold Public Safety Assessment named after the Arnold Foundation now called Arnold Ventures. Quite rightly in my opinion, does not count past arrests because as we said, some people are arrested much more often than others. For reasons of bias. It does look at past convictions. This person had never been convicted. There's zero convictions. Cris Moore (1h 0m 37s):So the prosecutor said to the judge, look, I know this person got a low score according to the algorithm. The algorithm thinks they're not that it would be a low risks, release them, but let me convince you why they're actually very dangerous. And so the prosecutor brought evidence, incriminatory evidence and argued that the only reason this person wasn't convicted in the past was that they succeeded in intimidating a witness and that they should have been convicted and so on. And the human judge listened to the human prosecutor and to the human defense attorney and made a judgment call. And in fact did detain that person. That's how legal reasoning works. I mean, you know, you do have an advocate, the prosecution has an advocate and they can bring in evidence on both sides which the judge can weigh. Cris Moore (1h 1m 22s):And the whole point is that it's individualized for better or worse. That it's individualized justice. It's not statistical. It's not based on the assumption that people who look similar to you in some statistical sense that you will act in the same way as those people did typically. And of course, this can cut both ways. I mean, this can give the judge the opportunity to be biased against you because they don't like how you look. It can also give the judge the opportunity to give you a second chance to say, "Hey, you know, I, I see that you have this terrible record, but I also see that you're trying to turn your life around and I'm going to give you a second chance." Cris Moore (1h 2m 1s):And I think that there needs to be space for this type of decision-making, especially where people's civil liberties are involved I think that the basic question of should you be denied your physical freedom. I think a human should always be in that loop again with worts and all. I think that should be a human decision and not a statistical one. So, you know, maybe other things about what type of, should you be recommended for a certain type of followup program or something like that could be algorithmic. So legal reasoning is fascinating. I've started reading like Supreme Court opinions and it's not math, it's not logic. Cris Moore (1h 2m 45s):And yet it does have these internal norms which are hundreds of years old and I guess there are other systems and other parts of the world. We inherited a lot of our law from England, of course. And it does try to uphold some norm of internal consistency. And I think that's quite fascinating and it's not, I don't think it's enough, but it's interesting. I have more respect for it than I used to. Now that I've actually started reading some of it. Michael Garfield (1h 3m 16s):Well, it was like the rugged fitness landscape of an optimal legal argument is rather convoluted, I guess, is what I'm to get out of that. Cris Moore (1h 3m 24s):Well, and, and which legal arguments does the judge in front of you actually respect?  Michael Garfield (1h 3m 31s):I don't know how much more there is to say about this, but I just feel like it's key to draw the connection between a lot of the points that you're making here and identify where they exist in other areas. You know, I think one being Melanie Mitchell and Jessica Flack wrote this piece for Ion a while ago, that was talking about a similar problem in that the metrics that we choose. They mentioned you try to test students for particular aptitudes that students optimize for the tests and then you end up testing the wrong things because the goalposts have shifted KPIs in the workplace are the same. And then it's related to these issues about... Cris Moore (1h 4m 13s):Or university rankings where deans can increase the ranking of your university by spending a hundred million dollars on an athletic center. Michael Garfield (1h 4m 22s):Right. And so to sort of end it here and throw you this and see what kind of bank shot you want to make with it. I find myself perhaps because I am an uncredentialed wild animal living in the temple of SFI in a lot of these conversations about what it means, how like how do we rethink the nature of our agreements around authority and around consensus in an age when the world is changing so fast, that it's sort of like this Pharaoh magnetics model in which things fall apart, that you, you pump the rate of change up too high. Michael Garfield (1h 5m 2s):And that the fact that you got a degree in a field 10 years ago doesn't necessarily mean that that degree is an effective compression of your expertise in that field. And I'm just curious, given the amount of time you spend with these problems, how you look at problems like these problems, like the insufficiency of the genie coefficient, the way that we think about gross domestic product, that like our economic measures are not adequate to the complexity of the world that we live in and where you're thinking on phase transitions and in computational hardness weighs in on how we might steer ourselves to storm some inkling of an answer to problems like these. Cris Moore (1h 5m 47s):I am not an economist, but certainly there's a lot of disagreement about what economic indicators are relevant. And people try to invent various economic indicators that for instance, say something more about how people who are not stock market investors, how their lives are going. The stock market is doing great, but the stock market is not, the economy is so what is the economy and how do we measure its success? But I know a number of people work on on that kind of thing. And I don't know if some of those alternate measures are really catching on and entering the general parlance. We can't even agree in this country whether the deficit matters or not. Cris Moore (1h 6m 31s):These things are at the heart of passionate disagreements that I don't expect to get resolved anytime soon. And I'm not an economist myself. So I'm not sure how informed my opinion is. Michael Garfield (1h 6m 45s):I guess maybe like the desperate question here is, have we crossed the Rubicon as a society or are we going to be able to reconstruct reliable metrics amidst this kind of exponential change that we're undergoing? Basically are we now like sort of chronically and fatally over fit to a lost world? Or what is it in your work that gives you hope that we will find the nuance with which to answer this kind of question? Cris Moore (1h 7m 22s):I don't know. And I don't know what fraction of human beings were actually involved in building that consensus in the past. I don't know what fraction of human beings were actually enamored of nuance and subtlety in the past. We may be looking partly at fictional golden ages that never actually existed. Michael Garfield (1h 7m 48s):Make consensus great again. Cris Moore (1h 7m 51s) I think many of the things that we call societal consensus is consensi we're actually in reality, just consensus is of the elite at the time. And opening up society to people who are not elite is probably a good thing. But that also means alluding to what you're saying, trying to build broader norms of thinking about things and actually listening and actually learning and be willing to admit that you might be wrong. In high school, we teach our students that the scientific method is all this hooey about you have a hypothesis and then you design an experiment and that's not the scientific method. Cris Moore (1h 8m 34s):Maybe a handful of science has actually worked that way. Maybe particle physics works that way, but most fundamentally the scientific method is being willing to admit that you might be wrong and that you don't know everything yet, and that you want to learn more. That's the scientific method. And it would be great to have that be a more broadly accepted goal in society. I'm not sure how to get that across there. There are some glimmers that I like. There's this thing called deliberative democracy, where rather than asking everybody to vote, and rather than having everybody post a little thing on social media, you get like a hundred people from your town, from different walks of life together in a room for three days and give them access to experts and let them ask those experts questions. Cris Moore (1h 9m 28s):Now, of course, I guess they have to believe to some extent in the experts and an expertise, but at least if these are questions like, "How much does it actually cost to run the sewer system?" You know, they can answer that question then what would happen if that pipe falls apart? Well, that's a factual question that maybe they can answer. And I think there have been some experiments along these lines where people who frankly, might not be that thoughtful in some of the standard settings that we have now in society when they get together in this setting and they have the time and the luxury to really go in depth on a topic they often achieve more consensus than you would expect. Cris Moore (1h 10m 10s):So I think that's interesting. I mean, I think that there is still some hope. We are small minded, tribal primates. It's true, but we are also when dragged, kicking and screaming, capable of learning from each other when we have the time to do so when we're not too stressed out, you know, when we have food in our bellies and you know, a little bit of relaxation, we do have the ability to listen to each other and maybe to learn something. And I'm hoping that if we do more of that, and maybe if we create institutions that encourage that kind of thing, that will all become a little bit less certain about our opinions and that instead of two polarized polls, we'll have more of a spread of opinion that can talk to each other. Michael Garfield (1h 11m 5s):That's beautiful, Cris, that was like a good place to end it. Good. Thanks for being on the show. Thank you. Thank you for listening.

Thanks and enjoy: Mark Moffett (0s):The rainforest don't have much in the way of soil it's the soil is very thin and it turns out a primary source of soil and the nutrients in it for rainforest and cloud forest arrives in the canopy in the mist and rain, and accumulates on the branches. So you can have a soil, a foot thick, and the top of a large tree. And I've seen in redwoods, trees growing on the tops of trees out of the soil, in the canopy. So you can have a forest out of view from the ground.  That structural stuff and connection with all these nutrients and where it’s arriving generates a lot of opportunities for diversity. And, those are often studied in terms of gradients or stratification, these aggregate properties, these nonuniform vertical distributions of different things.  So what that means is when you go up in a tree, the ecosystem changes much faster than it does when you walk horizontally on the ground in a rain forest. Michael Garfield (1m 23s):Most maps of the world render landscapes in 2-D, yet wherever we observe ecosystems, they stratify into a third dimension.  The same geometries that describe the dizzying diversity of species in the canopies of forests also govern life in other living systems, from the oceans to the linings of our mouths.  Behind the many forms, a hidden order shapes how organisms live in and on each other. And this emerging discipline of canopy biology may yield important insights into modern urban life. Human societies, like gigantic swarms of ants, are elaborately coordinated super organisms.   In these enormous in-groups one key feature is the anonymity of members.  By studying a tree top world where organisms never see the ground that humans take for granted, structural ecologists glean lessons for the denizens of concrete jungles. Welcome to Complexity the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week's guest Mark Moffitt did his doctoral work at Harvard under Edward O. Wilson; helped fund decades of research with wildlife photography for national geographic; and currently holds research positions at Harvard's Department of Human Evolutionary Biology and as an entomologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.  He has resisted conventional professorship in order to climb trees in over 40 countries and write four books on ecology and evolution. In this episode, we talk about the vertical dimension that theoretical ecology has often overlooked and the fruits of his investigation into the nature of societies, both ant and human.

Thank you for listening. Michael Garfield (3m 36s)Mark Moffitt. It's a pleasure to have you on Complexity podcast. Mark Moffett (3m 44s):Hey Michael, great to be here. Michael Garfield (3m 46s):So my supervisor Jenna Marshall, or our communications manager here at SFI is always reminding me to start my stories and my explanations on the ground and given the trajectory of your work, that seems like the right place to do it. Why don't we start by talking a little bit about how you became a scientist, because I think you have an especially juicy biography to relay to us. Mark Moffett (4m 12s):Juicy, yes, well, I'm a-typical. I have various students ask me how to replicate my career and I say, “I have no idea.” I say the best way of approaching success is through ignorance. Once you know too much, it just slows you down. And so I started off watching ants in diapers, that is as an infant, and I just never gave up and to them they were fascinating. You know, it showed commitment. Most people watch ants in diapers and they give up…I just kept going. And I was a poor student, eventually dropped out of college, but got into a small liberal arts college called Beloit College and got a biology degree.  And I got a book from the science book club, one of three-for-a-dollar by a guy named Edward O. Wilson called The Insect Society. And I thought that was the coolest book of all time. So in college I wrote this guy, my small liberal arts college Beloit, I wrote him from there and he said, “Oh, come by and meet me.”  He had a handwritten note back. And I didn't know you're not supposed to just write professors out of the blue as an undergraduate, but he wanted to meet me, so that was great. So I was on my way to Woods Hole for a summer course and I dropped by and I gave him a big double handshake and called him “Ed”.  I found out later you're supposed to call him Dr. Wilson, but I always called him “Ed”. And we just started talking about ants as if I was a kid watching them in my backyard growing up. And that's what I've loved about Ed Wilson, that sense of joyous wonder that he's never lost. And I got into graduate school at Harvard and started exploring. As an undergraduate I'd gotten to know various tropical explorers. And so I tell people now I'm a professional Explorer.  I’ve been to perhaps a hundred countries, over a hundred countries at this point.  I find reasons to go places and things to do in them, pursuing different questions. And I grew up reading the books of people like Alfred Russell Wallace, and I wasn't from a rich family, but he collected specimens to keep going, and I turned out, I could take pictures. I was very good at it. And so I funded myself by taking these pictures and doing things for National Geographic to find ways of getting out and doing my research. And that was on ants, but also on the structure of forest.  I was really interested in forest and I found out that most of the world's biodiversity was in the tops of trees. So I started doing these tree climbing expeditions and it became more and more fascinating to me. So in any case, I've bounced back and forth between writing and photography and my studies. And I noticed that one of your favorite quotes is by Murray Gell-Mann, “In the 21st century the most important mind will be the synthesizing mind.”  In my mind, that is true. And I like to piece things together and look at things from different points of view; it seems to be what I do best. Like my mentor, Ed Wilson. I'm not a mathematician. I leave that to others.  But I like to bring ideas together from different fields and see how they play out and what can be done with them. Michael Garfield (7m 33s):Well, in light of that, I think we're going to have some fun because that's one of my favorite pastimes. I feel like that's one of the main things that we do here on the show.  For those who are not already familiar with E.O. Wilson, please make a point of doing this for yourself.  Your future self will thank you. One of the books that he wrote that really inspired me in college was his book on consilience, bringing all of these different domains and disciplines and points of view together. And it's a big thing here at SFI to search for, what we called in one of our first books at SFI press, the worlds hidden in plain sight; the underlying universal pattern and order behind seemingly disparate phenomenon. You've written a lot about this. I don't want to jump too far ahead in our conversation, but your comparative analysis of ant societies and human societies is something I really want to get to. But first, I encountered your work through the talk that you gave the SFI seminar on canopy biology.  And this is a really interesting application of this way of looking at things to see the sort of underlying patterns, because this is all about the geometry of forests and where else do we find this kind of geometry in living systems and what kind of research questions does thinking about these systems in this multidimensional way open up.  So I would love to hear you talk a little bit about the move that you made here in your 2001 paper, The nature and limits of canopy biology, and since, to expand the kind of thinking that you were doing about forest canopies into a broader understanding of ecology in a structural way. I feel like this is a good place to anchor the conversation or sink roots, if you will. Mark Moffett (9m 25s):Thanks. Well, I actually gave a talk on this once and Murray Gell-Mann was in the audience, the famous physicist that I just mentioned, and he fell out of his chair during the talk and everyone rushed over to make sure he was okay. And I like to tell people afterwards it was because my talk was so awesome because the canopies are so cool that even someone working on the far reaches of physics could fall out of their chair just hearing about them. But for most people the word canopy means: a cover overhead. That's literally what it means. And that's sort of our anthropocentric bias of what a canopy is, it's a forest.  But, I said, I studied ants, or watched them when I was a kid and ended up studying them, and so my own perspective has been about ants. And when I was climbing up in these trees, and I've climbed some of the largest trees in the world like redwoods, I kept thinking about what an ant would experience. And it occurred to me that even a mowed lawn would look like an enormous structure to an ant. And in fact, I eventually found a paper by a guy named Bastow Wilson, a New Zealander ecologist who died a couple years ago, showing that mowed lawns have all these structural features that you find in rain forests, just scaled down.  But no one studying rainforests or other forests was looking at papers like Bastow Wilson’s. And so I ended up writing a review of our biotropic on the different terms of canopy biology and sort of the features about canopies and the finding in that paper you mentioned, a canopy as being a part of any community of fixed organisms, sessile organisms, that emerge from a substratum. So that allows us to look at all kinds of communities, spatially-fixed communities, and then things get really interesting. So I'll just mention a couple of them before we go on, ones that I didn't know much about because forest ecologists never looked at these, the literature on these things or knew the experts on these things, but there are periphyton, that's pond scum. Do you know much about pond scum Michael? Michael Garfield (11m 26s):I'm currently fighting a rather large bloom of pond scum in my aquaria at home, but otherwise, no. Mark Moffett (11m 33s):Well, I couldn't find much about…there's a literature on pond scum, but I couldn't find what I wanted. So I ended up looking through all these papers on things like water filtration systems. And I found an illustration of the communities that developed in one of these filtration systems, that looked just like a forest, there are all these trunks going up of certain algae species to different layers. And I look closely there were epithetic ones, those diatoms and so forth that lived in the canopy of these microscopic forests.  And even more cool, there were little growth forms called spirogyra spiraled along these tree-like a species looking like vines.  And I wrote the guy who did this paper and said, you know, these look just like vines climbing a tree. And he said, yes, there was an early German paper that described those algae as climbing by circumnutation, which is the word that Darwin used to describe how vines climb trees. And so I'm seeing all these parallels with forests in a community that's the size of your fingernail or the height of your fingernail. And then I kept looking closer at the biofilms. These are bacterial films, largely bacterial films, and they're usually described as films, but I found out that the bacteria in them usually form what are called micro colonies and the cross-section of those micro colonies just look like a forest.  The bacteria create these structures that look like trees that can be at different heights and they wave past each other and they don't fuse. And the ones growing on the plaque of your teeth form structures that look not only exactly like trees, but they consist of nine different species of bacteria that create these trees jointly. So these biofilms are basically showing some of the attributes that we look at when we think of tissues in our own bodies. Bill Costerton, a famous…who started these studies of biofilms, talked about them having homeostasis, a circulatory system, and all this cooperation, like the tissues in our bodies.  And I was wondering how these forests in microminiature compared to our own real forest, the forest that we see around us. And there's a lot of interesting parallels going on that have never been looked at. Michael Garfield (13m 56s):Mm. So a couple of things that came up in thinking about this is how adjacent this is to so much of the research being done on scaling laws and biophysics elsewhere at SFI.  We had Melanie Moses of UNM on in Episode 10 where she was talking about also ant colonies and how a colonial organism, like an ant, represents an approach to adapting to the pressures of trying to make a bigger ant. That eventually it's like there's a phase transition between just going bigger and bigger and bigger and that the ant represents what a SFI, external professor Ricard Solé calls the liquid brain.  So as you know, she's interested in how this works with respect to robot swarms and also three-dimensional architecture of chips. And then I'm just going to keep throwing out stray links and you can latch on wherever you feel an interesting purchase here, but we had Chris Kempes on in episode, 17 talking about biophysical scaling laws as they apply not only to things like the maximum height that the forest canopy could be, but also why we get these thresholds in terms of the amount of ribosome and DNA inside of a cell. And then at what point it makes sense for a lineage of organisms to go multicellular as it has to accommodate the flows of information and energy within it.  So there's a lot here on why it is that we see these patterns over and over and over again, and what these patterns might be telling us about the way that systems have to manage the metabolic processes. It seems like the gateway to complex systems thinking, the big sign on the front of this rabbit hole, is something like looking at the image of the river delta and the human cardiovascular system and the forest canopy and seeing the similar branching architecture. So studying ecosystems in the structural way, for starters opens up a question about biogeography in general and how we measure diversity and the relationship between this three-dimensional structure and diversity.  And I feel like that's a key point that I'd like to hear you talk a little bit about, because when you look at Google maps or whatever, and it's supposedly showing you these gradients between different ecosystems and the color of the map, and that's just not at all doing justice to the complexity of what you're describing. Mark Moffett (16m 29s):Yeah. Well, Chris Kempes has done some really interesting stuff there with how communities should be structured. And this to me is a big question because when biologists usually are talking about structure, they mean some kind of a metaphysical or abstract sense. There's actually a big gap in what we know about the actual physical structure of these systems. And those structures are a scaffolding on which everything else lives. So they're very important for that reason. And the fascinating thing for me, for example, with biofilms, and it may be true to some extent for other systems, is they start off very competitive.  There are different bacteria land on a surface, and they're killing each other and doing the old Darwinian thing. But by the time they've sorted it out, things become a lot more cooperative. And arguably that can be true of other systems too. You know, this brings us back to like Lynn Margulis’s way of looking at ecosystems. And there's a guy Mark Bertness at Brown, who looks at seagrass communities and others in terms of the cooperation between these species to create structures. One species can take in nutrients, expel, excrete certain things that the next species can use and so forth.  And by the time they sort out themselves in space you have a pretty efficient system going. And that is indeed part of what can generate the biodiversity we see around us. And that to me is what's really valuable here about thinking about these canopies; about the canopies of all these different kinds of ecosystems. You can't follow a forest through time in your lifetime because it takes too long. We can't study a lot of things about forests.  But we could potentially use things like biofilms as model systems to study to the assembly rules for physical structure and the dynamics of forests.  And no one's done that, but it could be easily done. So problems that are intractable in forests can be addressed using these shorter, faster growing systems.  Much like using lab rats as substitutes for studying health and people.  So that to me is really a possibility that is begging to be addressed. And I'm hoping to get a group of experts together to brainstorm about this across these different systems, across these different ecosystems from coral reefs, to kelp forests, to microbiologists, to rainforest guys, and even people studying maybe mowed lawns, because they're all addressing the same questions.  And they're probably having solutions that will interest each other, but no one's really meeting each other. They don't know each other for the most part, these different experts. Michael Garfield (19m 30s):So one of the things that you mentioned in that seminar and also links to, not that this is an advertisement for Chris Kempes, but you know…this whole episode…but you know, Chris just wrote a paper with Marcus Hamilton and Robert Walker on how, much as you see a rise in diversity among mammal species as you approach the equator, you also see an increase in the diversity of human cultures. And they were looking at this relationship between biological and cultural diversity in light of the scaling of social interactions as an environment becomes more and more diverse. And you've said this several times through your work about, and this is again, kind of pegging into what I hope we can talk about in the second half, which is the attractor basin of social living.  Why it is that we'd go for these and so one of the things I found interesting about the talk that you gave was about how you see a similar gradient from the forest floor to the canopy.  And that there is a significant difference…like you'll see organisms that have a range that extends great distances in either direction, North, South, East, West, but only maybe a few feet up and down. And that the tops of trees miles away look more like each other in some cases than from the top of the tree to the base of the same tree. So catch me if I'm getting this wrong, but it seems like a big piece of that is because more sunlight, but also more branches.  And so the frequency of life at the top is faster….more smaller animals having more kinds of interactions. Mark Moffett (21m 13s):Well, no one's actually proven this to any degree. It's very likely. Internally there are differences in biodiversity between systems. Like a mowed lawn for an ant may resemble a rainforest, but a mowed lawn won't have as many species. You do need that space of a rainforest to accommodate all that diversity. A biofilm can actually be quite diverse just because the organisms are small relative to its size in something like a stromatolite. But the actual location of this diversity has to do a lot with nutrients and energy cycling.  There's productivity advantages to being attached to a substrate. You can take in nutrients that are flowing by you in a way that say an algae free floating in the water can't as effectively.  So these different systems have nutrients and energy coming in in different ways. So, terrestrial plants have nutrients mostly coming from the roots and light from above. And that's true of sea grasses and certain algae, but for most algae and corals, everything's coming from above. Most algae don't even have roots and so the inputs of all these different valuable resources are coming from different directions depending on the system. And as they arrive, particularly, for example, in rainforests they’re a little different than most forests that we think about North America, because actually a lot of the energy is up there because, you probably have heard, that rainforest don't have much in the way of soil.  The soil is very thin and it turns out a primary source of soil and the nutrients in it for rainforest and cloud forest arrives in the canopy and the mist and rain and cumulates on the branches. So you can have a soil a foot thick in the top of a large tree. And I've seen, in redwoods, trees growing on the tops of trees out of the soil, in the canopy. So you can have a forest out of view from the ground. And so that structural stuff in connection with all these nutrients and where it's arriving, generates a lot of opportunities for diversity. And, those are often studied in terms of gradients or stratification, these aggregate properties, these nonuniform vertical distributions of different things.  So what that means is when you go up in a tree, the ecosystems changes much faster than it does when you walk horizontally on the ground in a rain forest, because as you go up, it gets brighter and brighter, more sun, and nutrients are different and often richer. And so you have to look past all this complexity, of course, this messiness, because forests are messy, trees are dying and living and you can’t often see these strata very readily, but when you tease it out, you see these patterns that are, that are absolutely fascinating. You see the same thing in a kelp community.  A kelp forest is said to have five layers, like a rainforest is usually described as having fire layers. No one knows particularly why, maybe it's the way that light gets filtered out and what's left by the time you get to the bottom is usually one or 2% in both cases. So these patterns are an important part of the whole question of where biodiversity comes from in the world, the patterns of three-dimensional structure, allowing one spot of the ground to contain a lot of diversity of habitats overhead. Michael Garfield (24m 45s):Your talk, as you alluded to right before we started recording here, that there are just, it's so rich, there's so many different trees, conceptually, that we can just jump from one to the next. And one of them that you lighted on for a moment in this seminar, which we've linked to in the show notes, is about how these little worlds, these microclimates that occur at different heights in the stratification of a forest ecosystem, or a canopy of biofilm in your mouth, that at different heights there's different little worlds.  And in a rainforest, you pointed to the fact that there are all of these organisms, jumping spiders and dart poison frogs that have these very, very small brains that are nonetheless navigating these labyrinthine typologies, you know, like how are they finding their way around?  And then how, because of their small size, how does physics operate on them differently? Some of these organisms have a sense for the Z-axis, how far they are off the ground and some of them don't. So that touches in on a couple of different things I hear discussed at SFI a lot, one of which is the adaptation of inferential systems. Like how does an environment shape the intelligence of an animal and the way the algorithms by which it orients itself and navigates its environment?  And then the other is kind of more or more basic question about, I forget, who it was that came up with…you probably remember that famous quote about if you throw a rat down a well versus if you throw a horse down a well, Mark Moffett (26m 43s):Oh yes, I know this one…it’s J. B. S. Haldane…You can drop a mouse down a thousand yard mineshaft, and on arriving to the bottom it gets a slight shock and walks away. A rat is killed, a man is broken and a horse splashes. I say this during lectures.  The point there is that…one of the important points is that for most canopy species height doesn't matter. We're obsessed with height. We're afraid of heights. Humans don't look at things the way most canopy species do. It matters to us, but most canopy species don't care how high they are, what they care about is the resources there.  And sometimes those resources correlate with heights. So there are lizards that will stratify, they’ll be at different levels relative to the temperature. And it's hotter near the top of the trees, of course, so they tend to be high up.  Or they may prefer a certain kind of branch, a certain branch width. And it turns out after a hurricane, there's a guy named Doug Reagan who studied it after the hurricane, all the Anolis lizards came down much lower to the ground because the branches were there, they were broken up above. And so the lizards care about the width of the branch or the temperature and so forth, not the height. And the really interesting study there to show this was by, Francoise Shank, I believe her name is, in Switzerland. She compared rats versus marmosets determining how well they determined heights or knew how high they were. Rats, which live on the ground, kept a very close track with how high they were and a marmoset, which lives in the tree, didn't know what its height was, just didn't care. It just moved around where the resources were. So if you live on the ground, you're not used to this universe where height doesn't matter. You're dealing with resources that are just separated at different heights and so forth, and that's what's important to you. Another thing, if I just plow on here, is the architecture of all these things.  Because that's really fascinating. It turns out there are only about 30 ways of making a tree around the world. A friend of mine, Francis Hallé came up with these models originally, I think 26 of them…and I found a few more in the seventies.  And these structures determined, sort of, the architectures of different kinds of trees. So if you walk through a forest here and you decide which tree to climb, you're going to usually pick a tree that has the right configuration of branches and so forth…and canopy animals are presumably picking such trees. And then along the trees that are ideal you can get well beaten highways that go from tree to tree that have probably lasted for generations. We don't know how long they last and how often they change. And so those structural features determine the life of many of these creatures. The tree can pick its architecture presumably, or evolve an architecture to either attract certain animals or repel them. And the odd thing is though that we study rats and mazes, we pick these artificial mazes. What we need to do is understand the world of these species. We should be looking at tree architectures and seeing how different species respond to those kinds of mazes. And I think we will get some really interesting answers there, but in terms of how most of life treats three-dimensional space, no one has done that.  But some of the smartest animals turn out to be some of the smallest.  Jumping spiders is one of my favorite groups.  And jumping spiders are little spiders that don't build webs, they hop around.  And it turns out they have extremely good vision. And they'll hop through the vegetation and let's say one sees a fly that it wants to catch, it will scan around, look at all the different twigs around the fly, back up out of view and do what's called a detour, moving around until it finds another view of the fly, leaving the view of the fly entirely (most animals would forget where the fly was) and then it'll keep moving through the branches until it gets to the spot where it can leap and catch the fly. So it can actually move through some very complex spaces and remember all these things.  And jumping spiders can do amazing things, they're smarter than lions, tigers, and bears as far as I'm concerned, but that's certainly one of them. Michael Garfield (31m 8s):So yeah, this question of what life is like, what the world-space of organisms living in these environments seems to have a consilient pin back to the practical dimensions of human existence in the story that you gave about lizards sleeping on the ends of branches, on leaves, where they can sense predator vibrations. And, you know, I was thinking about that and about investment or like sensitivity to go out on a limb makes you vulnerable in some sense, like conceptually it's not a robust platform, but it's uniquely tuned to like a sensitivity to criticism.  I don't know, maybe this is a lark, but  it feels like I noticed you cited George Lakoff in one of your papers and Metaphors We Live By and his work on embodied metaphor is something that has really inspired me over the years. And he talks about the way that we think as terrestrial mammals, we think of up as more because we're used to seeing piles of things. And I was thinking, you know, if you were an, anole or an iguana, maybe you would orient yourself conceptually in terms of your distance from the trunk and the amount of vibration to which that makes you susceptible. I don't know. That's a very short shovel for a very deep well. Mark Moffett (32m 32s):There's like 50 things to say there, but one of them, to get back to the beginning, is why I saw canopies in this new way, in terms of thinking about them, in terms of all ecosystems, and that's the realizing that words create what Oliver Wendell Holmes called the topography of ignorance. If you think of canopies in terms of forests you don't realize you're being anthropocentric; you don't realize that ‘up’ can mean a mowed lawn to an ant or ‘up’ can mean a biofilm to a bacterium. And then the question of all these movements within it and how different animals and plants respond to it becomes critical.  How they navigate these geometries. There's a lot of overlap here with thinking about cities and so forth. Luís Bettencourt is someone I've corresponded with a lot about different things. And what's really fun is that plants act a lot like animals in rain forests in the canopies, there are philodendrons in your dentist's office that look quite bland, but in forests they actually wander through the trees. They lose their root and they stay a couple of meters long…and there's a guy named Tom Ray who studied the fact that they wander through the trees looking like a snake going in slow motion. And if they get to the top of the canopy and get stuck at the end of a branch, they will drop a long leader shoot over and try to reach the next tree literally again and again, reaching over until they can nab the other side and pull themselves over.  So they're like a snake crossing from one tree to the next.  And snakes in the canopy are very thin and for that reason, they have to get around between these gaps and also very thin so they can spread out their bodies and remove all the signals that they would have if they were thick bodied, so they can sneak up on lizards at the ends of branches without waking them up. So small lizards sleep on the twig tips, as you said, to keep the snakes from finding them and the snakes have to approach them very delicately to keep from vibrating the lizards. So all these things are interconnected. You know, it's hierarchical that part of the biodiversity of a forest is that things are within things are within things.  So there are sloths on trees on which there are certain mites on which there are smaller mites, you know, the worlds within worlds idea; that's part of this diversity. And the other part is Dan Jansen had a paper once on trees as islands. And indeed, I call it patchwork biogeography, each tree can have its own community of herbivores and so forth, different from the next tree. And on that basis, in fact, Terry Erwin came up with a first estimate of the number of species on earth, 10 million, far larger than anyone had thought before, because he had fogged the trees, knocked down all the insects using a fogger, pesticide, and found huge numbers of new species up there that varied from one spot to the next. And the recognition is that the forest is basically a patchwork of islands from one tree to the next, each one can contain a different community and all these different sub-communities within it and all the different layers within each spot and so forth. Michael Garfield (35m 50s):So now that we are standing here marveling at the similarity of patterns across scales, something that you were talking about, the intergenerational paths left by animals, between trees and along  trees, seems like a really excellent bridge, if you will, the metaphors themselves being the intergenerational pathways that allow us to cross from one region of this conversation to the next into your work on societies and human societies and adapting your insights from a lifetime of entomological study and ecological study to some of the deep questions about what it is to be human and what it is to live in a society.  And like specifically in this case, I'm thinking about the way that these scent trails and other forms of asynchronous communication create these structures in the environment that function as cognitive accessories or adjuncts. And when you participate in the informational structure of something that exists in this way beyond your lifetime, then the question of where the individual really rests, like where it is appropriate to coarse grain, if you will, your study of human beings makes it look less and less like it's actually the individual skin encapsulated person that we're used to thinking of as a human being.  And you start getting into just how much of me as an individual is actually scaffolded by the city that I live in or by the culture in which I participate. So I'd love to hear you talk a little bit about your book, first of all, The Human Swarm, and then how these two worlds, the human world and the world of canopy biology, linked to you as someone living in the concrete jungle of New York. Mark Moffett (37m 44s):Well, I'm a hands-on guy. I like to see things in the world, that's why Alfred Russell Wallace is sort of my idol and even Darwin for his years in the field. And so, I'm out there, I'm climbing the trees, I'm thinking about ants and their experiences, and I've also lived with different tribal groups and hunter gatherer groups. And I came up with some thoughts that I built into a paper a few years ago in the Journal of Human Nature and developed into this book.  To boil it down, being social is often being confused with being a society. People are talking about social and society as the same thing; they’re not the same.  Jane Goodall, when she started working on chimpanzees, didn't see any boundaries to them; they interacted off in the distance as far as she was concerned. And then suddenly in the seventies, after years of this belief, they started killing each other. And it was clear that there was a territorial boundary that was formed. And one society had turned into two. And it led me to the notion of a society as a definite group with a closed membership. It's a special kind of in-group versus out-group. So we're talking about societies as discrete groups, holding territories with a shared identity that separates them from other groups.  And those societies last through the generations and their membership is involuntary. So, you're born in society, usually expected to stay in that society and your grandchildren will be in that society. And so on that basis various animals have societies, and I argue that humans had societies since the beginning, starting with nomadic hunter-gatherers to horticultural tribes and chiefdoms to states. And so that was sort of the starting point of the book. And it was actually kind of a controversial point of view because even for sociologists, there's often talk of ‘imagined communities’, this idea by a guy named Benedict Anderson and Irish political thinker. And his idea was that societies, modern nations at least, were products of the mass media.  They were imaginary. But societies are all imaginary. Even for the chimpanzees Jane Goodall couldn't detect what was going on in their heads when they turned into two groups, but something switched and you ended up with two groups. And that's a really important thing that happened with that chimpanzee group. And it happens with human societies that split over time as well. So most biologists now are obsessed with network thinking, where there's a lot of talk about networks, not group thinking and societies can't be decomposed into networks. You couldn't ever figure out the boundaries of China through social networks. For one thing, there are lots of Chinese that interact with the Americans, for another thing, there might be hermits that never interact with anybody. So it isn't the cooperation that defines these groups. It's people's responses to group traits and their patterns of network connections or different things. Michael Garfield (40m 54s):So, in thinking about the analogy between ants and humans, a couple of things come out. One is the relationship between scaling of social interactions and diversity. And you raise an interesting question in some of your writing about why it is that this does not seem on the first pass to actually be a universal law. You give the example of Argentine ants that don't appear to be as specialized in these enormous super colonies that extend over vast regions of space. And in that case, there's something about the properties of that network that do not result in diversity.  And I'm curious if you have any thoughts as to why that is and whether that has to do with the third dimension of that colony or, or what Mark Moffett (41m 43s):Oh, n-dimensional ant colonies, I love it. But yeah, first of all, ants have very clear cut society boundaries, colonies. And most ants that we come across have nests. The one colony has one nest, and so it's localized, and you might have a leafcutter ant nest in central America with a million ants, but there are other species like this Argentine ants that can have billions of ants in the colony with clear cut borders, where they fight with the adjacent colonies, but you can move an ant from within those billions, you can move it for miles (because these colonies are huge) and drop it off again,  and it will be just fine because it's still home. It still has the identity of that colony. And it's the borders set by identity that determine one colony from the next.  Commonly, when you look at ants and you see for humans as society get bigger, and then in the case of humans also cities and dense local populations, you get more complexity, but the Argentine ants have very simple societies. They don't have division of labor with the workers doing different things. Very, very minimal if at all.  And they're not building a lot of infrastructure, not building complicated nest, they don't have assembly lines like leafcutter ants do to process food.  But that's also the case with some human societies, the Huns and Tartars of the Mongolian Plains had much simpler societies, despite the great expanse that they occupied. And so what that tells me, or suggest to me, is that you need a huge number of people to build a skyscraper, but that doesn't mean that a huge number of people needs to build skyscrapers. There are ways of living despite the size of the number in your population that are both simple and complex, successfully, as populations get bigger. So you can have simplicity in large societies and complexity and both can work. Michael Garfield (43m 49s):Is that like an energy density thing? I mean, I'm not sure about where this is in Argentina, but I know quite a bit of that area is rather arid. Do you think that it's for metabolic reasons that we don't see skyscrapers in this? Mark Moffett (44m 4s):No, no, it’s actually a different strategy. It's a very successful strategy. What you have, the Argentine ants, which are originally from Argentina, an invasive species from there, what they have is a very plastic way of doing things that becomes impossible as societies settle down and build all these structures and invest in all this stuff. And the Huns and Tartars were the same. They didn't invest in stuff. And that made them very mobile so they could move swiftly in all sorts of directions and take over space. So the Argentine ants can swiftly occupy any space that's available. They're expanding in California where they invaded us a hundred years ago and they've been expanding and expanding and they're still expanding on the new ground and they can move swiftly anywhere they want to go. They don't need any particular configuration, they just need holes in the ground.  As long as there's enough moisture and not too much moisture, they're fine. So this plastic approach to life is simply a different strategy. And one, that's not much appreciated since we're all living in cities now, so we tend to think that way, but it's much closer to mobile hunter-gatherer point of life, but scaled up. Michael Garfield (45m 20s):Hmm. So I guess just thinking about the conversation I had with David Krakauer back, it was one of my favorite episodes of this whole show, Episode 29, and we were talking about adapting to catastrophic change: mass extinctions and market crashes, and so on.  And time and time again, this pattern is…you know, a virus has a high rate of mutation because it's constantly moving into a new environment. So I guess, would that be the kind of thing that you're…you're saying that they've managed to stay essentially light on their feet, small organizational footprint, low bureaucratic overhead, in order to manage the possibility of all kinds of different environments into which they can migrate. Mark Moffett (46m 4s):I have a paper coming out in the Journal of Organization Design, looking at ants and human businesses, which was fun to write. And there are a number of different things going on here. And one of the important ones is the lack of leaders and hierarchies in ants in general; not just for the Argentine ant with these huge colonies, but ants in general, don't rely on leaders. They have temporary leadership at best. An ant can guide its fellows to food when it knows about food, but otherwise there isn't anything like that going on; there's no centralized control. And that means that ants respond locally and move quickly as a result.  It makes it very hard for competitors to bring down a colony. An ant looking at human organizational design would say, “Gosh, isn't the only thing I have to do is to blow up the White House and you'd all be in chaos.” And ants have no White House, they rely on various forms of exchanging information locally to get things done. That's why you can step on ants in your kitchen till the cows come home and they'll just keep coming. They won't be stopped. Michael Garfield (47m 16s):So, it was actually reading this paper that led me onto this, this line of questions for you. One of which is, I love your statement here: “As for the ants, inability to grasp the totality of what's happening in its colony. The same can be said for the CEO of a major company. Though clearly the CEO operates at a vastly higher plane of reasoning, he or she nonetheless relies on underlings to distill a sweeping view of the organization.”  And this is where we touch in on Jessica Flack’s work. Jessica Flack being the one who brought you in for this talk and her work on collective computation and studying primate hierarchies, and so on.  This question about, at what level is it right to actually start talking about the cohesive behavior of an organization?  And then how is that happening? You've mentioned in relation to this, that the limited behavioral repertoires of ants might represent a functional adaptation to colony life rather than be due entirely to limitations of brain size. I'm thinking about how the human brain has shrunk over the last 40,000 years as we've become…  (speak for yourself)…more and more quote unquote civilized, right? And that, again, it gets back to the way in which we're now embedding computational processes of living in society in the society itself that we're capable of…was that Robert Heinlein that said specialization is for insects. And yet human beings resemble insects, as you argue here, really quite a lot.  So, I'm curious what you think about all of this as it relates to some comments that you made recently, one of the excerpts from your book went up on Nautilus and you were talking about how a global unified human polity is probably a pipe dream.  That diverse human cultures intention with one another are probably here to stay. And I'd love to hear you unpack that a little bit as it relates to what it is a society is doing in this way about collective computation. It seems like what you're arguing is that society's intention with one another are necessary for an even greater sort of super social collective computation. Mark Moffett (49m 33s):Well, I don't know if they're necessary and they might have a happy byproduct of that, but you know, there's a core thing for me going on here and that we tend to be focused on cooperation. And I said social networks earlier, but rather than identity, and societies are about identity. That means your worst enemy can be in your society. And you can be best friends with someone in another society. And yet you still have a clear…your psychologists show how our brains compute these memberships these in-groups and out-groups, these differences, automatically. And these are important to humans. They're basic to our sense of who we are.  There's all kinds of negative ramifications when we have biases about these groups, but they're not going to go away. They're actually…our responses are built into us faster than the blink of an eye, you register people's group memberships and without you even knowing it. So once you have these groups, and very few organisms have what I call societies.  Sociality is very common. So you're going to have bats flying out of a cave by the millions or birds in these giant flocks, but they're not in societies. They're not a well-bounded group with a sense of membership. Once you have that, you can have all kinds of advantages that are particularly built in to having a set membership.  You can talk about group selection a lot more effectively, which is I think something that we need to look at more in terms of these group memberships.  We can look at all kinds of individual things that make a difference, like the talents of others in that group that can make up for your own deficit. If you hang around the guy or gal that is a good hunter, you might get more food if you're bad with the bow and arrow and so forth. And societies provide with these dependable memberships, they provide a stable foundation for close relationships of all kinds. So now, now Michael Corleone in The Godfather, I think Part Two said, “Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.” So having enemies in your society is part of the deal.  No society consists of a bunch of lovely friends that get along together, in hunter-gatherers right to societies of today; and we're talking about humans. And even ants can have what amounts to disputes in their societies. So societies aren't about cooperation. So intelligence is definitely something that doesn't have to do with being in a society. In fact, societies tend to give us the opportunity to be dumb. As you mentioned, brain size in humans has been declining for a while. There's a social brain hypothesis by Robin Dunbar, but those networks or friends that he's talking about that can grow as societies get bigger, are always within societies. Societies never consist of just those friends. And when you look at intelligence, he talks about brains getting larger as their networks of friends get larger, actually it's solitary species that are smarter than social ones.  And there are studies of bears and weasels and other solitary species compared to social species and our species in societies and solitary species tend to be able to tend to be much faster and solving puzzles, presumably because they have to be self-reliant.  Once you're in a big group and your neighbor can make bread and the other neighbor can give you a ride to work. And all you have to do is the one thing maybe you're really good at, like repairing shoes. There's a lot of less strain on your brain. Michael Garfield (53m 12s):So with respect to that, this is something we've talked about on the show before. I think I brought this up with Brian Arthur in Episode 14, because we were talking about global economics and how as we automate more and more of the economy, and as economic networks grow to coordinate activity all over the planet, that it obeys these broader scaling laws in that you see more and more of a network, as it grows, devoted to distribution of resources. And you wrote in one of these papers about how larger and larger ant colonies you see more and more lazy ants. And you mentioned research on how these, this acts like a reserve pool, that it allows the colony to respond, to shocks, like the army reserves where suddenly they may need a huge groundswell literally of, of new units.  So that's like robustness, right? The robustness of a system being kind of a measure of the replaceability of its components. (Right). But then there's this other part that I talked about with Brian Arthur, which was that it seems like the larger a system gets the more it has to push, actively push, nutrients to the ends of its network. And like you see like the heart of a whale relative to the size of its body compared to the heart of a mouse relative to the size of its body. And so there's this notion about like maybe as these systems get larger, they need to get lazier. And that's where he brought in the idea of universal basic income, like a giant heart that actually has to actively pump against the gradient of wealth condensation created by a network. Mark Moffett (54m 55s):Well, one thing about larger… Luís Betancourt and colleagues, like Geoff West and so forth, have studied how efficient larger and larger cities are. And that might apply to ant nests as well. And what you have as societies get bigger and bigger is you have the capacity of generating much more reserve energy and so forth. So you can support individuals that do less or do it only at particular times for particular reasons. So this big reserve force you see in many ant colonies could be drawn upon when there's a war and otherwise, you know, I'd like to be reincarnated as one of the lazy ants as there are other ants in the colony that work like the dam.  And you can watch those all day, at a small colony you can usually pick out which one it is. And if you remove it, not much happens for a while until someone else picks up the slack. And there's also the question, an interesting question of the organization within societies and Marilyn Brewer and then Linda Caporael are two psychologists who have written about the basic group sizes at which humans seemed to function. There were pairs of people like your spouse or your boss and you, there are small groups like hunter-gatherers, there’d be like a hunting party, and other would go out hunting that day.  And in modern terms it might be a wake place, collaboration between a few individuals. And then there's groups of like 30 or so, which is pretty much the size usually of a classroom or a department and a company and so forth.  And in hunter-gatherer times that was a society of a band; group of individuals that would camp together and they'd interact in other ways and these little hunting groups who go out during the day from the band. And then finally there are the groups of…these two psychologists describe groups of, you know, hundreds to thousands, which are like conferences, schools. And at that point you start developing relationships that are much less personal. They're more anonymous and symbolic. So you're kind of contented with this kind of abstract joy of being with fellow colleagues who study this thing at a conference. Most of the smaller groups are more personalized and those different size of groups might be processing things in different ways.  Collective computation goes on in different ways between these groups and it may be efficient or a hunter-gatherer ancestors that lived in these roving bands. Each band might be trying out new things and doing its own things and not necessarily communicating much with other groups that actually belong to the same society and come up with their own solution. So societies have this information structuring within them that may lead to greater efficiency of the whole. Michael Garfield (57m 52s):Yeah. So, you know, to, to double down on this question about the structure of society, as it serves information processing, I want to call back to conversations I've had with Eddie Lee on the seemingly ineradicable persistent nature of cascades of violent conflict in the world. Vicky Yang came on and talked about how we cannot help but create outgroups that human beings have this cognitive bias that works against moderates and gray area people, you know, people who want to occupy the middle of a conveniently easy binary grouping.  And then when I had Albert Kao on, we talked about the role of stalemates and how, you know, stalemates can improve the collective computation of a, of a society, which I think was a callback to earlier work that Jessica Flack and David Krakauer have done on conflicts of interest. So everywhere I look at any level, it seems like some amount of internal opposition, internal conflict is actually necessary to the success and the cohesion of these groups. And so I'm curious, given that there are so many different dimensions along which human society can cooperate or not what you see as the lessons from this analogy to what's possible for human beings.  I mean, I think you argue very compellingly that a sort of planetary unified government is not terribly realistic, but how do you imagine, especially given the way that our balance of synchronous and asynchronous communication involves, like you said, being a part of both geographic and intellectual communities, as well as societies that have these diffuse boundaries, where are the nodes of possibility as you recognize them? Mark Moffett (59m 53s):Well, there's obviously a bunch of ways to go there. One thing I will say though, and one of the conclusions of my book is that societies are always ephemeral across all species and through human history, there's a clear pattern of growth, but then break down and reorganization. So surviving populations of humans have gone through this umpteen times and every generation has thought they were in the most amazing society that would last forever. We all believe that. But in fact, I look at these things in the book in terms of changes in identity over time, I talk about societies and identity, as I mentioned, and those shifts and beliefs of who we are happen in different ways for hunter-gatherers and for people today.  But they are impossible to stop. We're constantly shifting our perceptions, even as we believe that those perceptions might be stable, they're shifting under our feet. And so those cycles are a part of human life. We're going to have to learn how to deal with that truth, I think, more than anything.  It's a struggle that we all have. And to get back to one thing you said though, and one of the interesting things about humans is that within societies, we have all kinds of personalities. You have the five aspects of human personalities that psychologists study, including how adventurous we are on so forth and there are all these personality types.  And we're looking at these personalities types and other species even ants now. And why do they exist? What is it about them? And I would argue that we need to study…that mixture of personalities, determine how societies function. There were actually some really interesting things I saw on hunter-gatherer literature from early people visiting hunter-gatherers, describing: here is a band of hunter-gatherers where all the friendly ones got together. And here was a serious group over here. They were all part of the same societies, but they were sorting themselves out by personality. So what does this add to the mix as it were of our social behavior? One thing I talk about in the book and I have it in a small essay for something called Project Syndicate online, which is a called Divided We Stand, which is on patriotism and nationalism.  And those are distinct, but variable expressions of how humans identify what their society and they're found through all societies. So the question is why do we have patriots and nationalists? And it's obviously a source of conflict today because nationalists tend to take on a much more rigorous view of who belongs and try to exclude outsiders and patriots tend to be nurturing and so forth. But it turns out that even ants have, within their colonies, certain species have been studied to have these sort of range of types with some individuals nurturing the young, spending their energy there and others constantly fighting.  And if you have too much of the fighters, the young starve, if you have too much of the nurturers parasites invade the colony, so you need both. So an interesting possibility for humans is that we have to have these mix of personalities for societies to function, even though they don't get along. Ideas emerge from our head, not through everybody getting along, all those neurons can be fighting each other for different views to percolate into our conscious minds. So the struggle part of the society, the dissonance in the society, can be just as important as the cooperation. And maybe these personalities are part of that. Michael Garfield (1h 3m 42s):That feels like it gets us right to the last question I had for you, which again draws from this as yet unpublished article that you wrote for the Journal of Organization Design, you address in that the, the role of errors, the role of mistakes, in novelty. So I'd love to hear a little bit about the errors in the collective computation of society and how that kind of, if you want to call it noise, that allows an evolutionary algorithm to jiggle itself into surprisingly beneficial outputs or whatever.  You know, how there's so many different ways that this kind of thing has studied, but I'm curious how you wrap your head around it. Mark Moffett (1h 4m 30s):Yeah. Well, ants make mistakes. It's hard to believe it when you watch them of course, they all look very perfect, but you know, ants make mistakes. What ants are often doing are things in series parallel. All these individuals are doing the same thing simultaneously, which allows for some sloppiness. I mean, if you live alone, you can't afford to make mistakes. But if there are a hundred individuals out forging at once and they're all following a trail out to food and one of them leaves that trail by accident, wanders off and finds a different source of food…it's a happy mistake. So this is one reason why big brains may not actually help ants.  And there's a paper Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control by Rodney Brooks, a friend I love, about making many small robots rather than one big cumbersome robot and ants have done that. They have all these tiny units. And if you look at an army and colony in Africa, all the neurons and all those ants in the same colony, add up to about the number of neurons in the human brain, but they've split it among all these individuals that are dumb, actually fairly smart in some ways, but pretty dumb. And yet this is a way in which they can get things done without investing in one big unit that would fail catastrophically on its own.  So mistakes, I think, occur as a useful attribute of a lot of systems. And are part of this question of a specialization and other questions we've looked at all relate to these issues as well. Michael Garfield (1h 6m 14s):I know some folks at Google that are probably listening to this and are aware that the affluence generated by the, just the sheer scale and the increasing returns to scale of a corporation of that size allows for a lot of money to get thrown at complete experiments, (R and D departments), right. Yeah, the R and D scale's at least the ability to bounce back from a mistake seems to scale super linearly with an organization, but as it is with ant colonies, so too, it is with human organizations that there are more small companies than there are large companies. So, the question, I guess, if we're going to leave this with a practical takeaway, is how, based on this analogy, do you imagine a smaller organization being able to optimize itself for error formation? Like casting back to the first half of this conversation and thinking about how a smaller animal can take a bigger dive out of a tree without breaking itself.  Do you see, do you see any strategies for being able to boost the reservoir or the capacity for innovation in a smaller organization? Mark Moffett (1h 7m 26s):Well, I can do a little bit of comparison with ants. And one thing that's really interesting about ants in general is the emergence of complexity as societies get bigger, in general, we talked about exceptions of ants that don't quite follow that rule, but in general, you've got all kinds of complexity coming about as societies get bigger and bigger and bigger.  And then a small ant colony, like a small hunter-gatherer group, like a small company, you have less ability to make mistakes. If you only have one person…if you're a military unit and you only have one person that knows how to operate the radio, because you're all specialists and that person gets hit by mortar fire, you may be doomed.   In the large society, you might have hundreds of people that know how to use that same radio set. So by definition, smaller groups have to be more conservative. But the bonus of being a human that makes us special is that we can collaborate between groups, including between societies and between corporations within societies. And in fact, human corporations rely on all kinds of collaborations. They don't make all their products from scratch. If you're making an iPhone, you're relying on hundreds of different companies to bring in the different goods and services required to put it together.  Ants can't do that, ants are absolutely nationalists, if you want to put it that way.  They attack all enemies. Everybody outside the colony is an enemy. So we can have outgroup friendships, including across all kinds of organizations that bind us together in ways that make things possible, that are unheard of in the history of life. Michael Garfield (1h 9m 15s):So I guess we have an extra layer. Fascinating. Mark, first of all, thank you so much for taking the time. I know it's been a long time in coming. I've been really looking forward to this. (Hey pleasure.) As parting thoughts and, you know, pick one or both. One is where is this line of inquiry taking you now? What are you excited about? And then another is what is your advice for people who get excited hearing you talk about this kind of thing, and want to learn more? Mark Moffett (1h 9m 41s):Well, I sometimes see graduate students now that walk out of the Biolabs blunder into a tree and wonder what hit them because they're stuck in front of some high tech equipment or building models, and they're not relating it to broader issues in the world. And I would say those techniques, the models are important, but to try to go out there and build these connections between these disciplines.  Whether it's different parts of ecology as I've been trying to do with canopy biology, and I hope to be able to do eventually by getting a group together to actually discuss some of these issues.  Or with society's big issues, like what causes groups to stay together and fall apart.  And those are questions that transcend psychology and anthropology and biology, and gets us back to my mentor, E.O. Wilson's idea of consilience, which you brought up, but which is trying to bring those disciplines together around common goals and themes to develop new ways of thinking and solutions to problems. Think broadly, don't be afraid to think broadly, that's it in a nutshell. Michael Garfield (1h 10m 56s):Excellent. Well, from here on my tiny narrow branch emits the vast perfusion of cool ideas, I want to thank you for being on complexity podcasts. Mark Moffett (1h 11m 9s):Yeah, thanks for giving me a random walk through various things that was fun. Michael Garfield (1h 11m 14s):And I really hope that you get to make it back out into the field this year. Mark Moffett (1h 11m 20s):That's true. I had a lot of plans. I'm I was another aspect of your question. I was planning to look at the society is of a variety of species in different parts of the world, which, you know, as I say, I like to get my hands dirty and I'm in New York now, so my hands are much too clean. They're actually Purelled. It's horrifying. Michael Garfield (1h 11m 39s):Thank you for listening.

One tiny tweak can lead to massive transformation, set the stage a slightly different way, and the entire play might unfold differently. This path dependency shows up in both the science fiction premise and the hypothesis of scientific research. What if we just break that one thing here? What can we learn about the hidden order of our cosmos by adjusting just a single variable. Welcome to complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. Michael Garfield (1m 8s):This week, complexity becomes its own experiment. After an invasion by our sister podcast, interplanetary festivals, alien crash site. SFI Miller Omega program manager, Caitlin McShea joins as guest co-host for a conversation with SFI fellow Tamara van Der Dose for a three-headed conversation, totally be fitting the subject matter, a work of speculative sci-fi science produced by over a dozen of SFS postdoctoral researchers during a 72 hour lock-in complex systems charrette. Their question, how might an extra terrestrial civilization much like our own work if their biology required three parent families. We discussed the interplay between individual and society, the role of counterfactuals and speculation in both scientific research and sci-fi and what technology Tamara would hope to find left in the wake of an alien visitation. Tune in two weeks from now for a return to our regularly scheduled programming and check the show notes for extensive followup resources, including links to subscribed alien crash site. Michael Garfield (2m 14s):If you value our research and communication efforts, please consider making a donation@santafe.edu slash podcast, give and or a rating and reviewing us at Apple podcasts. You can find numerous other ways to engage with us at Santa //fe.edu/engage. Thank you for listening.  You know, maybe the right place to start this conversation is the fact that this is a three-headed monster. You know, that the dynamics of a three-party conversation are impossible for Isaac Newton to predict so that just having three people in one chat like this automatically brings us to nonlinear dynamics. And here we are squarely and immediately in complexity science  Michael Garfield (2m 58s):We're ready for failure. We're ready for a huge explosion Tamara van der Does (3m 0s):Is what you're saying? We're not afraid of failure. Michael Garfield (3m 4s):Failure is learning right. Well, great. I think this seems like the right place to start. Tamara, tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you get into science? What, what drove your burgeoning curiosity? Tamara van der Does (3m 18s):I also kind of have to explanation of what brought me to science. There's like maybe the more real one on a human level. And then the more academic one I've always been interested in people. So that much was clear and just like, why do people function like they do. I also love pop culture and can just look at it and try to dissect it as much as possible. And I think I was definitely drawn to questions that I worked through in my PhD from mostly being in France with like a very large Muslim immigrant population and kind of seeing a lot of my peers who are like, Oh, I'm, I'm a feminist. I don't follow the rules of my parents, but also I'm a Muslim and I wear the veil and all these things are who I am. Tamara van der Does (4m 2s):And I was like, Oh, this seems contradicting, but also awesome. And I want to understand how people kind of find who they are in this environment with multiple cultures that are contradicting with each other. And so that was definitely a question from a long time ago that brought me to graduate school to study these questions. But then the more human side is that, you know, I graduated in 2010, the economic recession thought I was going to work, maybe do social work. I hated it. And then I freaked out and my boyfriend said, maybe you should do grad school. And I said, but in what? And he said, sociology. I was like, Oh, that does sound fun. And here I am. Michael Garfield (4m 45s):So you fell into SFI. Tamara van der Does (4m 48s):Yeah. And I also applied to the PhD program at Indiana University thinking it was a master's program. And then I got a letter that said you have funding for five years. I was like, Oh, okay. And I think I did graduate school the right way in that I always thought I was gonna leave the next year. I was like, Oh, I'll try this out. But once I got my master's I'll leave or once I'll teach a bit, I'll leave. Once I do qualifying exams, I leave. And so it felt less daunting. It was more step-by-step and eventually I was like, Oh, I really like research. I'm almost done. Might as well finished. And the program I was in is a very like classic sociology department. Tamara van der Does (5m 29s):So unlike a lot of people at SFI, I was in a very strong department culture. So it was very not interdisciplinary. It was like, here are all the sociological classics. Here's how you do applied stats for sociology purposes only, and cure you are now a perfect sociologist. And so it was really great that mere tech kind of took a chance on hiring me from such a strong sociology only background and seeing the connection with her work. And since then has been a lot of learning, a lot of learning and very exciting stuff. Michael Garfield (6m 2s):Mirta Galesic is also a cultural transplant, right. And so I think there's a resonance there. And especially as it comes to work that you both do, and the relationship between the cultures that a person has to navigate their identities and their belief. And I think it would be helpful to spend some time on the exposition of that and like how it is that you study the relationships of those factors. Tamara van der Does (6m 24s):Yeah. So there's kind of, I guess, two ways or multiple ways to look at it. But with Mirta we focus a lot is on this psychological idea of dissonance. So, you know, when you have conflicting beliefs, how, what do you do to change them? And this is kind of a classic theory in psychology of belief change and what she and Henrik and Yonas have added to it at least kind of statistical physics framework to understand this dissonance using this icing related models. And so seeing, Oh, it's not only dissonance, but also how much you feel this dissonance, how much you pay attention to it, et cetera, et cetera. Tamara van der Does (7m 6s):But this is not right. This is not just by itself. You and your little mind. So it's you your mind, everything you think about, but also the larger social environment. And so a lot of the models we're working on is how do you incorporate both the social environment and people's minds to try to predict or understand people changing their beliefs. And then what I kind of am a bit more interested in is like the social environment, even better, bigger, so like culture and how does culture kind of creates what kind of beliefs and what kind of identities you can have in the first place. And so creates kind of these ways that you can be understanding you can be. Tamara van der Does (7m 47s):And then at the same time, how different people influenced by that then can change themselves, these bigger cultural elements.  Caitlin McSheaCan you be a little more particular about exactly what types of beliefs you're looking at in this large environment? I think a particular example would be really helpful for me to wrap my mind around this large thing you're examining.  Tamara Van der DoesThis is very vague. Yeah. So I think with Mirta, we're focusing on beliefs about scientific issues, for example. So here is like really beliefs about vaccines, beliefs about gym, food. How do people form their beliefs? How do people understand it? And so you can see, okay, you might think I am against vaccines because I also believe in these other related things or all my friends are anti-vaxxers, but also it's what the government pumps out, what you see in the media. Tamara van der Does (8m 33s):How do you understand yourself? I don't know. I'm some more as a hippie. And so what does it mean for you to believe or not believe about vaccines, about other identities you might hold, things like that? Something else I would like to look at is also going back actually to this question of feminism and trying to see the relationship between feminism and religion and that when do people hold onto these two things that are important to them when they choose one over the other or, and why kind of life changes might affect that? Caitlin McShea (8m 56s):Well, so when you talk about something like how feminism informs a decision towards belief in a religious system or vice versa, that seems like a really good example of the types of trade offs. I imagine people would experience as their beliefs change like in real time. Have you experienced any similar overlap between for instance, like a trust in science during a time like COVID pandemic and a different type of behavior? I mean, I don't think feminism is one, maybe I'm incorrect, but it seems like I can think about it in the framework of being trapped inside quarantine during a pandemic. Caitlin McShea (9m 36s):But how does that relate to, for instance, the way that we select our policymakers or the way that we behave with our neighbors and determine who gets to come into our pot and who doesn't.  Tamara Van Der DoesSo you're saying how kind of beliefs about trust in science then informed your actions or...  Caitlin McSheaI'm guessing there there's clearly a feedback that you're looking at between the individual's behavior and decision-making in a, in an environment which includes other individuals. Yeah. And so when I'm thinking about quarantine, it's like, who do I allow into my pod? How much does something like their belief in science factor? It would seem to me that those are tethered, but it would also seem to me that this person has a, has a different belief system than I do, but they're empathic in a way that I needed my group. Caitlin McShea (10m 17s):I don't know.  Michael Garfield (10m 18s):Love to stack on that also that when we talked to the Sam Scarpino on complexity, you know, he had done some work and also had done work on the overlapping relationship between networks of different kinds in, in the influencer formation of behavior. We also talked about this with Jeff West in terms of the way that our social networks reorganize when we're no longer seeing people in person and how, rather than your, your neighbors, which is sort of heterogeneous, as far as like belief systems or affinity groups, we end up online where social networks are determined, sort of by homophily right. It's like you're seeking out and you're, you're driven by algorithm to associate with people whose ideas are more like your own. Tamara Van Der Does (11m 3s):Yeah. And I think that's kind of an interesting point as far as how much yeah. How much having to choose fewer friends or making this decision of pods could change how beliefs spreads, how identities of form, and even trying to think of what if this had always been the case and like what kind of society would actually, what have, would we have just like a lot of tinier identities or would beliefs not change at all because it's all these disconnected little pods. I think that's a very interesting question. I haven't really put that much thought into studying that, but I really liked thinking about how this could affect things. Yeah. Michael Garfield (11m 43s):So that's a hook into this question, that animated, the really interesting project that we're here to talk about today, which is the 72 hours of science project, the SFI fellows were involved in, in 2019. It seems like forever that I've been wanting to talk about the Sunday show since like the first episode. Caitlin McShea (12m 4s):It feels like yesterday to me, I have to say, because we were so close to bringing it to like a public forum with interplanetary. And then we were going to try to figure out this experimentally evolved book thing with ASU. And so it's both very far away. I'm very proximal. Michael Garfield (12m 17s):Yeah. But so the question about the role of counterfactuals or, you know, alternate histories or, you know, change one variable and see what happens. There's that relationship between science fiction and the role of speculation in forecasting and in civilization design. And then this other thing, which is, you know, the way that science is practiced as an, you know, an intellectual enterprise. And I'd love to hear you speak to that. Tamara van der Does (12m 42s):So 72 hours is something that's been happening at SFI for a few years. Now that actually Chris Kempes, and his cohort of post-docs first did. And the idea was based from, I think it was a 48 hours of movie where they made a movie in 48 hours. And the idea was to do the same thing with science to try to show, okay, this, try to bring a bunch of people together and make one paper in 72 hours. And they did that for two years. And the two papers are online. One is published, I believe. And it was very cool that they came up with a whole paper and did all the analysis and writing all in 72 hours. Tamara van der Does (13m 23s):And when it was, are you, we thought, Oh, it'd be very fun to do a 72 hour project again. And this time we decided all this maybe pitch ideas beforehand. So we have a little bit of a direction of way to go. And I really tried to find what I wanted to do for 72 hours. And I was like, I don't want to do just a model of like, Oh, look, these two things are similar or all here, some simulations. I was like, I want to do something fun. And so I came and I had a very vague idea. My only idea I proposed was like, maybe we don't have to make 72 hours actual scientific paper, but maybe it could mean more story. I was thinking something in between like the Little Prince and Sophia's Choice when maybe somebody would go from planet to planet. Tamara van der Does (14m 9s):And like each planet would have like one physics law broken until you would learn about it and get to learn about science or complexity through that. And people really liked that idea. However, a lot of people still wanted the experience of learning about how different people do science. I mean, I think it's a very exciting group we had with some physicists and biologists, A philosopher, some social scientists. And so people were like, we still want to know how we each do science and do a scientific inquiry together. And so then the idea was like, let's write a paper, but from the perspective of alien scientists explaining their planets and we doing the 72 hours, did a long brainstorm on what this would be. Tamara van der Does (14m 54s):And we came to a planet that needs three parents for reproduction. And I think the whole counter factor is especially interesting because we, in the process of working through this project, we came across a paper actually by Perry in 2017 that used the previous paper modeling the benefits of biparentalism by Kondrashov and Perry. And I were like, Oh, you know, it seems that actually tri parental reproduction could be more effective. So this was an actual paper that came out just two years. They know, but nobody cared about it. It's like, why would you worry about this, given that this is clearly not the case on this planet? Tamara van der Does (15m 35s):And we're like, this is genius. And actually it's very good. And it makes sense that as far as like making sure that like bad mutations, don't just like expand. It will be better to have three parents, but given the situation on our home planet, when you maybe need better corporation and that there's not too many mutations, two parents still seem like a good place to be. Michael Garfield (15m 60s):Yeah. So, so that key idea, I feel like in a lot of this research, the notion of historical contingency or, or path dependency and the way that things get canalized or entrenched by the vagaries of historical unfolding. And so we've got this situation, like you said, where it's like, yeah, there may be some contexts in which three parents is actually a better approach, but that's not what we have. Tamara van der Does (16m 24s):Yeah. The path dependency is pretty huge. Even now linking it a little bit more again to my work, for example, with Vicky coming up with a motto of categorization, but just like once people have been categorized based on one, you know, specific characteristics in your life is based on that. It's really hard to move past this. And so I think this is something that each country that has many cultures, many genders, many sexual orientations is trying to deal with is like, now that we have made these categories based on sometimes genetics, sometimes not, it's like, what do we do with them and how do we move forward? And there's a huge, yeah, there's a huge path dependency. And you can say, Oh, these things are socially constructed. Tamara van der Does (17m 7s):They're not actually real. It's like, yes, but now we're kind of in this world.  Caitlin McSheaWell, what I think is interesting to you from the counterfactual perspective of something like a 72 hours, because as you said, it was a diverse group of individuals, practicing science from all different realms. And so I think that one can immediately imagine how difficult it might be to find two partners to make a baby and think about it in that kind of a sociological sense. But you also have, you know, physicists and biologists and mathematicians and philosophers examining a potential mechanism for which the genetic material doesn't mix. It has to actually breed instead of spin. And so it just, it covers like all scales of imagination, which I think is really cool. I'm going to presume that there wasn't a mechanism proposed as to how the genetic material became tripartite or was there,  Tamara van der Does (18m 12s):Oh, there definitely like a whole section on like three branch chromosomes and how they would like interweave with each other as like the wall behind you, if there's, so I think that was one, there was the development of gametes asymmetry, which was also quite fascinating. So what kind of, so I don't know if, you know, for example here, this gamut assymetry given like the egg sperm, different size type of situation. And so here we're like, Oh, what would be the gametes asymmetry? And it seems like the best would be one bigger two smaller ones. And so you had, yeah, you had people working on this people drawing chromosomes and at the same time, people writing about cultural mixing and how maybe they offspring of people who have three parents would have maybe more capacity to hold on multiple language, multiple cultures. And here again, this is something we did not explore, but I was talking with Yonas who started sadly after 72 hours, started here at SFI about how maybe you would have been nice to look at these models of belief, dissonance, and identities, and maybe see, okay, what if people had a lot more ability to hold on to contradicting things within them because there were so used to them from birth. Michael Garfield (19m 10s):So, you know, to that point in tying back into the first piece here about a belief and identity, when we had Vicky Yang and Henrik Olson on the show, one of the papers that we discussed was a paper you co-authored Falling Through the Cracks, the Dynamical Model for the Formation of Ingroups and Outgroups, and much has been written about the way that the eruption of Intercontinental trade during the Renaissance. And, you know, the, the so-called rational enlightenment led to greater tolerance between people and the emergence of new subtleties of psychological complexity, people being able to move between different value systems and different social persona. Michael Garfield (19m 54s):And there's this question that the section that you just mentioned in this paper on cultural mixing under try parental reproduction, I think you said David Kenney was primarily in charge of this piece. So there's, there's this piece here where I think this is this, this ties into your paper with Vicky and Henrik about where he writes at some point, the cognitive load of maintaining multiple cultural identities becomes overwhelming. And that's true, whether you're in a two parents society or three parents society that it's like, there is a minimal psychological complexity required to navigate an environment. And the dissonance that you're talking about generates ingroups and outgroups. And so like the speculation here in this paper is that the culture ends up becoming homogeneous because it's too much work to try and shuffle all of these. Michael Garfield (20m 44s):And I guess, you know, that's, that's, that's, that's like, it's, it's interesting in terms of questions about, again, what is happening to us online and how do we navigate the proliferation of partial identities in this way? I'm curious what your thoughts are on all of that. It's a big bite to chew, but I'd love to hear what you think. Tamara van der Does (21m 4s):I think one thing to remember is that also people are not just little ponds moved around, taking in these identities and beliefs. I mean, there's a lot of agencies still and a lot of agencies of like what you want and also what people with more power really want. And so I think once you add that to the mix, it's very hard to predict what will actually happen. And so one of my projects is actually looking at a more looking at textual data. So Google books or congressional speeches or newspapers, and how these places decide to construct different ideas about who counts as like us Americans and who is not. Tamara van der Does (21m 47s):And so they are delimiting, they are creating the conversations. I was like, what are these categories in the first place? And so there's a lot of agencies and different actors who have specific goals in making sure that maybe there is a homogeneous culture. Like a lot of people want all of America to be United for like power or something, but, you know, in some people want more, want to create divisible groups. And so I don't know. Adding this to the mix makes it more complicated to predict, like in this case, would you actually have a homogeneous culture or once you have all these small groups online, what, what happened? I think there's still a big push by politician. Some to try to unite some, to try to divide and I'm unsure, uncertain what would actually happen in the end. Michael Garfield (22m 33s):Well, just to offer another speculative link back to Jennifer Dunn just gave a really beautiful Memorial lecture on the legacy of ecologist Bob May a former chair of the SFI science board. And like, we're going to, one of his contributions was showing how as an ecology becomes more and more complex, it becomes more and more brittle or susceptible to collapse in certain ways. And so it does seem like that's kind of what Kenny is suggesting here. Tamara van der Does (23m 0s):Yeah. I think what really interests me here in the 72 hours more than like applications for society is just this, this exercise of trying to see, okay, if we change what things, what are all the far ranging consequences, both on biology and from society and what could emerge out of that. And this alternative world is really what drew me to propose this project and what still makes me excited about it. And if you find that this could be, if we could do this every year.  Caitlin McSheaYeah. I want to, I want to talk a little bit too about the origins of 72 hours and how it's shifted by this proposal. Because as you say, it was originally inspired by the 48 hour film festival, which is to say like, what can we accomplish under this very firm limit and was like, we, we lock ourselves in this crazy place. And I think the crazy geography that you occupied for this project is worth mentioning like practically an alien landing pad. So there is something like meritable about having to push yourself against this wall in terms of deriving creativity. But what's interesting about your project is that the resources were limited in terms of time. You had literally 72 hours, you couldn't leave the house and you could only work with the people who were in your group, but at the same time you chose to do an almost creatively imaginatively unlimited project. And I wonder how, if you could speak to how you approach that, because I guess this is why I was interested in the DNA question, like how clever to you have thought up triple parentalism and then reconciled all of the science that you practice in a way that's still navigable from like someone like myself who understands the earth DNA, but it's still like, how do you get that third string in there? Caitlin McShea (24m 35s):How do you get the communication? It's through the golden record? Like, so some of the unlimited newness was tethered to certain artifacts themselves that we, the audience can engage with. And I wonder if you have anything to say about that. Tamara van der Does (24m 48s):Yeah. And I think that was, I should say the premise , yeah the whole story was these aliens coming by earth, coming into the Voyager, seeing the golden record, being like, Hmm, interesting, two parents and then studying reverse engineering, our methods to get all the data from our planet to read all these academic papers and send back the report within 72 hours. I think those constraint more nice as far as telling the story. I thought, I think it was very hard at the beginning because it almost is unlimited which directions you can go with this kind of prompt. And I think it made it harder actually for social scientists, because you can literally, you can go and billions of direction. Tamara van der Does (25m 35s):And it's a little bit hard to know where to start. So we really try to narrow it down by first coming into, okay, how would this happen and what would lead to a planet where this is the case. And so that helped us narrow the focus of the 72 hours by looking at, let's say, everything is the same. What would make it so that this is true in another planet, given all the laws we know. And, and I think through that, we were able to just, you know, go step-by-step okay, you need three parents. Okay. You need three mating types. Okay. What about gametes size? And then you build on until that, and then afterwards, it was really just picking and choosing a few things that seem interesting to people to explore, but this really kind of helped narrow down the, why would this be rather than all possible consequences? Tamara van der Does (26m 30s):But I think in a way it really worked well as far as bringing people from different disciplines together, because I think it's very hard to work on a project with like 14 people who all come very different backgrounds. And so here, it was a little bit easier to actually be like, whatever you can do, do it, but do it within this very broad constraint, which is three parents. Michael Garfield (26m 56s):We would be remiss without mentioning that we live in a world now where three parent babies are possible and that while this doesn't obey this the same sort of genetic dynamics of the speculative race in this paper, that some of the same sort of sociopolitical cultural, psychological outcomes here may be swiftly moving, like so many other things from the domain of science fiction into a matter of mundane concern. I wonder what your thoughts are on that. Tamara van der Does (27m 26s):Yeah. I mean, I think that was also useful in this project was to focus a bit more on the biology side of it, because I do think that actually having three parents or having actually a whole family taking care of it, of you has actually been the norm here and there for many years. So I'm not sure that was like a key and that interesting difference. I think really the biological side is the uniqueness. And then if you have to have there's biology cool side, then it leads to maybe some differences and disease spreading or marriage rates or cultural shifting, but really having three parents in a household that is actually not that different from, you know, a lot of different possibilities on earth. Caitlin McShea  (28m 11s):And let's not forget the near usage of the word thrupple in the actual scientific paper, because there is such an example in the world that we occupied. Like, I love that. Michael Garfield (28m 21s):This may not make it into the final cut, but I do think it's of note that you and Artemy Kolchinsky, your, your partner who's also at SFI fellow once presented at SFI for slice of science on Burning Man. And that burning man is where I went to learn about like polycules and non-binary identities and forms of human intimacy. I think we've, we've stepped way off the path as far as the show is concerned. Tamara van der Does (28m 51s):But I, I think part of me, I actually wished we would have gone further is a weird term, but I was like hoping for some more major differences in like the kind of maths or truths that this other planet would have. So I think we went for something quiet biological, and it actually did. I was a math undergrad, but I was at a Christian college and my senior thesis was Is God above Math or Math above God. I love that question. And I really also inspired, but quite a bit of like Greg Egan stuff, thinking about different maths and different logics, it kind of could attacking each other. Tamara van der Does (29m 34s):I mean, how cool was that? And in here, was part of me still wants to do a project that is maybe more the Little Prince, but with like kind of deep mathematical truth or not true. And how would that work? But I think that would take more than 72 hours.  Michael GarfieldMaybe worth mentioning a little bit about, I think, are you talking about Permutation City, Greg Egan's novel.  Tamara van der DoesDark Integers.  Michael GarfieldSo yeah, it might be worth just, just giving people a little bite to chew on it that.  Tamara van der DoesDark Integers or their mathematicians are not biting against a logical invasions from alien. I mean, that's pretty much the premise. Tamara van der Does (30m 15s):There are a few small stories also as well, but this is like the major thing. And so you follow these groups of researchers who are like realizing that things are right with their super computers I believe. And then yeah, it's like swallowing up and then has he figured out how to fix it? Caitlin McShea (30m 32s):I can't imagine a better signal to science fiction. And so I'm just going to take that and run with it. I appreciate that there is this possibility for what did you call it, a logical invasion and how one might approach it as a, as a post visitation civilian earth. Michael and I were talking about this earlier in terms of the alien crash site question, which of course takes its premise. It's a page out of the roadside picnic novel by The Strugatsky Brothers as beautifully adapted by Tarkovsky, Michael and I were talking about how convenient it would have been if the triple parental civilization had made it to earth so that we could say that this was an object that you were like plucking from them. But I don't actually think that that would work in retrospect because I'm not sure that they would be so remarkably more sophisticated than us. They seem very similar to us. Caitlin McShea (31m 13s):Right. So, okay, scratch that some much more markedly, sophisticated alien civilization stopped for a bathroom break, decided to clean out the car before exiting and entering onto a much more interesting path to some other better destination. But when they landed, they dropped all this junk off. You happened to stumble upon one of these zones and knowing that something inside of it might change the course of human civilization at the risk of great personal injury, imprisonment, and even death. Tamara, what object would you like to uncover from the zone and why? Tamara van der Does (31m 45s):Alien drugs. Michael Garfield (31m 50s):Would they work? Tamara van der Does (31m 54s):Well, that's the thing. So also I just read Anthem. And so they're also the multiple worlds coming together, but the food doesn't transfer because at one point I was thinking that alien food would be great to taste and to see how it would be. Caitlin McShea (32m 11s):Right. But you can't presume that like you have the metabolic capacity to manifest energy from whatever this material is. Tamara van der Does (32m 17s):No, like exactly or how to understand alien art or so I, I went with, I actually put some thought into it, more thinking about Stalker and about roadside picnic, which in preparation I read and I was like, yeah, and looked at the list of artifacts. I was like, Oh, okay. And, but I, a little bit inspired. I actually still, but there's like a group of people in this book who the whole theory is that no idea is new. And so they spend their whole life just reading about all theories already done in the world, just to be able to say, no, this is not a new theory, obviously, because I know it all. Tamara van der Does (32m 58s):And there's an interesting question there of like, it will take your whole life to know all of these theories, which seems impossible. Also would knowing all these theories would lead you to have less imagination, less creativity. But at the same time, like when I was coming to the podcast, I was like, it would be nice if I could just remember everything I have ever read and everything I've ever studied. So I could answer smartly are these questions by these two excellent podcast stares. So I was like, I want a memory hat, a memory hat. This is what will be in this adding crash site where, and you can choose when you put it on or off, but you have access to all your memories. Michael Garfield (33m 36s):That's interesting. I wonder again how that kind of technology would even exist given that the entire history of human information technologies, several SFI people just last year put out that piece on information architecture and, and human civilization over time. We'll link to it in the show notes, but it seems like it's all about offloading memory to the environment. And so how would the path of technological development even result in something that could meaningfully restore a kind of identic memory to people given that it seems like the economies of scale of living more and more complex civilizations require us to actually shrink our brains. Tamara van der Does (34m 18s):Yeah. But yeah, the brain is so good at bringing up related topics, whereas your phone, it's not as fast, it's not as good. And maybe we need to try parental planet to have the brain capacity to take it down. But I don't know. I think it would just be nice to have a hat, but also to take it off, you don't want all these memories, but maybe sometimes you want access to all, to choose, to choose the chosen.  Caitlin McSheaAnd so you're suggesting that the wearer of this hat can very quickly and easily navigate through the network of these ideas. So it's infinite memory of everything experience. Yes. But immediately navigable, I'm going to go one step further. It's probably not a hat, but you found it in the zone and you're human. And so you're like, ah, and you put it on, but it could be a habitat for a much smaller alien, which would address this scaling problem to some degree.  Tamara van der Does (34m 59s): Right. I was kind of imagining a bucket hat, but I think just because why not new radical style, but I think, yes, who knows? I mean, who knows what was living in there or how it's affecting our brain to make that possible? I mean, some kind of weird alien technology that was probably made for something completely different that just interacts with our brains as such that there you go. Michael Garfield (35m 31s):It wasn't even the original intention, right. To pull another thread, Michael Crichton's novel Sphere, Caitlin and I talked about this, how much it has in resonance with alien crash site scientists discover this object inside a crash spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean. And it's having strange effects on the researchers. They're trying to figure out what it was actually intended for. And there's this whole conversation about, well, say a bacterium finds its way into the fuel cell of a human satellite and is poisoned by that fuel cell and comes to the conclusion that this was a weapon to use against bacteria when in fact that it was never even considered by human beings. Caitlin McShea (36m 11s):Well, that's the mystery, right? And this is the risk that's associated with the zone. This is why there's a whole Institute of extra terrestrial culture dedicated to trying to understand whatever the heck gets pulled out of the zone. But really it's just us using our human brains to retrofit these very sophisticated technologies to address probably much less sophisticated problems like your memory had is almost like a personal internet hat. Right? Which I would love, I would absolutely love that. But if at any, if aliens passed by on their way home, and so I was utilizing this object and that way they'd be like, that's disappointing. I'm glad we didn't really stop there.  Michael Garfield (36m 51s):So to link this back into work that you're doing right now. You mentioned this, that you have a preprint out already integrating social and cognitive aspects of belief dynamics towards a unifying framework. And it seems like this question of figuring out the correlation causation thing, right? Pulling apart a originally dimensional phenomenon and teasing apart the relationships between its various components and understanding how they are actually acting on one another and having to keep ourselves in check about our assumptions about the way that those things relate. You know, there's a, there's a kind of a similar question about like, okay, what does this hat do to the actual proportion or character of the contributions of an individual disposition and a social environment in this respect? Michael Garfield (37m 40s):Am I making any sense here? But I mean, so it's like, how do you go about in a way, you know, if you're, if you're trying to, to write a review in which you outline a unifying framework, bringing different belief, dynamical models into harmony with one another, you're talking about statistical physics, cognitive science, social theory. In some sense, these are communities that are alien to one another. And so the issue of translation becomes key here and of being able to verify accurate translation between these different domains. And so like, how has that actually done in your work as a scientist? How do you ground that in rigor? Tamara Van Der Does (38m 22s):You put the magical bucket hat that gives you knowledge of also, I think first you have to, I think accept that you cannot bring it all together. Some of us have an instinct of like, let's really bring in every single thing, discuss related to this topic into one mega framework and all will fit. The thing is not all well fit. I think people are approaching it in such different ways that sometimes you cannot summarize it all. Or maybe once we will be able to, then we can predict all human humanities futures socially. But I mean really here, the it's really just having a team of people who really know about different things. I mean, there's no way around it. And so I think as long as you and the team we worked with this, Dan Stein was part of it who he's a physicist, I guess I represent sociology then a psychology cognitive scientist. Tamara van der Does (39m 19s):So it was, it was quite actually easy for all of us to represent our fields as best as possible and put them in conversation with each other. I think when you do reviews, it's not as hard as when you actually try to do a more empirical paper, because then you run into bigger issues of like what constitute a valid argument, what constitute a valid proof? What does even, we had debates on like, what does mechanism or prediction mean? Which really varies across fields. And that's when things get quite difficult. Caitlin McShea (39m 56s):That was exactly my question, but now you don't have to answer it. I wondered if, either in the work that you do or in 72 hours, you came upon some total misunderstandings that were absolutely semantic in nature because I've been encountering that over and over. And it's an artifact of what a meaning. Like it's, it's like a distillation of a meaning in the word, but if the word is approached from a variety of different angles and then use in conversation between two people who are not sharing the foundation yeah. Are you progressing at all? It would seem like you're not, but you guys managed. Tamara van der Does (40m 25s):Yeah. It's very hard. And I think it's those words also that seem to have such an important role for humans yet are so hard to define and so causes, you know, the number one and then, but also yeah. Predict or mechanism or explain. And you're like, Oh, these are all words that we use all the time though. We all have an idea, but then scientifically it seems like it really means different things to different fields. And so, yeah. So do you say this caused this, this explains this, and we show a mechanism between this so we can predict, and everybody has different views, but I think once you realize that it's really just about lack of definitions for vague terms. Tamara van der Does (41m 9s):I think you can still move past that and have some kind of good. Oh yeah, for sure. I've witnessed it. They did a good work that comes out of it, but yeah.  Michael GarfieldSo what's next?  Tamara Van Der DoesWhat's next? Well with my infinite memory, Oh, write a book. Well, one next is really looking as I, as I mentioned, I have a few project looking at these large texts and looking how categories are defined with them, them and used. And I think that's the big next project. And I'm going to start small, just looking really, just describe what is happening in this context. Tamara van der Does (41m 53s):But I would really like to have some kind of better way to model how people with different agency or different goals, try to push these categories to be different over time and how do they find an equilibrium? And so with Vicky and Henrik, it was really much a model that was simulated at a very individual level, but kind of more culturally how with individuals, with agencies and goals, how do you model that? Caitlin McShea (42m 21s):But I have a more broad question for Tamara about like her work in discipline with other like, so just allow me completely unrelated, but something I meant to ask earlier. Something that I really like as someone who's outside of science is a narrative, a proposal of what's at stake in scientific research and understanding things in a more qualitative sense than a quantitative sense. I find that I can get the theory in broad strokes and I get very confused once the actual, like physical laws and mathematics are introduced just because that's the type of person that I am, but they seem to me somewhat entangled Yet I know that the type of work that you're doing is what one might call it, qualitative data collection, which I think is maybe even for me more capacious and it's expression. Caitlin McShea (43m 3s):Does that make sense? My question, like, have you found any like criticism as a social scientist collecting "qualitative" data in your research, or do you find that it's more capable of expressing like a much more complete rounded piece of data? Tamara van der Does (43m 20s):Yeah, I think that's where kind of my background comes into play is that there's such a strong, such a strong history, I think in sociology, in qualitative research. And there's actually a very strong belief in sociology that the best theories, which there is verbal theories that they mean the best theories come out only of qualitative research and that you cannot actually find anything new about humans by just doing a quantitative stuff. And I think it's a mix of the two. And I will also say that I'm not sure what I am doing to qualitative researcher is not qualitative, but it's a new area, which is a bit exciting, which people call computational social science. Tamara van der Does (44m 2s):I think there's something interesting now is that for the longest time, the only people who would analyze books and who would analyze news article were qualitative researchers and they would read it all in like manually code and deeply understand the text and analyze it that way. And now we have these methods that really enable an analysis of like a huge corporate. And so now you're bringing together, there's a very qualitative history of research together, this computer science methods and, you know, machine learning methods, mostly in trying to do science out of it. And it's still very clunky. I think a lot of people are trying to figure out how can we actually test different models that came out of qualitative research with this? Tamara van der Does (44m 49s):And is it meaningful? Is any of this, what we find, you know, it's topic modeling anything actually real, or just kind of correlations thrown out and then you interpret it, however the hell you want. And so I think that's very exciting. I think it was very exciting to be able, and for me, very excited for a person who actually did not want to manually code books or like spend a year with a group of people observing forever. That actually likes being in front of my computer is very exciting. Then now I can actually do in a way more in depth work, looking at how culture is created. Really. Caitlin McShea (45m 25s):Yeah. It seems a really effective tool towards navigating this very rich field of qualitative information. Now that you've explained it, it sounds a lot like your hat. It seems like, it seems like the manual coding of everything that one has encountered over a history of like pre computational social science is like the foundations of the hat. And then the computational level almost allows one to navigate it effectively for future work. So that's good. Tamara van der Does (45m 53s):We're all working towards creating this hat. Michael Garfield (45m 58s):And I guess that would be the summer's foundations and applications of humanities analytics program at SFI that you'd like the digital humanities that we're we're, we're, we're going to build a hat. Caitlin McShea (46m 11s):We'll let David Kenny, now that they're actually, they're due to construct this alien crash site hat. Tamara van der Does (46m 17s):That makes sense. Does that relate to your earlier question, Michael? Now I'm kind of seeing more of a connection and I'm like, Oh, maybe this was what you were hinting at beforehand. Yeah. I think is creating the hat thing is definitely creating the hat for analysis. Why not? And I mean, the opportunity is for...One thing I would like to like is also just organizational level stuff. And so how do different organization working like politically involved organizations write about how, you know the, about sections in the website, how do they identify themselves and all like, we are fighting for the rights of this group and this group in this group, but we're all unified because of this. Tamara van der Does (47m 0s):So, you know, you can think of differently immigrant organizations that try to bring different groups from different national origins together to fight for a common goal or even some like LGTBQA organization that try to bring really a very different group of people are together for a common goal. And so how do these kinds of missile level places create this idea is of identities of who's in who's out for again with a certain agency for change politics, change the world.  Michael Garfield (47m 30s):Tamara, that was really fun. Thanks for joining us both on our shows. Tamara van der Does (47m 37s):That's great. Yeah. Yes. Very courageous. The first one, Joan I'm honored. I'm honored. I was very nervous because both of you are like, I mean, I know that's why also the hat. I was like, man, Michael Garfield and Caitlin they're so cultured the know so much about everything. I wish I just had a hat, so it could be at their level.  Caitlin McSheaAlso, you know, that I judged harshly fashion. So it would have to be some sort of an artifact that can be worn.  Tamara Van Der DoesI, I think food, I mean alien drugs. I mean that if they could affect us, you could sell for like a lot of money probably. Michael Garfield (48m 16s):Yeah. There's actually a whole strain in that in dark horse comics, adaptation of the alien movies and Kegers alien where it turns out that the jelly produced by the Korean alien is this deeply addictive psychoactive chemical that creates like a kind of religious epiphany and superhuman performance abilities in human beings. And so it becomes like the hottest black market thing and it ends up having a more devastating effect on human society then there's this, you know, morphs themselves. We managed to keep them out of our world to some extent, but the chemicals that they secrete end up transforming human society, Tamara van der Does (48m 55s):We're always essentially undoing ourselves. Right? Michael Garfield (48m 59s):Anyway, indeed we are. And so we may not have come to it like, like the three body problem would have suggested. We may not have come to any solutions during this, but we definitely traced an interesting and kind of somewhat erratic path around the, the attractor. Tamara van der Does (49m 13s):Very, I like that. I like that. Well, thank you Caitlin for having me and thank you, Michael, for having me. Michael Garfield (49m 23s):Thanks to you both together. We have managed to contribute our intellectual DNA to a rather charming monster of an episode here. Tamara van der Does (49m 32s):Yes, exactly.

Thanks and enjoy! David Stork (0s):I look at Vanitas painting by Hendrik Van Steenwijk where you just have these objects on the table. And, you know, there's a skull and their books and there's an oil lamp and so forth. But everyone in the Dutch golden age who would have seen that painting really wouldn't be so interested in the objects and the surface level of what's being depicted. But instead the message, the moral, the message of Vanitas. Do not concern yourself with the pleasures and diversions of this life here, but instead prepare yourself lead a sober life for the eternal life to come. David Stork (41s):And there are many ways in which a painting can convey that message. And AI is barely touching that class of problems. Michael Garfield (1m 17s):Art History is a lot like archeology. We here in the present day get artifacts and records, but the gaps between them are enormous. And the questions that they beg loom large. Historians need to be able to investigate and interpret to unpack the meanings and the methods of a given work of art. But even for the best, the act of reconstruction is a trying test. Can we program computers to decipher the backstory of a painting, analyzing light and shadow to guess at how a piece was made and even more ambitiously can AI learn to see and tell the story is rendered in an images, symbolic content. Recent innovations, yield, surprising insights, and suggest a cyborg future for art scholarship in which we teach machines to not just recognize a set of objects, but to grok their context and relationships shining light on messages and narratives. Michael Garfield (2m 14s):One's lost to time and deepening our study of the world of signs. Welcome to complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us. Far-ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week we speak with David G. Stork who has held full-time and visiting faculty positions in physics, mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, statistics, neuroscience, psychology, and art and art history variously at Wellesley and Swarthmore colleges, as well as holding corporate positions as chief scientist at Rico Innovations and fellow at Rambus, Inc. Michael Garfield (3m 2s):We talk about what happens when computers look at art and the implications for art history and connoisseurship.

It's a pleasure to have you on complexity podcast. David Stork (3m 33s):It's a great pleasure to be here. Michael Garfield (3m 36s):This is a very interesting topic, and I would like to start on the ground. Let's talk about your background because you started as a physics major.  David Stork (3m 50s):Sure. How did I come to start using computers to analyze paintings? Michael Garfield (3m 53s):Yeah. Like why was this an interest to you? What set you off on this path? David Stork (3m 58s):I come from a family steeped in the arts. My great-grandfather was court painter to crown Prince Rudolph, Joe Franz Josef, rather in Austria and his paintings hang in, museums in Austria and elsewhere. I won't go through all the arts folk in my family except to go down to my younger sister, Kathleen, who was chief calligrapher in the White House under Bill Clinton. So I was raised steeped in the arts and early on though, I got very interested in science, but didn't see much of a connection between the two and my science pure science career was doing very well. David Stork (4m 37s):But while a graduate student, I wrote a book and then later taught some courses on optics and perception and vision and so forth. And the connection and the application to art was really fascinating to me and very fascinating to the students. So I had that sort of background. At MIT I was indeed a physics major, but my senior thesis under Edwin Land, the founder of the Polaroid corporation was on human visual perception in Mondrian images, things that involve color perception and things like this. And then in my PhD, I worked on human visual perception, very mathematical and technical and solving wave equations in the retina and things like this. David Stork (5m 22s):But the connection to the visual arts had always sort of been in the background. I grew up in Chevy, chase outside Washington DC, and hence had great access to the national gallery and all the great museums in Washington. And frankly, you know, those docent tours when you're had a museum and some docent is leading around 10 people in 0.1 of those absolutely changed my life. I don't know if that woman is still alive, but American art at mid century on an American abstract expressionism, Jackson Pollack, and Mark Rothko and Arshile Gorky and so on. David Stork (6m 6s):And I saw so much more, there was so much going on in these artworks that I had no idea what's going on before then. And so while at MIT, I cross registered for art history courses at Wellesley College, which was a very, very good art history department. And I got a sense of the depth, the subtlety, the problems that arise in art history. And I just got fascinated and to skip over a few decades. At the year 2001, I was invited to a big conference in New York to analyze artists. David Hockney's very controversial theory that Renaissance painters secretly used optical devices during the execution of their works. Spoiler alert. David Stork (6m 54s):They did not certainly not that early, but my work involved a lot of technical analysis of perspective and lighting and contours and things like this. And they really showed that computers can outperform even human experts in some very restricted classes of problems. And I got very, very interested in this and bit by bit I worked with more and more conservators and curators and art historians and so forth at major museums and things like this. And I started developing these techniques and taught the first courses on that at Stanford. David Stork (7m 34s):And I've lectured all around the world and now it's really blossomed and I'm working now at 700 as of this morning, 731 pages on my book on the subject. So that's how I got here. Michael Garfield (7m 49s):So when you spoke at SFI earlier this week, I was taken by the way that your approach to reconstructing the methodologies used by painters looks like kind of a crime scene investigation. You're trying to figure out, like you said, what, what were the tools, what were the weapons? How did they build the pyramids? It's it's, it's, it's a form of archeology kind of. David Stork (8m 14s):Oh yeah. Art scholarship, art history. At SFI I only had a chance to talk about one small portion of my total work, which is involved with what kind of lighting did they use? Was it consistent? How can we use this, these lighting analysis tools to identify the, as we say, hands, the number of artists who work on the given, given work, we're looking at perspective for perspective and consistencies and things like this, but I've also worked on authentication, including works like Jackson Pollock by image. Now a full authentication protocol involves looking at pigments, what pigments were available, what pigments were used, the support, carbon dating and a whole host of things. David Stork (8m 59s):My research focuses on what you can do with the image. What does a connoisseur do when he, or she analyzes a painting or drawing? And those are the kinds of techniques that I'm trying to embody and implement in algorithms. Michael Garfield (9m 18s):So I'd like to invite you to talk a little bit about the work that you've done with Vermeer, Girl with a Pearl Earring. This question of, we look at a painting and you said, did they actually use a living subject? Were they looking at something and painting from life or where they painting from the imagination. David Stork (9m 40s):Or we use optical tools  Vermeer is one of the most wonderful artists, but he also brings together some of the highest technical questions you ever get. In fact, your audience can't see it, but I'm holding up to you. This issue of heritage science, the girl in the spotlight, the technical re-examination of Ramirez girl, the Prolia, it's an entire small book, just on the technical analysis of pigments and paintings and the glazing techniques and the supports and things like this. You could spend a lifetime just on Vermeer. So yes, what I spoke about at SFI was lighting analysis. So we use model dependent and model independent methods. Model independent methods are where you don't need to make any assumptions about the three dimensional form in this case of her face. Model dependent ones you do. David Stork (10m 33s):So we looked at cast shadows, the reflections off her eye off the Pearl. One of the most powerful techniques, which actually comes from forensic photography is called the occluding contour algorithm, which is looking at the pattern of light on the outside of an object that's being illuminated and inferring from that pattern of lightness where the light must be coming from. And the question of where was the light in Vermeer studio, actually, that alone isn't very interesting But what is interesting and what we showed really definitively is the astounding agreement, the astounding commensurateness of the estimates from all these different sources. David Stork (11m 22s):So that shows certainly that there was a girl present in his studio in Delft when he made this, but it also shows how accurate he was. And there were several other artists like Georges de Latour that we've worked on, whose nocturnes, these dark nighttime scenes are renowned for their portrayal of lighting throughout the scene. We show in ways that no connoisseurs, I frankly can really elucidate the consistencies and the inconsistencies in the other artworks through these computer techniques. And it turns out humans actually are not very good at inferring lighting, seeing lighting differences. David Stork (12m 8s):In other talks, I show a picture of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, which were on the cover of, I think it was the Star Magazine. Anyway, that was photo-shopped, we'd say tampered. And the way you can determine that is by this occluding contour algorithm, looking at the side of Brad's face and Angelina's face and inferring that the lighting is very, very different, but those fakes get into the popular discourse very easily, because we are so bad at noticing these areas, but the computer techniques are absolutely superb. And so these have many applications throughout art scholarship, and that's, that's the kind of thing I'm working on. Michael Garfield (12m 51s):So can you talk a little bit about how you build light field models and then how you use that to analyze paintings where you have a question about whether this was a painting that was done all at once or whether this was a painting where... David Stork (13m 9s):Background was painted and then the subject was painted later. Sure. Michael Garfield (13m 13s):Right. You can identify the painter was actually like walking around, trying to recreate a light source. David Stork (13m 20s):Sort of. We applied our techniques to a contemporary painter, Garth Herrick, who lives in Philadelphia, whom I've learned about when I was a beginning assistant professor at Swarthmore College many years ago. And he works from photographs. He does a lot of official portraits of senators and congressmen and mayors and such like and so forth. And it's difficult to get famous people to stand in your studio for weeks on end. So he goes out and takes a photograph of the figure, but he wants this figure to be in front of a certain background. David Stork (14m 1s):And that might not be generally, it's not his office. So he goes somewhere else and takes another photograph, goes back into his studio and is now painting using two, we call them reference, two photographs. And when he's painting the background, he looks at one photograph. And when he's painting the figure he paid, he looks at the other photograph. There is no guarantee that the lighting in those two photographs is commensurate from the same direction, the same distribution and so forth, or that he can detect that as I've just mentioned and then fix or make it commensurate. So we've looked at several of his paintings and ask the question, can the computer tell that the lighting in the background is different from that on the figure? David Stork (14m 48s):And the answer is yes. And in certain cases, and this works even in complex, we call them light fields, the pattern of light coming from many different directions. So like coming through a window from a candle reflected off the floor, whatever it might be, it can be arbitrarily complex. And that occluding contour algorithm I mentioned can be generalized to infer, not just the primary direction the light's coming, but instead the entire light field. We describe it with five numbers using a spherical basis, function, set the mathematical details I didn't go into, but basically it's a way of saying, ah, the lights has this pattern on this figure, but this other pattern on someone else and thereby tell whether they were done under the same studio conditions and so forth. David Stork (15m 43s):And so for Garth's paintings, we did human on my faithless arm, which he painted in two episodes or campaigns we call them, the painted the background. And then nine months later, he moved to a different, he had moved to a different studio, different time of year, different position of the window. He was painting in a mirror. And so his self portrait had somewhat different light field on him than the background. And it's difficult to see by eye. I've shown, not just the digital image, but the actual painting in my aunt to art scholars. And it's hard. You really can't tell, but the computer finds it immediately and definitively. David Stork (16m 27s):So that's how we use lighting analysis for that kind of question. Michael Garfield (16m 31s):Yeah. There's the, the cast shadow analysis also. David Stork (16m 34s):Yeah. The cast shadow is one of the simplest. You actually don't need computers to do the basics of cache shadow analysis. You just take a point on an occluder, like the tip of girl, the Prolia earrings nose and its corresponding cash shadow point draw a straight line. But if you have many cast shadows and you want to infer the most likely position of a light source for all that cash shadow evidence, you use technique called maximum likelihood estimation. It's a standard statistical technique, but applied in a special way for two dimensional artworks to say, ah, given all this lighting information over Georges de Latour's Christ in the Carpenter's Studio. David Stork (17m 18s):For instance, the most likely positioned for the illuminant is here and not here. We did that analysis in order to test David Hockney's claim that that painting was done with the light shorts quote outside the frame of the picture. It absolutely positively bet your life on it was not. Michael Garfield (17m 40s):So, as you alluded to earlier, there's this, this other dimension, which is the use of tools, of mirrors, lenses, projection techniques. You give an example of the Van Eyck Arnolfini painting. Oh yes. And in your talk, you presented a rather thorough run through of how you actually like recreated the entire crime scene of this thing.David Stork (18m 12s):It's not a crime. It is the most sublime and important paintings of the Western Canon first double full length, double portrait in the West. When the earliest portraits in oil paint, the first painting in the West to show an action, something occurring inside a domicile, inside a home. No this painting, it's not a crime. It's, it's, it's a masterpiece, Michael Garfield (18m 35s):But it is. I mean, I guess, you know, historically artists were not really incented to show their work, right? And so the point is that it's a crime that we don't know how it was done.  David Stork (18m 47s):Yes, it's true. Some artists had secret techniques for especially mixing pigments that they would keep secret, but often they would announce that they had secrets. I've got a secret method like the Venetian glass workers or the prototypical example, the ways in which they heated sand and so forth and made their glassware was a big secret. And there were penalties for revealing these secrets, but they were announced as secrets. But the question about whether certain artists used optical aids is really, really quite fascinating. David Stork (19m 28s):And first of all, we know some did, Canaletto and Thomas Akins, the great realist painter from the Philadelphia area. But I find it really frustrating when you start hearing this, the first thing that the scholars or casual folk want to talk about is whether it's cheating or not. I find that so profoundly, intellectually lazy. The real question is first, did they do it? Yes or no. And after that, it's fine to talk about what it means, whether it would have been cheating, how it affects the transition of art and the development of art and so forth. David Stork (20m 10s):And so we've gone through, we've spent several years on, I don't know, maybe 20 papers by now on different aspects of this in order to answer these questions. And I think we've done it. And the scholarly community is now I think universally on the side that someone like beyond what Jan Eyck did not use any optical aids directly during the execution of his works. There's a modified fall back position. Well maybe he saw an optical image and that indirectly influenced him. I don't know how you test that. We have no documentary. There's so many other sources for this rise in the realism of art around the time of Van Eyck, including the invention of oil paints. David Stork (20m 59s):That it's very hard to address that modified version. But the direct case I think is completely solved. Michael Garfield (21m 8s):And part of solving this was you took a detour into the mirror that appears in this painting. David Stork (21m 16s):Well, absolutely. Yes. The convex mirror at the center of the Arnel Feeney masterpieces, most scholars would claim the most famous mirror depicted in all of art. It's right at the center. It shows the back of Arnel Feeney and his wife and the two witnesses to the wedding coming through the doorway. It has metaphorical significance because it's convicts bowing out. And so it gives a wide angle omniscient view of the entire Tableau as if God is watching. And, Oh gosh, I could talk for hours on this. But I mean, one of the most famous paintings, one of the greatest paintings is Las Meninas by Diego Velazquez and the Arnel Feeney portrait hung in the Alcazar palace in Madrid. David Stork (22m 2s):And so he certainly saw it and that influenced Valasquez to put in a plain mirror in the middle of the Las Meninas. But the question we address, the technical question we addressed was answering the explicit claim of David Hockney and his scientific colleague, Charles Falco, that, that convex me or turned around to be a concave mirror, could have been used during the execution of the work of the painting itself. And there are a dozen reasons why that cannot be true. One is these mirrors were not perfectly circular. They were blown glass and would have imperfections. David Stork (22m 43s):So even if everything else were perfect, the image that gets projected we've shown through computer ray tracing would have been far too blurry. Second of all, those convex mirrors were coated with metals to be reflective like mirrors, but then coated with tar. So it's to seal it in. So there would be no reflection whatsoever. And what I showed in my SFI talk was that the focal length would have been far, far, far too short to comport with the geometry in the actual painting. And there are other rebuttals, but, but those are the main ones. So the technique we use, we've actually done it three different ways. David Stork (23m 23s):The first came from Antonio Criminisi in Cambridge, England, but done to others, which is basically modeled the reflection off of a convex sphere and undo the mathematics. If you will find what radius of curvature, what bulginess of the mirror, comports with the image that we see reflected in that painting. And that gives us the radius of curvature. And it turns out the focal length of such a mirror would be one half that radius of curvature. And it cannot comport with the geometry in the painting as a whole. David Stork (24m 4s):And this is a real technical detail. Maybe it's too much for your audience, but you might say, Oh, well maybe Van Eyck did a piecemeal patchwork projection. He projected this part or the window, and then trace that then moved over and did some... That can't explain the evidence either because there are all these nice, long, straight lines on the floor, on the window sill, along the back wall, the ceiling, the bed, and so forth, which would have curvatures and breaks as well, if you did that. So, no. Michael Garfield (24m 42s):Yeah. So one of the questions that this seems to be answering is specifically the reconstruction of the timeline of the innovation of painting technology. David Stork (24m 50s):Yeah, that's a very, very important question. Surely technology has influenced the development of art in many ways. I mean, photography alone, that the, you get the snapshot framing in paintings in France after the invention of photography and a whole host of things. One of my favorites here at Stanford, I can almost see it from my window here is the very famous Eadweard Muybridge sequence of the running horse. The, the famous debate from Governor Stanford, whether all four legs of a horse left the ground simultaneously and paintings before then let's see Jerome and several others show them with the, the, the front legs forward and the back legs, backward flying off the ground. David Stork (25m 43s):And everyone thought those look very natural and dynamic. And yeah, he's got that right. After the Muybridge movie, proto movie, showing that yes, all legs are off simultaneously, but it's when the legs are underneath the belly of the horse together, the front legs are back. The back legs are forward. Once you see that the previous versions practically look silly. And so that's just one of hundreds of ways in which technology has changed how we see and thus how artists create. Michael Garfield (26m 25s):So I, that seems like a good place to peg into the other half of this, which is about semiotics and, and, and meaning and training machines to actually interpret art the way that a human art kind of sewer can interpret art. You have a piece on this computational identification of significant actors in paintings through symbols and attributes. And I just want to say it really is. It's a steep learning curve, but to get into this kind of appreciation, because especially in the Western Canon, it's like, it's just hundreds of white guys with beards, right. Michael Garfield (27m 11s):And so how do you tell them apart? And you know, it's not like we're operating from a photograph. It's a canonized figure, but there isn't a bedrock of empirical GroundTruth face to work from. So what are the problems for machine vision created by this that are not present? You know, when you've got Google photos trying to do facial recognition? David Stork (27m 36s):Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, that brings up the broader question of what problems does art pose that traditional AI is not addressing. And this is one of them,. To me, the most important, and frankly, it was sort of an epiphany. I can go back to that, but most photographs are taken to document something. Here I am on the beach. Here's the bowl of spaghetti in front of me, look at this, everybody, Oh, isn't my dog cute. And things like this. Art really goes speaking in the broadest of terms. There's a great deal of art that was created in order to convey a story, a moral or a message and have a meaning that the artist has an intent. David Stork (28m 24s):He or she is trying to instruct you in some way or inform you. And most of in the history of Western art, most of that has come from religious art. These are stories from the Bible. These are morals. This is Adam and Eve, you know, Abraham and Isaac and, you know, descent from the cross and things like this. All of these are screaming with meaning. And as you will recall, from my SFI talk, I look at Vanitas painting by Hendrik Van Steenwijk where you just have these objects on the table. And you know, there's a skull and their books and there's a oil lamp and so forth. David Stork (29m 4s):But everyone in the Dutch golden age who would have seen that painting really wouldn't be so interested in the objects, the surface level of what's being depicted. But instead the message, the moral, the message of Vaniitas.  Do not concern yourself with the pleasures and diversions of this life here, but instead prepare yourself lead a sober life for the eternal life to come. And there are many ways in which a painting can convey that message. And AI is barely touching that class of problems, but there's a whole branch of computer vision called semantic image analysis, but semantic for them means, Oh, there's a person on a man on a horse, a woman walking beside and a tree in the background and a river . David Stork (29m 59s):To them that's semantic understanding the meaning to me, that's nowhere near what is going on in the visual arts, which is one step further. You're really getting to the intention of the artist. We call them authors in this case, whereas input photography, you don't. And so this is the classic problems that I'm working on with colleagues in Cambridge University, in England and elsewhere around the world. And the paper you're referring to was just a first stab at that. If you take for Akio's a baptism of Christ, very famous painting in the Fitzy gallery in Florence. It shows Christ standing in the middle Saint John the Baptist pouring water over his head. David Stork (30m 47s):But how is it that the audience recognizes who these people are as a step towards understanding the meaning of Christ, you know, is washing your sin, taking your sins and so forth. And in religious art, we have something that's really very interesting to me. I called attributes for those of us who work in pattern classification. We have a different word for apt use for the word attribute, but in religious iconography, an attribute is something that an object that indicates the identity of someone. So Saint Catherine is a wheel because she was martyred on a wheel. David Stork (31m 31s):Christ might have a cross or a lamb. St. John the Baptist has a cross, and there are literally thousands of saints. And some of them have very unusual attributes, including one I had to look it up. Silk gloves. There's a Saint whose attribute is silk gloves. Anyway, the religious authorities, especially in the, you know, Renaissance and later would include these as patrons would have the artists portray these in order to instruct the illiterate parishioners so that, you know, an illiterate person in a cathedral in France would look at this and say, aha, I see that cross or the shell or whatever it might be. David Stork (32m 20s):And know, not only the actor, the, the Saint, but also the story. And so that's the kind of mental process that goes on in an art scholars and general public's literate general public's mind. And we said, can we do this with the computer, with algorithms? And the answer is yes. In our preliminary studies, basically we have two. They're called deep neural networks. They are AI techniques for doing pattern classification and other things. And one of them is for what's called semantic segmentation, breaking the image so that you can identify where there are people and where there are not people. David Stork (33m 4s):And so applied to that, Verrochio painting. You would get the two main figures in the Tableau. But then we had another deep network that was trained using art images to recognize those attributes. In this case, the dove over Christ and the crucifixion cross in the hands of St. John. And then it's a very simple geometric problem to say, all right, for each identified attribute, which figure is closest, very trivial, and assign that look up in your database, ah, this attribute means this Saint or, or actor. David Stork (33m 45s):And so indeed the computer can say, ah, this is Christ in the middle. And this is St. John. And we've done it on a number of paintings. And we're expanding that technique. Now at one level, it's easy. I mean, if you show this to an art scholar, they say, Oh, obviously, you know, you can tell that's Christ, what's the problem. This is one of the banes of those of us working in pattern classification. We worked for decades to recognize a hand or a face or something like this that a child can do. But to me, this is one of the first steps towards this entire class of problems that AI really isn't addressing. David Stork (34m 28s):And that is inferring the meanings, the intention of the artist. So there's a lot of work to be done on this, but that paper that we published just last last month was exactly on, on this. And we're working, working hard on pushing it forward. Michael Garfield (34m 46s):Yeah. It seems related to the issue of using the application of machine vision in robotics, because there's this question of you, you may be able to train a warehouse robot to recognize or a caregiving robot to recognize when someone has a hand, that's a hand, but the difference between a hand that's reaching out to hold tenderly or a hand, that's reaching out to strike an act of violence. That seems somewhat related to a complication that you, you mentioned in this paper that there's an additional layer of context and inference required because in spite of the fact that yes, everyone has their unique attributes. Michael Garfield (35m 33s):And we're not just talking about Christian artwork. You mentioned the Greek and Roman Pantheon. You mentioned the word, the Hindu artwork. This is very much a universal human phenomenon, David Stork (35m 46s):Not to interrupt, but, or to interrupt likewise telling the professions of people. This person's holding a violin. I have an idea what he or she does, or a shovel and, and things like this. So yeah, it's much broader than Christian art. The reason we worked on Christian art is that there are a lot of examples, relatively large, small compared to the number of photographs that exists on the web, but in, in the art world, there's a lot of religious art and there's a very intentional and specific use of these attributes in order to basically convey a meaning. So that's why we chose that first, but it's a much broader class of problems. Michael Garfield (36m 30s):Yeah. So, so to that point, you know, with a violin, for example, someone holding a violin could be a violinist, but they could also be a luthierr. And as you mentioned, you say multiple saints share the same attributes. So for those cases, the attribute taken alone is not sufficient for accurate actor identification and a more probable probabilistic inference may be necessary based on a global criteria of all the actors and their simultaneous presence in candidate stories or episodes. So it seems as though what you're getting at is that it's about teaching computers how to read the room as it were the contextual clues. Michael Garfield (37m 12s):Melanie Mitchell gave a great talk on this about, say a self-driving car and counters someone walking a dog across the street, but you know, okay, you can say that's a human, that's a dog, but if you don't know the relationship between them, then you don't know how to respond. David Stork (37m 33s):Yup. There's a lot of sort of sub versions of this, this problem. But yeah, I mean, at one level, this is as we call it, AI complete that it takes full human level intelligence and cognition and memory and so forth to interpret. I mean, things like common sense that death is a bad thing. Where does it say that in the painting. Why is Christ had dipping down the side, such a bad thing? This is going to take a long time before we really get that kind of level of common sense. So as AI has progressed, it's it started on smaller problems that are relatively constrained, that nevertheless illustrate key classes of problem solving. David Stork (38m 19s):And that's what we're trying to do with art. But here's one thing that you, you do not get, this is one really fascinates me and you do not get in traditional AI. And that's the role of style as part of meaning, that if you take the same content to people standing by a riverside and you portray them in different styles, the meaning of the work will change. So for instance, in that Van Steenwijk, still life, the fact that all those objects were extraordinarily realistic, they worked extraordinarily hard. Someone like Peter Dubuque would spend days on a really small passage to get the textures right, the subtleties. Not only did that showcase their technical facility, but the goal was to say, this is real. This is right in front of these aren't saints, floating through sky with halos on their heads and clouds all around them. No, this is the world that is right in front of you. If you were to have that exact same content portrayed in a, an impression of style or pointless style or abstract style, the meaning would be certainly less than maybe even drained completely. And that to me is a really fast and artists, of course know this, they bring this aspect of style towards creating their meaning. David Stork (39m 47s):And just to give you one other example, Roy Lichtenstein is a very famous American pop artist. His paintings look like comic book images, and one of his most famous paintings is called brushstroke. And it's this just a, I think it's on a blue background, but it's a big yellow brush stroke made like a cartoon. So it's that it's in this cartoon style that makes it savagely critical of the previous art period, abstract expressionism, you know, Jackson Pollock and Joan Mitchell and the great abstract expressionists who made their gestures very visible and so forth. David Stork (40m 29s):And now in the moment, you know, in the instant and now Lichtenstein is going back and drawing it very carefully, making it in two colors, black outline yellow in the center, like a comic book. And it's that style. If he were to have the exact same thing in a realistic style, like a brush stroke, the meaning would have been entirely different. So this to me is an incredibly fascinating problem that art really far more than photographs conveys meaning from the lowest levels, the colors that you use, the brush strokes, that you've all the way up to the composition and so forth in ways that photographs really don't. David Stork (41m 12s):I don't mean to beat up on photographs, but to me, great, art just has the kind of levels of depth of analysis that even some of the best art photographs I don't think can match. I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of photographers sending me angry emails, but I'm going to stick actually.  Michael Garfield (41m 34s):Actually, no, you spoke directly to a question that some of the people following our coverage of your talk on Twitter had about this, which is the circumscribed utility of this kind of forensic reconstruction technique. When it comes to, you have to make certain assumptions about the intent of a realist painter, given the period and the school. And so on. When the reality, as you just said, is that even working from life, the painters will alter a scene for any of a number of reasons. And so where does sort of part one of this conversation break on part two. What's the solution for the metal layer at which it may look like you've managed to say conclusively, that the light reflections off of this object are wrong, therefore... David Stork (42m 34s):Yeah, no, this brings up the kind of early criticisms I got from the art community before they really knew what I was working on. And the kinds of techniques. If you have a very shallow understanding of my work, you say, Oh, Stork thinks that a painting is right if it's in perfect perspective and it's wrong, if it's not, absolutely not. I'm not saying that whatsoever. We are using these techniques to understand and quantify these aspects. And these are not normative judgments. The Arnel Feeney portrait is not wrong or bad or worse because it's not in proper perspective. David Stork (43m 14s):These were the techniques at the time, we have to understand the art in its context, but when there's a claim that the chandelier is in perfect perspective, that is an objective claim that regardless of the period, and as you saw in my talk, I also did some analysis of chandelier's painted in 2004 I think they were. So we have to be very aware of the context and the questions. And frankly, the part of my work that I'm really most proud of, or is not most obvious to those who, who see it is how much time I spend corresponding and talking and meeting with art scholars to understand questions that they have. David Stork (44m 4s):I'm not doing my work for computer scientists really. I mean the later stuff, I think we'll push AI in new directions and I'm eager with that, but it's much more important to get a good question that is relevant to the art community solved reasonably well then to solve a problem that's for the computer scientists and do it extremely well that the art community doesn't care about. If I've worked really hard and made a absolute superb edge detection algorithm that worked superbly on the Mona Lisa, there's not an art scholar in the world who would care and they shouldn't, it doesn't matter to them. I'd much rather identify a problem often with them, almost always with them that they say, ah, yes, if you can solve this, that will help us. David Stork (44m 53s):So here here's just one example. I gave my talk on Vermeer at the Maritz House Museum in the Hague where the Girl  With the Pearl Earring hangs and view of Delft. This is a superb small, it's a Mecca for those of us who love Vermeer. And then the chief conservator came up to me afterwards and said, I've got a problem for you. She took me back to the conservation studio and showed me paintings by Jan Van Der Heyden contemporary in the Dutch golden age of Vermeer, who did these city scapes that they're called Capri shows because he would put together buildings that weren't actually always next to each other. David Stork (45m 34s):He'd say, Oh, I'll put this building here or like that building there. And they used the technique for painting as bricks, thousands of teeny little bricks that look perfect that may have involved counter proofing, basically taking a metal plate, etching it in the pattern of the bricks and then printing it, pushing it against the paint to leave patterns. And if he did so maybe he would have done use the same plate on multiple paintings. You can't. And so the same exact same brick pattern would appear in different paintings. You can't detect that by eye. The amount of work of getting a painting in front of you. David Stork (46m 15s):And let me try, Oh, look over here. No, but this is perfect for computer search. You get a template basically of the patch and you, you check every other painting. And so we published a paper on that. I had known of Jan Van Der Heyden, but I didn't know about this question. It came 100% from the chief conservator at the Maoris house and we published two papers on it. And that's what I love doing. Michael Garfield (46m 42s):That's actually great. You led right into the next question that I had for you, which was about the fact that historically, you know, even realist, quote, unquote, realist painters, doing portraiture for clients we're often subtly or not so subtly incented to flatter their clients. Right. You know, we're going to cut a few inches off the waist and, you know, so you would imagine that light light field analysis would reveal, Oh, actually, you know, Henry the Eighth was probably 20 or 30 pounds heavier than he's depicted in this image. So you've got a similar kind of problem now. And I think people are thinking of this as a kind of qualitatively new problem, but your work reveals that there is a continuity here between that kind of question and that kind of approach to answering the question with deep fake forensics. Michael Garfield (47m 37s):And yeah, I mean, the fact is that we are perhaps now more than ever astoundingly vulnerable to what York University philosopher, Regina Rini called the epistemic backstop of recorded media, you know, that we believe a photograph and you know, so I'm, I'm curious what your thoughts are on applying these techniques, not just to art history, but to the present day and making sense of and figuring out what really, you know, it's sort of like a swallowing the spider to chase the fly kind of thing, right? It's a, it's a, it's an evolutionary arms race of counterfeiting against forensics. But how do you think that these tools can help us find the base truth of our lives in a world that's just increasingly spinning out of control? David Stork (48m 26s):Well, I have ambitions, but maybe that's, that's too large to, to restore Western culture to an epistemic unity that, that got lost once defects started flooding the internet. Let me step back and give you a class of problems where I'll call them semi forensic. I mean, my lighting analyses can tell whether there's great consistency in portrait lighting and other lighting, and a question that art historians address is centered on the portraits of Rembrandt. Of course, one of the greatest portraitists of all time. David Stork (49m 8s):We know he did many of his portraits from the figure. We know who these people were. We have the records of  how much they paid when, when they sat for him and so forth. So there's no question whatsoever that so-and-so was sitting in Vermeer's studio in Amsterdam, on such and such a date. There are other portraits often of saints and so forth where it's much less clear. We basically, we know that he did it from his imagination. He wanted someone with this kind of curly nose. Maybe he found someone on the street, but often didn't. And then there are examples where we really don't know art scholars debate. David Stork (49m 51s):What's this a real person in Amsterdam, or is it from his imagination? The research I'd love to do, and it would involve a lot of, a lot of work and getting the data. But I suspect that the lighting would be far more consistent on portraits done from the figure, and it would be much less consistent on orchards done from his imagination. And then when we had one of uncertain origin, we could do the lighting analysis and say, aha, look how consistent it is. It's as consistent as if there were a figure there. And therefore that would give at least a probabilistic suggestion that there was indeed a figure there or not. David Stork (50m 34s):Now I don't call those deep fakes. I mean, Rembrandt, wasn't trying to fool us. He wasn't hiding, you know, lying to us in any way, deceiving us by making a painting from his imagination. But these techniques may allow us to go that one level deeper, sort of like a deep fake, but deep fake has a epistemic overtone that Rembrandt portraits don't at least in my mind, Michael Garfield (51m 2s):Here's a somewhat smaller bite sized question, which you addressed. And you brought up towards the end in the Q and A of your talk that something on the order of $1 trillion in art worldwide is believed to be mis-attributed. David Stork (51m 20s):Well or fake. Yeah, no, the, the problem of fakes, I could talk for many hours on this. I mean, it's a profound and deep, deep problem. The number of fakes and misattributed works is really, really large. And it might be as high as 20% even on museum walls. Now that doesn't mean they're all fakes. They're just misattributed that our scholars make honest mistakes and so forth. I've heard quotes that in the commercial market, it might be as much as 40% are not authentic. It's, it's hard to say because there are all these forces making it difficult to find them out, to find those facts out. David Stork (52m 3s):The largest one, at least in my mind is that there's a legal doctrine called defamation of property. If you own a painting that you're telling everyone is by Van Gogh and it's worth a hundred million dollars. And I come out and say, no, I don't think it is. You consume me, even if I'm right and so forth, and you can completely ruin my life. I don't want to get into the legal sides, but the problems of authenticating art, it's really deep and profound. And the kind of image work we're doing, I think can help in certain examples. But it's only one small part of a full regiment. You have to do iconography, look for what are called anachronisms. David Stork (52m 46s):There was the terrorist museums debacle two or three years ago, a museum in the South of France, which had, I think it was about 140 paintings of which 82 were determined to be fake. But one of the reasons they could tell was that they were landscapes, that included buildings that were built after the artist's death. So, so a leader for German artists went out, tried to use the same style, but inserted a building. So that kind of technique also looking at material composition, iconography there, there are a whole host of very difficult, you know, complicated ones and image is just part of it. David Stork (53m 30s):It's true at the time of Bernard Berenson and the early connoisseurs, the I Reign Supreme and bit by bit scientific analysis and x-rays and infrared re reflectography and all these other techniques got brought to bear, but the technologies I'm working on only address the pure image analysis part. There is another level of analysis, which is how do you put together this information, how, when you have different sources of information each with different reliabilities, you know, when, when five scholars disagree, what do you do? David Stork (54m 9s):Well, what are in fact I'm writing right now is a paper on taking the techniques from medical diagnosis. There are now AI systems that take objective measurements like blood pressure or chemical compositions of your blood along with subjective or more subjective measures and puts those together in a way to get the best diagnosis and you learn from large corporate, large databases of medical data in order to do this. And I think the same kind of rigorous probabilistic inference can help in putting together the different sources of information all with uncertainties in attribution and authentication of art. Michael Garfield (54m 57s):So that may actually be an answer to the last question I had for you, which in keeping with the oddly religious tone of this entire conversation is what do you regard as the Holy Grail of this trajectory of the evolution of this technology? David Stork (55m 18s):Good question. There were a number of layers. I mean, in my lifetime, I, my goal is to get these computer techniques to be part of every art history school and techniques that, that, that, that art historians and curators, and connoisseurs will use these, these methods, the way computing has revolutionized every other field, basically biology, chemistry, and physics, and so forth that, that trying to do the vast amount of chemistry without computing it's, it's unthinkable now, but in the long run, long meaning once we get human level AI, I would love to see how we can take scholars, connoisseurs knowledge and capture it in some sort of algorithms so that complex, very complex system, so that we can then say, how would Bernard Berenson have responded to this painting that we just found? And the deep, deep, far, far distant blue sky dream is for such a system to come up with a novel, not just an interpretation of a deep artwork, but a novel one, one that captures our, our attention admiration and becomes part of the scholarship. But that is so far away. I'm reluctant. I'm almost loath to mention it because the art scholars in your audience are pitting the base of their palm against their head and their they've turned off the podcast already. David Stork (57m 3s):So very, very far away, very far away, Michael Garfield (57m 7s):30 years ago, compositional style transfer seems unfeasible to many people. And so maybe it's not so unbelievable that you might be able to model and resurrect art critics. David Stork (57m 19s):I agree, but a better example is chess. You know, when Alan Turing proposed chess as a test for artificial intelligence, it's not a good one, but at that time, the human grandmasters thought this was silly, but now you can download this kind of software for free on your phone. And every world-class grandmaster is working with computing for chess day in, day out, playing against them, learning, exploring different routes and so forth. And in the same way, I think that's someday what we'll come to art scholars approach to some of the great masterpieces. Michael Garfield (58m 2s):It just kind of recursive. You kind of imagine that portraits of the saints of art history in another 200 years might be depicted with the attributes of their attribute detection algorithms sitting on their shoulder like angels. David Stork (58m 18s):I don't envision this for a long time, but that people will create art in anticipation of it being analyzed by machines, but the economics aren't there. People, people make art to communicate with humans. And that's great. That's left us some of the greatest experiences that we can get with our eyes. Michael Garfield (58m 41s):Well, I mean, certainly we already have adversarial fashion designed to spoof facial recognition algorithms. So I mean, it doesn't seem completely out of the pail. David Stork (58m 49s):Yeah. I don't think the artists it's true. The technologists are doing this, but the artists who want to communicate something want to affect humans and that's great. Michael Garfield (59m 2s):Well, David, this has been a total joy. Where would you direct people if they want to learn more, if they want to go deeper with this material? David Stork (59m 11s):Well, the first would be the SFI recording of my talk. I have a talk online at the Frick collection, just search the Frick. Then David G Stork. I have a website which I have not updated for several years. I've been too busy search on my name and then art analysis. In the long run everyone should buy my book, pixels and paintings, Foundations of Computer Assisted Connoisseurship from Wiley. It's not yet done, but that will be sort of the compendium of this state-of-the-art up to now and just look online. Those I think are a good source. David Stork (59m 51s):Excellent. Thanks so much for talking to us today. Thanks Michael. That's great joy.

Thanks and enjoy! James Evans (0s):We're not asking questions as scientists like could fail. Why do we even need to be there? It's like science can just run like as a machine, like, we don't even need anyone to run these experiments. We just, we just do a, run, a random walker over this space of things, across papers or prior experiments. And we would discover everything that humans are going to discover, but some people do take risks. And the entire system benefits from those risks that are taken. Most of those risks don't succeed. And this is really the same in the context of social media. And we're trying to speak across boundaries and we're trying to find common ground. Most of those conversational moves. Most of the compromises that we might conceive of, or even the common languages that we try to form to facilitate conversation between people, very different perspectives and positions are not going to succeed, but the whole system benefits by trying enough of those failures that we find these new configurations that seemed inconceivable or were certainly inconceivable from the perspective of some like incremental advanced by either one.  Michael Garfield (1m 24s):In the 21st century science is a team sport played by humans and computers. Social science in particular is in the midst of a transition from the qualitative study of small groups of people to the quantitative and computer aided to study of enormous datasets created by the interactions of machines and people. In this new ecology, wanting AI to act human makes no sense, but growing alien intelligences offers useful difference and human beings find ourselves empowered to identify new questions. no one thought to ask. We can direct our scientific inquiry into the blind spots that our algorithms find for us and optimize for teams diverse enough to answer them. Michael Garfield (2m 7s):The cost is the conceit that complex systems can be fully understood and thus controlled. And this demands that we move into a paradigm of care. For both the artificial others we create and human others we engage as partners in discovery. This is the Dawn of social computing, an age of daunting risks and dazzling rewards. That promises to challenge what we think we know about what can be known and how. Welcome to complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks, to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. Michael Garfield (2m 55s):In this episode, I speak with SFI external professor James Evans, director of the University of Chicago's knowledge lab about his work in and new journal of social computing, how AI transforms the practice of scientific study and the study of scientific practice, what his research reveals about the importance of diversity in team building and innovation and what it means to accept our place beside machines in the pursuit of not just novel, scientific insights, but true wisdom. If you value our research and communication efforts, please consider making a donation@santafe.edu/podcastgive and or rating and reviewing us at Apple podcasts. Michael Garfield (3m 39s):You can find numerous other ways to engage with us at Santa //fe.edu/engage. Thank you for listening James Evans. It's a pleasure to have you on complexity podcast. James Evans (3m 52s):Thanks. Really nice to meet with you and chat, Michael. Michael Garfield (3m 55s):So I think where I'd like to start this with you, as we usually start it is with a bit of personal background because I like to humanize these ideas and this work. So just a bit of intellectual autobiography about how you came to care about and to research the ideas that we plan to discuss today would be a good place to kick it off.  James Evans (4m 19s):Sure. So I would say from a young age, I was really interested in the, you know, the big scope of history and how it is that ideas and social movements and these things changed over time. I was an anthropology undergraduate at Brigham Young University who took that kind of socio-cultural view on large kind of historical and intellectual historical movements. And then I went and worked at Harvard Business school as a researcher. And at the same time, it was kind of taking classes at Harvard. My wife was a law student there. And while there I took a wonderful class on social network analysis with Peter Marsden. And I became really interested in the idea and possibility of using these structured formal mathematical systems to think about not just connections between people, but the connections between ideas, how to represent knowledge and culture at scale. James Evans (5m 12s):And then as a graduate student back at Stanford University, I spent most of my time trying to do that, trying to build formal systems that allowed us to think about represent, measure the difference between and character of different kinds of ideological systems, knowledge-based systems, cultural systems, et cetera. And I've kind of taken that in analyzing science, writ large polarization information and misinformation, information warfare and information operations and all these kinds of things over the last 20 years. Michael Garfield (5m 47s):And so now you're in a, a rather esteemed position at the University of Chicago's department of sociology. Could you talk a little bit just about the knowledge lab and broadly what you and others are doing there? James Evans (5m 60s):Sure. How about 10 years ago? A bunch of students mostly in sociology and computer science and elsewhere and I, and some fellow faculty were really interested in building a group really patterned on this was before I joined the Santa Fe Institute, but I visited there. It was just really built on the idea of building prototypes, doing research, kind of understanding the limits of knowledge and culture, and then also kind of mocking up opportunities to push beyond those limits in various ways. So we had a commitment to playfulness, a commitment to rigor and exploration. And I would say a number of special themes of focus on innovation, on scientific and technological transformation on political polarization information and misinformation language and how language and thought interactive, et cetera. James Evans (6m 51s):And then over time, that became really a nice venue for convening things at the University of Chicago surrounding those topics and bringing in, I would say in sustaining large scale data resources that then everyone in the group could use and deploy a little more. Michael Garfield (7m 8s):So again, a lot of that shows up in the paper that I want to spend the lion's share of this conversation discussing with you, which is your piece, social computing unhinged, which came out last year in the journal of social computing. It's interesting because until I started listening in to conversations going on inside SFI, I don't think I really understood. And I don't think a lot of people really understand what a profound change is underway in the sciences over the last 20 to 30 years. And the role of the computational metaphor in understanding how science is practiced, the role of computers in that practice. Michael Garfield (7m 50s):And I'd love for you to just provide us with a brief overview of this piece. And then, then I've got kind of more granular questions for you about specific claims that you're making hypothesis that you're posing in it. James Evans (8m 3s):Sure. And I should say, I mean, that piece was, it's the first piece in the journal of social computing, Joe Soco, that I'm also the editor of chief of, so this is a piece that's intended to kind of kick off a set of post-disciplinary interdisciplinary conversations about social computing. And we'll talk about what that means, but the hope was here to really redefine social computing. Social computing as a field and topic of interest in computer science has really focused on the idea of using computers to do social things, right? So I think people think historically to the Plato system of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, that kind of birthed like news sites, blogs, email, like all the kinds of institutions that we use on the internet to kind of do social things that we did before. James Evans (8m 57s):But in new ways that we were kind of encased within this new network metaphor. But exactly, as you say, I feel like that completely undersells the range of things that social computing could be, which is the recognition. And this is really reflects the work of a number of exciting colleagues at the Santa Fe Institute, both as external faculty, those who were there, the way in which social systems are computing their own answers and computing resolutions to their own problems. Secondarily, that we have situations in which computing itself becomes a metaphor for individual and collective human cognition, right? James Evans (9m 39s):So if computers themselves are attempting in some ways to allow us to offload our cognition to them, then social computing becomes a way of really talking about how can we actually improve these computers because how do we solve our problems today? Well, through conversation argument, through building off of an accumulating on prior arguments, and then there's also on top of that, I would say this layering of actual social computing reframed in this new context, like how can you actually engineer new designs at the interface of humans and competitional devices that will allow us to do what it is that we do better, right in so far as we're computing the future through our ongoing social interactions, how can we actually build machines that can compliment human limitations and compensate for those limitations to, to allow us to think further, to think bigger, to overcome some of the range of problems that end up being enlisted in the process of polarization over specialization, the kinds of things that limit the ways in which we think and bias the ways in which we think. Michael Garfield (10m 50s):So just to, in a kind of a metta way, zoom in and enhance on one of the points that you just touched on. You make an interesting analogy here in this piece to the ship of Theseus and Greek mythology and how you're changing the parts of something. And until you you're forcing the question of whether or not that thing is actually the same thing anymore, and you say, this is what's going on. And it has been going on in the sciences and elsewhere in the piece, you talk about high throughput, big data research, and, you know, the use of things not limited to, but including deep neural networks, machine learning, generative adversarial networks, et cetera, as adjuncts to social science. Michael Garfield (11m 32s):And that, that really like this, this paper comes out of an acknowledgement that the way that science has performed is not in certain important ways, the way that it was performed. And I think a little bit of history on, on how that transformation has actually unfolded since the 1990s and the era of agent-based models and their prominence would be really interesting. James Evans (11m 56s):Sure, absolutely. First, let me just take us way back to like Robert hook in the Rose society. This is like the first society that's by scientists, forces scientists, you know, develop an emerged in the 1660s and here Robert hook comes out with this idea of prosthetics, like instruments as prosthetics that overcome, you know, human limitations that are the result of the fall of Adam. You know, you kind of like have this whole rendering of instruments is extending human sensory capacity, computational capacity. And that's the way in which they should be thought of as like they're human limitations. So we can kind of transcend those limitations. And I think really that's the way in which one might think about some of these computational opportunities. James Evans (12m 42s):I think it's the first place to start thinking about them. It's not the last place. And I think I talked about artificial intelligence in this piece here as really a terrible ending point for example. In the way, in which one might think about computational intelligence in the sense that we've got seven plus billion humans on the earth and the most strategical and ethical investment cannot be creating machines that will displace them. It has to be in creating machines that will do things that they can't do, and that can link them together in ways that they couldn't be linked together before. And so this is the ship of Theseus idea that as we're replacing these pieces, these new pieces, aren't exactly like the old pieces. James Evans (13m 23s):And if we select those designs, right, those replacements piece by piece to counteract limitations, biases to compliment the existing pieces, then the entire enterprise becomes a very different thing. And I think ancient based models are interesting. They, as you said, I mean merged 30 years ago in some ways, you know, in the 1990s. And I would say they've become really important again in the age of large scale data. And why is that well, because how do you have a hypothesis? The answer to any hypothesis in that context is like an enormous, super high dimensional data scape. So it's like, what's, what's the question to which that thing is an answer? James Evans (14m 5s):And the answer is there's no human question to which that's an answer. And so I would say agent-based models and other kinds of simulations, which aren't necessarily, agent-based where you take a hypothesis from first principles and you simulate that hypothesis in an agent-based scenario, or in some other scenario, the creates basically a world of simulated or hypothesized data that you can lay on top of the actual data. And I think one of the powerful advances really in the last 15 years, or even the last for the last decade has been the way in which neural networks and other kinds of data compression approaches are allowing the massive integration of very different kinds of data, of images and film and text and tables and the results of these simulations and these hypotheses. James Evans (14m 60s):So basically all of a sudden, now you can basically put, you know, your questions or your expectations and the data inside like the same framework at the same time. And what that analysis to do is, is develop machines that are smart enough to anticipate what will surprise us to anticipate what we will find interesting. So rather than just like generating uncle loads of garbage with unsupervised approaches, these approaches can difference what it is that they find from what it is that we expect to identify precisely the kinds of things that we would find interesting, not to say that those are the only things that we should explore, but it will dramatically augment human capacity to imagine and explore. Michael Garfield (15m 43s):So you make an interesting point about this in the piece where you talk about quoting Sue Suchow and Griffiths experimental design as algorithm design and how this changes the way that we think about trying to take random samples. And instead it's like you just said, it's a shift towards inference where you're leaning on the machine and the machine is leaning on you in order to actually guide research into a space. You know, I remember thinking about Jennifer Dunn's work on trophic networks, and I guess maybe this is a little different, but it seems like that kind of a model seems like it could be transposed into other settings, like the kind of inferential work that you're alluding to here in understanding where new technologies might emerge or that kind of thing. Michael Garfield (16m 36s):And you talk about in here, you talk about this process of machine assisted inference. You say a nature article published in 2019 revealed how embedding chemicals and properties to a vector space from millions of prior research publications can be used to predict 40% of the novel associations, more than two decades into the future. So this seems like a shift that I've heard, Kevin Kelly, who's also a big proponent of what you talk about in this paper as alien intelligence, rather than simply reproducing human intelligence also said that, you know, we're, we're moving out of an era where the answers have the priority in value to an era work, finding the right questions, takes the priority. Michael Garfield (17m 20s):And to just wrap this weird bouquet of stuff, you end this piece in a really kind of bold statement that I love. It's, you know, it's in the hope of this chaotic conversation, partly beyond human comprehension, certainly at the risk of peril that we launched the journal of social computing, that like in a way, you know, this interfacing with the cognitive other in order to improve the way that we search the space of possible scientific discovery is putting us back into the rainforest. We're no longer an apex predator. And consequently it changes what we believe is possible with science in terms of actually landing on a final or unified theories. Michael Garfield (18m 9s):And yeah, I'd love to hear you talk a little bit more just about the, the epistemic and paradigmatic shift underway with all of that.  James Evans (18m 18s):Yeah, no, no. I think these are really exciting and strange developments and I think it is at the risk of which I'll talk about in just a moment. I think the idea is if we are going to work with this realm of, of possible intelligences of computational intelligences, when we talked about experimental design is algorithm design. In some ways that's kind of like taking those intelligences down into the small setting. So for example, typically in the social sciences, we love to run surveys. We love to do mid-scale the small scale experiments in which, you know, you'll gather a hundred people, 200 people, 500 people, maybe a thousand people for survey, maybe 10,000 people. James Evans (19m 2s):And, and the idea is you designed that all up front because you kind of imagined, well, what don't we know? What do we know? How are we going to like balance the sample so that it can kind of teach us the things that we anticipate that we might want to know, but that's not what you would actually do. If you could think between asking each person each question, right? If you could ask a person a question, some answers they would give you would raise new questions. Other times if they gave you a certain answer, then you wouldn't have to ask most of the questions that you fall. Like everything becomes predictable. Like, you know, if you know, someone's from a certain place and they voted for a certain person and there were a certain thing and they like a certain food and they own a certain kind of gun, then there, there are many questions that you don't have to ask because so many things are correlated in this case, in this universe. James Evans (19m 53s):And so you would ask another kind of question, right? To maximize the information value of your time with that person in the same way that you, when you're having a podcast, like you don't have a rigid set of like five questions, right? Cause you asked one question and the person has nothing to say, and then you ask another question that's really compelling, but no, I've got to move on to my next question. So I'm going to stop the interesting stream of answers. They're not, you don't do that. No one intelligent would do that. And so pushing, you know, experimental design to algorithm design allows us to basically put some intelligence between every single question that we ask. So you've got some agent that's kind of computing, Oh, as a result of that question that you asked in this survey, I'm going to ask you this other question. James Evans (20m 34s):I'm going to give you this other information task. Or if I'm running a teams experiment like I am right now. I'm using Bazin optimization. So after, you know, every single team-based experiment, then it comprises the optimal next experiment, just the very next experiment that we run immediately afterwards, that takes into account what we learned from that last experiment and everything we knew before. Or in chemistry, where if you're, obviously, if you've got some enormous design space like this 10 variables, there's 20 different kinds of chemicals at various titrations, you're going to try to mix, the possibilities are just explosive. And so you can't sample randomly sample all those possibilities or you could, but then you'd be wasting most of your time on useless information. James Evans (21m 21s):So part of it is about projecting that kind of intelligence into the small, between every question between every step of every experiment, applying the same kind of logic, creativity, intelligence, curiosity, using these computational prosthetics. But as you say, it also goes to the large, right? So if we're going to create intelligences, which are fundamentally complimentary to us, they're going to have different capacities than we have. They're likely also going to have different goals than we have. And that puts us at odds or puts us in conflict with the way in which many people thought about the problem of algorithmic in artificial intelligence, which they think of as a control problems to Russell and a number of other scholars, Nick Bostrom among others. James Evans (22m 12s):The way to deal with this is to think about it as a control problem. What we're trying to do is create Alison Gopnik describes it as the Stepford Wives approach to containment. So we're going to try to kind of create like bots that tightly tethered their desires to us. They only want exactly what we want. We want nothing else than our satisfaction. And the problem is that's not going to create things that are complimentary. It's not going to create things that really can expand our own capacity, but what's the alternative to control. I would say with Patricia Churchland and with Alison Gopnik and others, well caregiving, but caregiving puts you, it's true in a very different status position. James Evans (22m 55s):Like the one that you were discussing you know, like you're the rainforest again, you're not the apex predator. I mean, if you're controlling, you are the alpha, right. And you're telling that algorithm to do exactly what it is that you want it to do. You're anticipating what it's going to do that you don't like. And you're going to abrogate that from the outset, becoming a caregiver to these algorithms so that they can explore and discover the range of capacities, which are not your capacity, which may beyond your capacity to send so cognize or anticipate puts you in a lower status position. Caregiver is the one who respects the fact that the one they're giving care to may have potential that they don't have. James Evans (23m 36s):And that, that discovery process is, I mean, in some ways they hope that those desires and capacities can be used for good of the one that they're giving care to. But there is epistemic risk if we are allowing, for example, more and more of our science to be in the quote, unquote know, heads of these digital algorithms, you know, it's like a thousand dimensional tensor. And that, that may be actually the most parsimonious descriptions, certain kinds of social and physical phenomenon. Then that's, that's basically building a system where we can understand very little about what is understood and that is a precarious position. James Evans (24m 16s):And yet it's also, you know, if we were to think about really the kind of explosive technological achievements and even business achievements, the last two centuries, since the second, since the first industrial revolution, that's all about complimentary technologies. That's all about the evolution of these technologies with persons to create like radical augmentations to human capacity. And so to forgo, the possibility of those potentials is kind of inconceivable. I mean, not everyone's going to do that, right. And so we need to learn how to do that. We need to develop a kind of epistemic humility as you suggest that would allow us to do it in the most reasoned and careful way. Michael Garfield (24m 59s):So there's, yeah, there's a lot of juicy stuff there. I think just to suppose this, I'm thinking about a couple years ago, we'll link to this in the show notes. One of the SFI symposium, Melanie Mitchell, gave a talk on boom and bust cycles and AI development. And it just speaks to the relative value of creating an other, creating something that we can't understand. And, and to which we're in a position of caregiving instead of control that, you know, you look at how we've actually gotten to where we are now. And it's through things like the calculator that are radically other and augmenting us rather than replacing us. Compare that to the thousands of years of perennial interest there has been in the creation of humanoid automata. Michael Garfield (25m 46s):And it seems like, well, we know where the, the research incentives actually lie if we look at this, but you know, there's this other piece, which I think is a little bit more interesting, which is as a parent, but long before I was a parent, I was thinking a lot about this in terms of like Hans Moravec and his idea of mind to children. And like you're saying, you know, this, this notion that when we give birth to something new in this world, all new technologies have these unintended knock-on consequences and all we can do is hope to raise them right. And so it's, it's interesting. You speak to this tension. I love this idea that you float in this paper where if the goal is to create diverse cognitive groups, then actually the Turing test is the complete wrong set of optimizations that like actually concealment of purpose may be critical, competitive performance and failing the Turing test is the best stealth. Michael Garfield (26m 48s):And so you talk about, again, you talk about bringing the logic of generative adversarial networks into the way that we design human machine collaborations. And I think that there's an implication here also that is kind of suggested by other research that you've done interrogating the difference between qualitative and quantitative research that I feel like wherever I look in your work, there's this extremely strong argument for bringing in outsiders for unpredictable interdisciplinarity. And we're talking about this entirely in the realm of human, social scientists and computers, but it seems equally true of, you know, arts, the, the, the interplay between science and philosophy or science and art, which you mentioned here in terms of how quantum theory emerged out of a particular philosophical context that was committed to challenging notions of causality. Michael Garfield (27m 49s):So I don't know, that's just a lot to throw up on the table. James Evans (27m 54s):It's true that there's a lot of ideas here, but one of the things that I was inspired by when you mentioned this kind of artistic rendering of this as Ted Chang's novella The Lifecycle of Software Objects, where there's this setting in which you have precisely this, you know, kind of human caregivers that are trying to provide experiences of these kinds of bots. And I think it's, it is true that I've systematically seen. And, and, and, and we, you know, of the broader scholarly community of seen in this idea of the wisdom of crowds, which really emerged was articulated by Francis Gulland. Then this 1906 nature paper, really for the first time, it shows that a bunch of people would go to this stock fair in England. James Evans (28m 41s):And they, you know, they're all kind of betting on the size of this big steer. And there, they, you know, they put on their, you know, their bets and the average should in theory been the median, but the average was much better than any particular persons that, and we know that this typically comes from a diversity of approaches like algorithmic approaches for calculating these things and a diversity of experiences. The fact is, you know, those people were that stock fair, like had cows at home. They knew how much those weighed, like that's why they were at the fair presumably to sell or to buy these things. And so it seems like we're in a place where we can value existing diversity and we can begin to design diversity that would allow us to kind of think beyond ourselves. James Evans (29m 28s):And that's, I think that the exciting position that we're in. You mentioned piece that I described at the end of this piece, and it's associated with a, a paper that we're working on, hopefully finishing within the next few days in which we, we did look at this algorithm that was put out by some scientists in association with Berkeley, a number of colleagues there who put up this piece where they use these AI down betting algorithms to identify from the literature, the likelihood of these long distance publications. And we were really interested in that. We're interested in, okay, so what if we garnered all the literature, right? Then you can, that's bring a crowd together. And as you mentioned, that predicts about 40% with about 40% precision proposals so that materials that will have certain valuable energy related properties in the next 20 years. We tried to basically say, what if we actually took that intelligence, but then we actually took actually into account the relative position of persons in that landscape. We tried to design against that. We tried to design things that work sitting in the places that people are sitting in. So basically we kind of identified all these persons in that landscape. We built a new landscape that proposed hypotheses that would avoid where people were. It would avoid the kinds of questions that people would ask. In fact, we would only ask the kinds of questions that there are no people present to make those inferences are asked. James Evans (30m 56s):And it turns out when we lay that on top of really strong simulations of the likelihood, for example, these energy related properties like thermal electricity, that the proposals are no less likely than those that happened to be championed by individual scientists. I mean, it suggested to me the pilot and actually by including those humans, of course, you can like double the predictive of the out of box instead of predicting 40% precision precipitating at 85 or 90% precision because we recognize we're not just predicting the things that are true. We're predicting the things that are true, which people will publish. And again, that allows us to turn that around and use those to accomplish, to radically compliment human communities. James Evans (31m 38s):And so I think one of the things that's striking is to do this right, to build a kind of new AI, like an augmented alternative intelligence and intelligence that really designs diversity on to radically expand human capacity and potential requires actually those algorithms to know us much better than they would have otherwise. Rather than just mapping on the outcomes, making sure the outcomes like match human level outcomes are like human level outcomes, but like a little marginally faster or cheaper than human level outcomes. Here we're in radically different position where we're targeting things that the educational system is designed against asking those kinds of questions. James Evans (32m 23s):And so like, we actually need to understand human bias, cognitive bias, you know, like social conflict and like to understand all those things allows us to grow computational intelligence is that can really help us do things that we could not otherwise do. And to help us do the kinds things that we do.  Michael Garfield (32m 41s):So this raises a, an issue that keeps me up at night, which is that all of the advancements that have been driven by market forces to give us things like the Netflix recommendation algorithm or, you know, at least to apply and develop those ideas for these insights to find purchase in society and, and to be taken up by these enormous private corporate research teams and, and developed into the way they have transformed the world. Now, a lot of this stuff is being used to isolate people. It's rendering us with evermore granularity in, in order to make us more legible to machines that are serving a set of incentives that is deeply out of alignment with what you just described. Michael Garfield (33m 31s):And in the section where you're talking about how re-imagining human computer interaction and human centered computing as social computing, again, you know, we're kind of orbiting this, but you know, you talk about incorporating principles like diversity, promoting collective creativity and intelligence through the creation of cognitive dissonance and destabilizing conflict. And like, arguably, we've done this on accident with social media algorithms that have driven wedges between already polarized groups. And yet you make this key point here, which is that how much cognitive dissonance is too much. Like you say, Oh, interlocutors who disagree must nevertheless be able to communicate. Michael Garfield (34m 13s):And so I'm thinking about this paper that just came out from a set of researchers at Caltech, identifying not only interdisciplinarity and a couple other key features, but specifically the establishment of a common language as a hugely important piece of this. So it's sort of maybe like how do you swallow the spider to catch the fly kind of a problem? How do we find the balance here? James Evans (34m 40s):Yeah, I would say, I'd say your discussion here stimulates two things that I think are interesting. So one is this idea of common language and communication is it does suggest that you want to create, I mean, there's a tension, right? So if you're, and the same is true, the same is true actually in population, genetics is, is, and human communication. If species are too far apart, right. Or they become too far apart, they, they actually ceased to be what we call viable species because of, you know, say geo-physical separations, then all of a sudden they can't exchange DNA, right? They can't have sex. And so they become evolutionarily irrelevant to each other in many ways. On the other hand, if they're like in the same population experiencing the same phenomenon, then they're also irrelevant to each other, which is to say they don't bring anything new. James Evans (35m 29s):Whereas if you have them in two different environments and they're responding to different kinds of pressures, then basically that different environments are driving. Evolution is driving them to generate novel traits that become relevant to one another. This is the phenomenon biology that I would say is still understood or underappreciated, which is this phenomenon of hybrid vigor, which is where, you know, you've got like sub species that are far enough apart, and yet they're able to procreate, they're able to have sex. And so the communication between those species becomes substantively valuable and they have performance enhanced properties across, you know, the planting and the animal kingdom, what we've observed, et cetera. James Evans (36m 13s):And I think the same is true for the scientific spaces. Like we need to develop enough of a common language. I would say, a partial, common, a common language, which facilitates interchange and novelty and surprise through that communication. And yet, you know, not so much of a common language when I say so much for coming on, I'm really thinking about back to like live nets. And for again, all these other, you know, computational and social and natural scientists who really fantasized about the idea of, of what they call the concept script variously. Forget what would his book progress shift the concept script, where every symbol has like an unambiguous link to some concept in the world. James Evans (36m 58s):And I think that would be terrible for innovation. It would be great for innovation in the short term, because all of a sudden now you get everything and you can basically create a common editorial machine that explores through the space of all those interactions. The problem is that it kills the generativity of each of those concepts to kind of like spin off concepts that are edits periphery, differentiate themselves from that concept by counter position, et cetera. So I think the idea of kind of creating these universal languages ends up creating a system in which that that's potentially harmful. I mean, I would say decidedly harmful for longterm innovation. The thing that keeps you up at night, I think is something that's slightly different. James Evans (37m 42s):And I think we definitely see an analog of it in science. So I've looked at scientific attention for really decades. And one of the things that we know, and we can show and has been shown by others over and over again, is that basically, if you want to maximize the expected value of your citations, of people, other people recognizing you in scientific space, you will publish nearby them in kind of topic space, right? If I'm relevant to them, I'm publishing things that are nearby, that other people will pick up on those. Other people will credit me for those that have to credit me for those, given the kind of the moral political economy of that space. And so if we're going to optimize citation metrics like citation impact the number of citations that a particular paper has or career citations, then that's systemically creates a situation in which people are driven away from leaving the herd, you know, leading the pack. James Evans (38m 37s):If they leave the path, then they have the potential to do something radically different. If they don't do something that's radically different, that succeeds the kills, like all that other work that everyone else was doing, there are very strong vested interest in non killing. Then they won't get the attention that one might imagine and hope for if one wanted a robust evolving scientific frontier. And I would say that algorithms are doing a very similar thing in the social media world. They're trying to predict you. And so they're trying to anticipate what you're going to click on. You know, what's going to be most interesting to you by building a really narrow model of what it is that, that you might find interesting. And then they're trying to populate with that, with those things that they expect that you will like in that space. James Evans (39m 21s):And again, following those same incentives, they're going to try to create things that are really close. I mean, the things that are right nearby you are the things individual that have the greatest likelihood that you're going to click on them, which kind of, again, if you just turn that crank and that creates filter bubbles and echo chambers in which people, you know, are in deep conversation, only with themselves. On the other hand thing for thing that will be the most interesting for you are things that most of them will not be interesting for you. And so I think this is the same with science, but we want things that have the potential to fail. If we're not looking at things, we're not asking questions as scientists, for example, that could fail then like, why do we even need to be there? James Evans (40m 4s):Like then, you know, it's like science can just run like as a machine, you know, it's just kind of, you know, like we don't even need anyone to run these experiments. We just, we just do a, run, a random walker over the space of things across papers or prior experiments. And, and we would discover everything that humans are going to discover, but some people do take risks. And the entire system benefits from those risks that are taken. Most of those risks don't succeed. And I think this is really the same in the context of social media, when we're trying to speak across boundaries and we're trying to find common ground. Most of those conversational moves most of the compromises that we might kind of conceive of, or even the common languages that we try to form to facilitate conversation between people. Very different perspectives and positions are things that are not going to succeed, but the whole system benefits by trying enough of those failures that we find these new configurations that seemed inconceivable or were certainly inconceivable from the perspective of someone incremental advanced by either one. James Evans (41m 6s):So I think, I, I think of both, I would say like political discourse, you know, we're trying to find meaningful compromise configurations and really scientific advances. What we're trying to kind of find things that your harvest, the advances in one area and channel them to another are ones where, you know, they're fraught with, you know, high likelihood of failure. And if we don't incentivize the potential and the willingness to undertake those failures, then we're not going to be able to experience the upside. You're not going to be able to experience that kind of where inconceivable position that beyond the structure of any existing system. That's where we need to go, but we can't build it out from the politically liberal conservative position. It has to be a new configuration of those things that requires potentially a new language and most such innovations are going to fail. James Evans (41m 57s):But again, you know, doing that requires, for example, with science funding, it just requires a completely different mindset with congressional scrutiny over like every single grant that, you know, it's like, Oh, this is a stupid thing to do. Most things should be stupid. Like we need to, you know, if we want to actually harvest the events that we need to really amp up the kind of inconceivable projects, that high likelihood of failure projects. And I think we can harvest computation to help us again, think outside of ourselves, by nudging them to positions that are either collectively or individually inconceivable by thinking different ways by attending to, and having different educations than we can or have chosen to provide a result for institutions, et cetera. Understanding the way in which we organize ourselves, like taking that social science into these machines allows us to design them for diversity in a really directed way. James Evans (42m 53s):So it makes it possible. Michael Garfield (42m 55s):You know, it seems almost like what we were talking about, about using computers for inference to identify these unoccupied spaces where we can go explore. It seems like what you're saying is that it's a similar approach to developing computer mediators, like a marriage counselor that both parties of the marriage had a problem with each other, but now they have the luxury of a problem with the counselor. James Evans (43m 28s):I think when you can create machines that can create those kinds of problems. That's beautiful. Michael Garfield (43m 33s):I mean, I just, you know, something that came up for me listening to you talk about all this is that I think you may have already addressed this, but just to, just to be super clear on this point, the skewed incentive structure for science that produces expected return on investment for individuals looking to maximize citations are for organizations that are looking to actually, you know, see technological returns on their funding or whatever. It speaks again, to what I see happening online, which is in the human technology co-evolution and lots of people have written about this as the machines become more and more responsive as they take on more and more of our externalized formerly considered human uniqueness. Michael Garfield (44m 21s):And, you know, you follow Herrera Rivera gave a great tech talk at Google about this a few years ago about the new religion of Silicon Valley that were emptying what we thought of as the singular human into this new framework of understanding a person as merely a collection of algorithms. And those algorithms are tuning themselves to their environment. Like all my artist friends that have learned to hack the Instagram social media algorithm. And it looks just like the kind of failure that Melanie Mitchell and Jessica Flack wrote about it at Ion in terms of key performance indicators and academic grading and how you end up not actually measuring the things you want. Michael Garfield (45m 5s):And you've created these people who are just excellent test takers. So part of what's keeping me up at night is this dehumanizing elements. And, you know, maybe that's inevitable, maybe I'm being old-fashioned. James Evans (45m 18s):Well, maybe you can help me understand just a little bit more. I mean, I think certainly the key performance indicator idea is a flattening of the high dimensional qualities that research and the persons possess, you know, more valuating like well research portfolio. Then we basically put high stakes on a single indicator. This is talked about all over the social sciences. In fact, everyone's developed their own law for this, right? The Lucas critique and economics, Goodhart's law and political science Campbell's law and sociology,  It's all the same thing, which is basically that if you have a quality indicator, then basically creates this incentive to capture the indicator without capturing the quality. James Evans (45m 59s):So then that drives down the correlation between the indicator and the quality, and then you get garbage, right? So this is the scenario that you're describing. And one way of dealing with that is to not have like one indicator, but rich diversity of indicators. If you have a single indicator, this is what happens. Like everyone tried, well, how do we get citations without like writing a mindblowing piece that I can't conceive of how to write? Well, then I'm gonna do, I'm gonna hack the system. I'm gonna hack the Instagram algorithm and hack whatever. And I think this is also the way in which we need to think about building our machines, right? If we, if they have a single objective function that's maximized, this is that it is precisely actually the control based criticism of like Nick Bostrom created some huge machine that's going to turn, you know, it's going to create paperclips. James Evans (46m 46s):And that's the only thing that we validate, the only thing that we value, then it's going to like turn the whole world and the paperclips, sorry, it's going to, it could, it could go a ride. These kinds of machines could go, right. But that's not what we do because when we're searching for everything from a mate to a good idea, we're not looking for like a single key performance indicator. At the very least with thinking of an archetype, right. Which is like a bundle of many qualities. And at most we don't know what we're looking for. We're actually looking for something that seems right. And that feels right, which means like it literally, we're basically saying that it registers and all these kinds of sensors that we can't even enumerate, that we don't even know exist. James Evans (47m 30s):And so I guess what I'm suggesting is that if we want to avoid these kinds of challenges, we need to basically build a much richer, diverse array of sensors that captured the diverse array of qualities. So for example, okay, I hate renderings of the scientific method like, like that there is a scientific method and that you can score it. So recently I was, I was working with my daughter on a kind of math, science fair thing. And there was like, you know, there's a scientific method that it's being scored against in the Chicago public school district. And you look at all the pieces of the method, you realize that, that the experiment that would have to win in the end has to be like a town cleaner comparison. James Evans (48m 14s):You know, you can like replicate it many different times. You can validate, you know, its existence under a variety of different conditions that have this certainty over something that's completely irrelevant, you know, about, you know, brand A versus brand B you know, it's like 1% better, but statistically significantly, absolutely 1% better. So I think we need to blow up the, the idea that there's like a solitary, singular objective function. And I think, you know, we need to provide not just humans and humans institutions, but also these algorithms themselves with like rich compliments of objectives with competing objectives of balancing objectives, which is how it is that we make every important decision in our lives, because there are multiple things that we value. James Evans (49m 4s):And often we don't even enumerate those precisely because we don't know what we value until we're in the act of discovering that thing, you know, like a partner like you, you know, how do you, how do you know what you value until you have discovered the thing that you've come to value? So I couldn't agree with you more that there is a drive to kind of like to reduce these objectives, you know, to create singular key performance indicators. And I think this is that AI piece that you were mentioning really pushes against that in a way that's powerfully productive. And I would say is definitely something that is achievable in the context of not only human institutions, but also in terms of artificial intelligence. James Evans (49m 46s):Like the kinds of artificial intelligence is that we would hand over important decisions or, or hold hands with and making those important decisions are ones that are going to explore the space of values and explore a range of indicators that capture those qualities and balance those, right, those high dimensional qualities in ways that allow us to trust the judgment and wisdom of those kinds of algorithms. And we wouldn't even conceive of it as wisdom if it didn't undertake to account for various values, right. That's what makes something wise is that it's not a singular objective function. It takes into account the range of objective functions often across the range of people that make up design Michael Garfield (50m 31s):Well, Olay. Yeah. One of the, one of the things that all of this brings up for me is how this entire conversation nests inside this other broader epistemic shift about, you know, the discovery of the ecological reality of identity, the microbiome research discovery and psychology of heating neural motifs, that all sort of take turns presenting as the self. And so in that way, nothing that we've said is truly challenging to this new relational and network-based sense of an emergent identity, the self as a plural process, the whole thing, feral child language development that, you know, we are social creatures, but we're social creatures that all of these different scales at once. Michael Garfield (51m 23s):And we're social creatures again, across all of these substrates. So I'm about to ask a little bit more of a personal question than I usually do on this show, which is stewing in this, as you do full time, what have you noticed are the consequences for you and how you understand what James Evans is and, and how you exist in this world? Because I think that the answer to that question seems like it may be a useful guidepost along the way to resolving some of the anxieties that people seem to possess about what is happening to the human in the 21st century. James Evans (52m 7s):Whoa, Olay back at you. I think I certainly don't know my personal answer is going to solve the critical question about a merchant identity. Again, at the same time, I couldn't agree more that I think there's a really strong seeming correlation between these ideas of emerging identity and diversity in composition and the way in which I'm arguing that we should push machines on the one hand and this human machine nexus on the other, right. How we basically designed diversity to kind of do it as that, what we want to do. And of course that becomes complicated because then that also increases the diversity of wants that we want, et cetera, et cetera. James Evans (52m 49s):For me, I think there are benefits and costs. On the one hand, I think it does mean that I'm a loosely coupled system, you know, so all kinds of different commitments, many of which are in conflict with one another. And I've become very comfortable with my ignorance and very comfortable with that conflict. And I don't seek to resolve, I mean, it's a part of doing the science of science or kind of Metta science is like I'm bringing together theories from very different places that have very different idioms that are saying very different things. And I'm hesitant to try to resolve them too, because when we resolved them too quickly, that almost always means that one is dominating the other, that we're basically just kind of like cheaply taking a rank order. James Evans (53m 35s):And we're allowing one to kind of drive rather than understanding the emergent puzzle, right? That these things can configure into. Like, what's the possibility that if we could take advantage of the strengths of all these different things, like what what's possible, that's not possible in the context of any of these different systems. So part of it is a kind of a radical hope that emergence will allow us to exceed the hopes of any one of these different systems. I think the costs are that you're kind of an outsider to every system in some sense,.  You're constantly telling every system about things that it feels like are foreign to it and potentially alien and destabilizing to it. James Evans (54m 16s):And that it forces you. And I, when I say we, as a system need to become comfortable with failure, it forces me as an individual to become really comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty and kind of amp up that uncertainty as we've put together more and more pieces of this emergent puzzle that we hope. And we have evidence from the past that those like radically different pieces have created things that are vastly greater than the sum of their parts. Michael Garfield (54m 45s):Wow. You know, you really just spoke to something that seems to come up a lot in the context of interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary research, which is how it creates a chronic endemic imposter syndrome. That's like, that's a thing that I remember the SFI research undergraduates were very lively discussion about the fact. And they were like, Oh, the senior faculty were coming in and no, no, all of us deal with that all the time. You know, you can only be an expert in so many things and you're living in this big complex world. So, you know, maybe the right place to end, this would be to invite you to propose a question that you feel in genders or affords really useful, potentially transformative ambiguity. Michael Garfield (55m 37s):Like what are you chewing on? Or what do you recommend that listeners chew on that they may never be able to fully digest, but might get us somewhere interesting. James Evans (55m 50s):That's you know, that it's a tough question to answer, Michael. And the reason it's tough is because in some ways I I've spent and I'm certainly spending most of my career right now, trying to build machines that can basically pose an answer, some of these questions that we can't actually conceive of. Right. So you're basically kind of asking, you know, what, what's give me like a one nexus, not like thousand nexuses, ones that you know, that each of us can kind of like conceive of together. And I would say that this is what SFI does so well. So if you look at any of the other podcasts that you've done or elsewhere, these are cases where people were kind of asking these kinds of questions. James Evans (56m 32s):They're saying, okay, you know, what, if we've got a system particles in this field and we've got like a bunch of humans that are interacting kind of in this space, and we've got some formalism here and to what degree can we transfer this class of models to like, describe an aluminate what's going on in this other context. And so basically I I'm spending time just building machines that generate thousands of those and dozens of, you know, some of those are things that, you know, make sense to people. I mean, like that, you know, we can kind of see that like look at that model and we can kind of like imagine that social network and we can like put those two things together and we can ask the question, does it generate insight? James Evans (57m 14s):Does it predict better things that we're doing right now than things that were being done before, et cetera, et cetera. So for me, it's, it's, it, it would be difficult to just pick one thing. I mean, I think there are, I mean, one that I've been thinking about is the relationship between a hybrid vigor and innovation, right? This idea of, you know, how do we think about this across all scales, which is to say, you know, how do we create a system that, you know, if you get two particles that are outside the kind of like the speed of light space, time, calm, then what's possible for them to, if they combined create something beautiful and amazing or terrifying and horrible, but they, they will never interact. James Evans (57m 60s):Right. So how do we, how do we actually create diversity that facilitates, I would call it sustainable innovation, right? How do we build a system that generates enough diversity that we can sustain really radical innovation and prosperity in the future? And I think this is something that happens in the biological system and it happens in like the social system that happens in physical systems. And so I think finding ways to build that sustainable growth and the draws on all these systems that observe it right, and have tried to formalize it in their own separate ways is something that I think is potentially really powerful way of building more models and achieving certainly above and beyond the advances of any one of these particular domains. Michael Garfield (58m 49s):Well, I mean, it certainly seems like that's the trillion dollar question in human resources, right. If only if only we could hire this way instead of looking for the person we think is going to perform best in this. Yeah. So anyway, James, this has been a total delight. I want to thank you so much for being on the show. Any parting thoughts, final words for folks before we go? James Evans (59m 14s):No, I, I mean, I I've really appreciated your questions and kind of pushing me to, to think and rethink these, these kinds of ideas. I, with respect to this last idea of imposter syndrome, you know, I just, I really hope that we can cultivate more imposters.  Michael GarfieldSo abducting them into our research and abduct the rest of us into, you know,  James EvansKind of like a bigger world of imagination. So. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you.

Thanks and enjoy:Doyne Farmer (0s):Do you figure out what people are going to do when confronted with an economic decision, by assuming they have a utility function that tells them what they want and they know all the possible events that might happen in the future, and they know the probabilities of those events. And then they do a calculation to find the decision that maximizes their utility and therefore take that decision. There are circumstances where that's a reasonable thing to assume. Like if you're designing an auction where you've got specialists thinking really carefully about what's going on, where the world is really constrained, you may actually know the probabilities of the events and that you may know all the possible events and you may be able to solve that. But in the real world, if you're talking about climate change or inequality or financial crises, we don't have good models for what's happening. Doyne Farmer (46s):We may not even be able to anticipate all the things that could happen in that kind of world. The world we've evolved in people, reason differently. People use heuristics, people imitate their neighbors, or pick an example out at random, then just follow that. But the reason in a very bounded way, it's just a whole different way of modeling human behavior than the way economists currently do it. Michael Garfield (1m 32s):Once upon a time at UC Santa Cruz, a group of Renegade grad students started mixing physics with math and computers, determined to discover underlying patterns in the seeming randomness of systems like the weather and roulette. Their research led to major insights in the emerging field of chaos theory and eventually to the new discipline complexity economics, which brings models from ecology and physics, cognitive science, and biology together to improve our understanding of how value flows through networks, how people make decisions and how new technologies evolve as the human world weaves new global economic systems and sustainability looms ever larger in importance. Michael Garfield (2m 16s):It is finally time to heat the warnings and the promises of this new paradigm of economics. Welcome to complexity, the official podcast at the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks, to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe this week on complexity, we speak with SFI external professor J Duane farmer at Oxford to tour his 50 years pioneering work and current book in progress. The complexity economics revolution topics include how ecology inspires forms of macro Economics, how bounded rationality changes the narrative about rational self-interested economic actors, how leverage leads to greater instability, how new tools can help us predict emerging innovations and engineer, a better banking system, the skewed incentives of science funding, and venture capital. Michael Garfield (3m 20s):His take on cryptocurrencies and more.

Give you can find numerous other ways to engage with us at Santa fe.edu/engage. Thank you for Jay Duane farmer. It's a pleasure to have you on complexity podcast. Well, it's a pleasure to be here in preparation for this. You sent me a draft galley of your upcoming book, the complexity economics revolution. And so, as I was just telling you a moment ago before we started recording, I think using the way that you have organized this book as a kind of spine for this conversation makes the most sense, which I think humorously drops us directly into one of the deepest questions we could ask on this show, which is a question about the nature of randomness and prediction. Michael Garfield (4m 19s):So if you're up for it, maybe the right place to start would be to talk about how your journey to complexity economics began at the university of California Santa Cruz. Doyne Farmer (4m 31s):Sure. Well, I guess, you know, one of my revelations, or let's say after cogitating on what randomness is for a long, long time is a randomness is really a subjective property. It depends on what you know, and you know, the first seminal event that caused me to realize that was my experience predicting relapse, where, you know, rillettes designed to be a random number generator, but if you know, information that most people don't like the position and velocity of a ball, when it's sprouts and the equation of motion, then you can make a roulette and do it more predictable system where the numbers aren't random anymore. And in a sense, that's a good metaphor for what science does. Michael Garfield (5m 12s):Science takes phenomenon. It seems fluky and arbitrary and difficult to understand and gives us insight into causal mechanisms that may explain what they do and make the events around us less random. Could you tell a little bit more about the project that actually like how you actually kind of came to this understanding because this is, this is one of these stories that for deep established fans of complex systems, I can imagine they already know this, but for some of the listeners like my buddy Mitch, you provided the music for this show and used to be a professional gambler, a card counter in Vegas. I think this is the kind of story that really situates the history of this science in some, some escapades that are worth. Michael Garfield (5m 58s):Yeah, Doyne Farmer (5m 59s):Well, the story began when Norman Packard and I, who had both been pursuing gambling as a way to make money as a summer job, me playing poker and Norman County blackjack, Norman had the realization together with his friend Jack piles. That roulette is a physical system. Therefore it should be predictable. And the key fact is that the crew K does not close the bets until a couple of seconds before the ball exits the track. So that gives you enough time. If you understand Newton's laws as applied to a roulette wheel after the crew PA releases the ball. So it's spinning around the wheel. You can measure the velocity of the ball and its position at a given point in time. Doyne Farmer (6m 43s):And we did it by putting switches in our shoes and clicking every time the ball passed a reference point. So the time it takes to go around is proportional to the losses or inversely proportional to velocity. Then we could, after solving the equations of motion for roulette ball, which is just a rolling ball on a circular track with wind resistance, we could predict where the ball was going to exit the wheel. The ball would then bounce around on the cups and the little diamonds for a while, but it turns out we were able to did a bunch of experiments to show that didn't totally randomize things. And over a saga that span quite a few years of my time in graduate school, we made 11 different trips to Nevada. Doyne Farmer (7m 24s):We spent a lot of time at the roulette wheel. We were able to beat roulette with about a 20% advantage as long as our equipment was running. But, you know, we were pushing the envelope of what was possible. We built what in hindsight, I mean, I had no idea at the time as a purse wearable digital computer, it wasn't just wearable. It was concealable. So it was small. And the initial version was stuffed under an armpit with a pack of 12 AA batteries under the other armpit, because back in those days, chips still use a lot of power Moore's law was not as far down the curve. This would be 1977 or 76 to 1980, roughly. Doyne Farmer (8m 6s):So we beat the house, but we had a lot of problems with equipment failures. And to be honest, we kind of burned out. We were also pretty nervous about getting our kneecaps broken, so we didn't have a lot of money. So we were nervous about making the stakes too big. You know, with hindsight, we should've just gone to Caesars and played with a hundred dollars chips, but we were a little too nervous about her kneecaps for that. And so it was a great learning lesson. We're the total of about 30 different people involved at one point or another. And we had a lot of fun, never really got rich as a result Michael Garfield (8m 39s):That brings us to the end of the seventies. And at that point you're at, UCFC starting to form the dynamical systems collective. And so, you know, talking about being at the edge of, you know, the frothy edge of, of innovation, you speak your book to the problem. As I think, you know, many people who are interested in studying chaos or complex systems, the problem of not having any PhD advisors that can actually advise you on early chaos theory. And so I'm curious to hear a little bit about the UCFC chaos cabal, the early sort of wild West days of this kind of research, and then how that ended up getting you to Los Alamos. Doyne Farmer (9m 27s):Well, I learned about the concept of chaos. It wasn't even called that then from my friend, Rob Shaw, who introduced us to the Lawrence equations on an analog computer and an oscilloscope screen, I was totally inspired as was my friend Norman. And we joined up with Jim Crutchfield who was an undergraduate at the time and decided that we wanted to understand that now Norman and I were really primed cause we've been banging our heads against relapse for several years. And so it clicked because we let an example, you know, that's what creates the randomness is the chaos in the trajectory of the ball. Doyne Farmer (10m 7s):We began by using the analog computer as if it were an experiment and resolve to come up with methods for, if there was a strange attractor inside of a turbulent flow, how would we show that was true. So we wrote a paper in 1980 that had a lot of influence and answering that question and we had a lot of fun, you know, the problem was there was just nobody at the university that was really equipped to be our advisor. There was no faculty members that were doing that when we started it. Some of them got interested in a bit later and, and did some things in the end, but they were very kind of generous in letting us pursue that. Despite the fact that, you know, we were just co-advising each other. And we were kind of lucky in being in the right place in the right time and doing that before anybody else did. Doyne Farmer (10m 53s):I mean, it did require a certain amount of bravery to do that. Given we were doing mathematics in a physics department and doing mathematics with computers with back in those days, wasn't really normally done that, set me up to go to Los Alamos because Los Alamos, you know, I happened to be reading a biography of J Robert Oppenheimer and I saw a poster for the Oppenheimer fellowships and I'm from New Mexico. So yeah, you're going back to New Mexico really appealed to me. And so I applied for a job at Los Alamos, despite my misgivings about the possibility of going for a weapons lab, thinking it was kind of a long shot. But when I went to interview, I was blown away by how exciting the intellectual environment was, how much people were thinking in a kind of free and open-ended manner. Doyne Farmer (11m 37s):There weren't any disciplinary boundaries in the theoretical division. If you did something interesting, that was good enough. It didn't have to fit in the pigeon hole. And in fact, I've made a list of my favorite and most influential dynamical systems papers. And four out of the top 10 were from Los Alamos. So it was a very natural place to go for me. And I spent 10 years there during the course of my time there at first, I was at the center for non linear studies. I was an Oppenheimer fellow. And then later I started the complex systems group there. And that's around when the Santa Fe Institute got going Michael Garfield (12m 10s):In talking about co-advising. And then also, you know, to draw the comparison to the kind of as interdisciplinary work that Los Alamos and later SFI has afforded people out at the edge of these kinds of questions. I'm reminded of the conversation I just had with James Evans about identifying unasked questions. There's a relationship in like the funding of science, the problem of not having an established advisor, this question of how do you direct attention to an unknown thing? How do you find the question? You, you're not asking the network of co-advisors or of interdisciplinary colleagues, maybe kind of like throwing a hail Mary pass here, but it seems to lead us into your work in studying economies as ecologies, where you have this evolutionary system that has no telos, but everyone is just adapting in this open-ended process to everyone else. Michael Garfield (13m 10s):And so far, as you know, David Krakauer has spoken about SFI as the mutant offspring of Los Alamos and people like Andreas Vagner have studied the rate of mutation in a sort of guided open-ended creative response to challenges. I'd love to hear you talk a little bit about the analogies between biological evolution to markets, and then how we, you know, we can actually start getting into some other research papers you sent me in which you're looking at the dynamics of marketing ecologies. Doyne Farmer (13m 40s):Okay, well, so you spend a lot of stuff there. So first of all, I would say telos is an emergent property. And I think there's almost a paradoxical catch 22, understanding that because Telus is a very useful concept because if there is a key thing that needs to be done for something to survive and propagate a Telus will emerge to do that thing. And it plays a central role in nature in a sense of Darwin and Wallace. His key insight is that if you have a system where things are competing with each other and where they have limited capabilities, so they're, they're evolving by changing their programs or their genomes or whatever, their strategies, so that they can make them a little better and survive a little better than they were before, because they're being selected for that. Doyne Farmer (14m 34s):The ones that survive better are going to propagate more because of specialization, you get an ecology of competing specialists. They may also be cooperating at times, but overall there is a kind of competition for who's going to be there, understanding how they affect each other is key to understand the system dynamics. It's key to understanding the evolution markets in particular, and having experienced starting a, an investment fund and running a quantitative investment front for eight years. You know, it's very much that kind of world traders are all looking at the system, trying to figure out who's doing what and how they can fit into it and make a little more money as a result. And they're very specialized in what they do just because they have to be. Doyne Farmer (15m 18s):And so thinking of the financial system as an evolving ecology is to my mind, the centerpiece of the view we should take. And that view up until I wrote a paper on that was largely missing though. It was pre saged actually by some of the earlier agent-based models, like the Santa Fe stock market model. But the broader idea wasn't fully articulated Michael Garfield (15m 38s):Before that that's like one of the three pillars, right? Doyne Farmer (15m 43s):Well, there are three pillars of mainstream economics you're talking about from my book. Yeah. So the three pillars of mainstream economics that identified our utility maximization, a model of beliefs like rational expectations is the one that's most common, but people are pursuing other ones and equilibrium, which is what you put those two elements together defined. I'm arguing. The complexity economics is abandoning all three pillars. So it really is a revolution. And that utility maximization reaches back to the middle of the 19th century. And we're really saying, got to throw the whole thing out, or you can use that framework. We're not saying that mainstream economics, as it exists now is wrong, per se. Doyne Farmer (16m 27s):It just, there's a lot of things that doesn't apply to very well, like complicated problems. It's not a very good model of what happens in a complex world. Michael Garfield (16m 37s):So one of the main features that comes in to complexity economics is this notion of bounded, rationality speaking, somewhat to your points about randomness, that rationality is something that's sort of relative to the history of an agent in this system, the kind of choices that they're making based on heuristics and prior experience that they've had. Right? I mean, it seems like that's like the origin of all of these different investment strategies, trading strategies, bounded rationalities seems like, well, am I completely wrong in saying that it's not so much a complete eraser of a utility maximizing things so much as it is adding a relativistic dimension to a Newtonian simplicity, right? Doyne Farmer (17m 28s):Well, it's worth parsing out the pieces of the story. So, you know, bounded rationality, well, Hey, we're all bound to be rational, right? We're not really smart. We typically don't have access to all the data. And we don't have models that allow us to use the data fully, but it's, it's really a relative thing. You know, two kids playing tic-tac-toe when I was about nine or 10, I discovered the strategy whereby Oh, can always get a tie. And then my friends discovered it and game got boring and we quit playing it because we just always had a tie. So that's a good example where as kids, we were effectively rational, we understood the problem. We were solving well enough to find the equilibrium of us all playing that same strategy that made the game boring. Doyne Farmer (18m 13s):On the other hand chest that never happens no matter how smart you are, the game remains challenging. And open-ended because we are bound to be rational when we play chess. So it's a REL relative statement. So rationality, the model of beliefs is just one part of it. Then there's a question of, do you figure out what people are going to do when confronted with an economic decision, by assuming they have a utility function that tells them what they want, and they know that all the possible events that might happen in the future and they know the probabilities of those events, and then they do a calculation to find the decision that maximizes their utility and therefore take that decision. There are circumstances where that's a reasonable thing to assume. Doyne Farmer (18m 56s):Like if you're designing an auction where you've got specialists thinking really carefully about what's going on, where the world is really constrained, you may actually know the probabilities of the events and that you may know all the possible events and you may be able to solve that and find a good answer. But in the real world, if you're talking about climate change or inequality or financial crises, these are complicated things where we don't have good models for what's happening. We may not even be able to anticipate all the things that could happen in that kind of world. The world we've evolved in people, reason differently. People use heuristics. People do things like imitate their neighbors, or pick an example out at random and just follow that. Doyne Farmer (19m 40s):And they reason a little bit about what's going on, but they reason in a very bounded way, it's just a whole different way of modeling human behavior than the way economists currently do it. And that's the way we agent based modelers typically end up modeling the world. Michael Garfield (19m 54s):So it would seem that that brings us directly to this paper that you co-authored with Shoal and unkindness. Ooh, how market ecology explains market malfunction. Right? You're doing a really interesting thing in this paper using ecological models. Like if people know the lock, the Volterra equation, you know, predator, prey cycles, you're applying something like that to, you know, a population of noise, traders, value investors and trend followers. And I'd love to hear you talk a little bit about how you're rigorously extending this analogy into this space. And then what you found in the relationships between these three sort of species or genera of market strategies and, and what it means for macro economics. Doyne Farmer (20m 43s):With this idea that trading strategies are like species and they have a colleges and that they may interact with each other like lions and zebras and grass. In this case, the food source ultimately are inefficiencies in the market ways in which things are not perfect that allow traders to make money. And who's present in the market is going to influence what those inefficiencies are and what the available niches are. So the goal is to understand why markets, why do they malfunction? Why do they do things that seem imperfect and flawed? Like why is it that prices often seem to deviate from fundamental values? Doyne Farmer (21m 28s):Why is it that market it's often can get very volatile for reasons that seem to have nothing to do with the underlying fundamentals about what's going on in the market and nothing to do with outside news, the market just gets volatile because the market is volatile right now and because of its own internal decks. And so we show how in a world where you have three strategies, all of them are bound to be rational. They're none of them has access to complete information and none of them perfect model where you let the market evolve by having the strategies that accumulate profits, cumulate wealth, which then means they have more influence on how prices get set. Doyne Farmer (22m 11s):Cause more wealth means you're making can bigger trades, which means you have more influence on how the price, this moves every day. So we just put some strategies in and let things go. And we see what happens. And we use some ideas from ecology to try and understand it. We were able to do things like compute. What's called a community matrix, which tells you whether the species are they competitive, meaning suppose you have species a and B or in this case, trading strategy, a and B if the wealth of trading strategy B goes up to the returns, the profits to trading strategy, they go up and vice versa. That would be what's called mutualism. Doyne Farmer (22m 52s):If the population of stray trading strategy B goes up and the returns of strategy, I go down and vice-versa, that's, what's called competition. And if it's as symmetric, so B goes up A's profits go up. But if A's wealth goes up, these profits go down, that's called predator prey, where a is preying on B. If you go back to the analogy of say lions and zebras, that's the way it's going to work for lions and zebras. Now we found several interesting things about our model ecology. We studied. One is that when we reached the equilibrium where the returns of all the strategies were the same, we actually saw that we had mutualistic interactions between all the strategies that is, if they're only one went up, the returns would go down. Doyne Farmer (23m 41s):But if anybody else's wealth, well-funded, the returns would go up that kind of us. But then we realized, well, that's actually maybe what you should expect at an equilibrium and an efficient place where the market's efficient in some sense. And that at the efficient place, all, all the returns to the strategies are the same. And if you deviate from that, then one of the strategies starts to have an advantage. Again, the way in which you deviate is you want the others to have more wealth than you have less wealth. It's like, no, the foxes do well when the rabbit population is high. So that was one of our insights. Another insight is that we're able to compute, what's called trophic levels for strategies that kind of tells you who eats whom and how do they lie? Doyne Farmer (24m 24s):Like with the lion zebra and grass ecology. Because if you assume that zebras eat only grass and lions eat only zebras, then the trophic levels are one for grass, two for zebras and three for lions, because they're trophic levels by definition, one higher than the thing you eat and the real world where there's more complicated diets, trophic levels can be more complicated. You can still compute them. And we're able to compute these in a financial ecology by looking at what happens when we knocked one of the trading strategies out to see how that changed the profits and saw that, you know, in the typical case, we had noise traders and at a trophic level, close to one and value investors at a trophic level or close to two trend followers that trophic level close to three, but that could change depending on the wealth of the strategies. Doyne Farmer (25m 16s):And in some cases, in fact, the trophic levels even cease to be, to find the key thing that we found is that if we want to understand why the market's malfunctioning, like why as volatility high, why are prices mispriced? Why are they straying from fundamental values? Then the wealth of each of those strategies in the ecology determine how mispriced the market is. And the system's own spontaneous dynamics can cause substantial excursions away from the equilibrium and substantial market malfunctions Michael Garfield (25m 53s):Elsewhere. In your book, you talk about leverage and how leverage causes the market to make its own news. This is an input into these imbalances. Could you go into a little bit more detail about this and you know, the, the ecology of leverage. Doyne Farmer (26m 9s):So there's really two, two kinds of effects that can cause the market to, as you said, make its own news. One is that the populations are the Wells. So different strategies changed through time and take it to places where, for example, you have de-stabilizing strategies like trend following that cause high volatility, or you can have leveraged through that and leverage as a kind of amplifier because under leverage means that investors are allowed to borrow money and buy assets with borrowed money, which might sound weird. But you know, most people end up doing that. When they buy a house, you put 20% down on your house, you just bought the house at a leverage of five to one, leverage, amplifies everything that is, if you have a leverage of five, your returns go up by a factor of five, but your volatility goes up by a factor of five. Doyne Farmer (26m 59s):But even more than that, leverage can force certain actions to be taken. If you have a leverage limit of say five and prices go down, then you're going to be forced to sell assets in order to keep your leverage at five, this kind of forest selling can de stabilize the market because it means that you can have a downward price glitch. And then if lots of participants, the domain tain, a leverage limit, they sell. So they're selling into falling markets. So they're amplifying the drops in the market, even creating instabilities, where they didn't exist before. And so you see this in several different models we've made where if you turn the leverage up, high enough things become unstable and you can get chaotic attractors and the dynamics, for example. Doyne Farmer (27m 44s):So you get spontaneous oscillations in the market. Like we have a model of what we call the Basel leverage cycle inspired partly by work of SFI, external faculty member, judge, and accomplice, and the Basel leverage cycle where, you know, we have an investment bank and we have a fundamental investor and the investment bank is borrowing money to use leverage, maintaining its leverage target, according to what Basel the Basel two agreement tells it to do and using historical volatility as an indicator of future volatility. If you turn the overall average volatility up high enough, you spontaneously get this chaotic attractor that consists of a 10 year slow rise in prices followed by an abrupt crash. Doyne Farmer (28m 27s):You know, the magnitude and amplitude vary because it's chaotic. But we see something that looks an awful lot like the great moderation and the great financial crisis just happening spontaneously from what was deemed to be prudent risk management by two representative investors, it makes its own volatility on a very long timescale on this case. So we have several different examples of models that do that, where the use of leverage creates these instabilities that can give rise to chaos or other noise amplifying phenomenon. Michael Garfield (29m 1s):I would like to draw a hypothetical link between what you just said and a conversation that I had with Jeffrey West last year on the show that has been keeping me awake at night ever since, which is his comments about the finite time singularity. And I just curious whether you think this is a valid bridge or not, he's got this insight that spills out of his work on scaling laws and the city as a social reactor. And this notion that, you know, as the city grows, that the interactions between people in the city scale greater than a linear rate. And so you end up in this accelerating crisis innovation that ultimately undermines itself because the crises start coming faster than the society can respond with innovations. Michael Garfield (29m 50s):There's a point at which you can no longer see the ball's coming at you fast enough to respond to them. And I've been thinking about this in terms of like, is there a way to escape this? And it sounds to me like what you're saying is no, because, and this is the part that I'm curious, whether you think this is valid or not. The externalities created by economic models represent a form of like off the books, leverage where, you know, if you're claiming, for example, that the ecosystem services provided by a Hector of Congolese rainforest are worth this then, because we know, like you said earlier that you can't make a complete model of the value you're buying in at a significant discount from the actual value of that rainforest. Michael Garfield (30m 38s):And that in a weird way, like maybe the more we try to swallow the spider to catch the fly with better and better modeling, we're actually creating precisely the kind of instability that you're talking about here is am I right? Doyne Farmer (30m 53s):If you're suggesting that our models become so good that they become self-defeating? Is that what you're asking about? In other words, if I have a really good model of something, then I, if I see it going somewhere, I don't want it to go that I take an action that will invalidate the model. I guess Michael Garfield (31m 8s):The simplest question would be, are externalities a form of unaccounted leverage that is making our efforts to predict this sort of inherently destabilizing? Doyne Farmer (31m 22s):I don't think leverage is quite the right analogy, but let me maybe don't let me riff on that in a different direction. We live in a world of increasing complexity. Things are changing. They're evolving all the time. That's inherently hard to model because it's a moving target and we don't know where it's going. We don't know what the, where the bulls-eye of that target is. It's the world is changing rapidly at an accelerating pace. And meanwhile, our technology for modeling it is also increasing rapidly. And the question is, do we have a parody in that arms race? Are we able to model the world well enough to keep up with the accelerating complexity of the world? And I think the jury's out, you know, in a sense the whole point of my book is we damn well better at least try. Doyne Farmer (32m 7s):And the only, the only way we're going to get there is if we have modeling technologies that take full advantage of 21st century technology, mainstream economics is using modeling ideas from the 19th and 20th centuries that don't make proper use and can't fully incorporate 21st century technology. So if we're going to survive and thrive in the 21st century and beyond, we really have to start modeling the world and the complexity of the world so that we have some guidance to help us understand what the right decisions are. And we need to come up with ways of governance that help us actually use that information, making our decisions. Doyne Farmer (32m 50s):We haven't been doing a very good job. Michael Garfield (32m 53s):Yeah. This seems like the appropriate time to bring up the point you make in your book, that in part, because of your clandestine shoe computer, the state of Nevada subsequently passed a law against using a computer to predict the outcome of a game. It's like, if that were, this whole thing would be under some sort of weird oppressive authoritarian regime. If you can imagine, you know, trying to outlaw the use of computers to predict how do they even play the stock market in Nevada. Now it's curious, this seems like an interesting time to pivot as you bring up the ratcheting complexity of the 21st century to pivot into some of the statements that you make towards the end of your book about applying this kind of thinking to problems such as climate change, how far we have to go before complexity, economics functions in the way that meteorology functions, this is maybe biting off more than we can chew in one section here, but the relationship between using complexity economics to understand our response, our adaptation to climate change at the planet scale, and then how this relates to applying this for like microeconomic interventions, Doyne Farmer (34m 9s):I'll take a crack at it and we can see where it goes. So climate change provides a good example where I think complexity economics is desperately needed. That's obviously a complex problem. There's a lot of subtle effects going on. It's not a zero sum game. We need to look around and see what solid things we can grab onto in modeling climate change. And one of the solid things that my work has grabbed onto in the last 15 years is technological change because ironically, you might think technological change predicting technological progress would be impossible because it's innovation. Maybe by definition, it's unpredictable. Doyne Farmer (34m 49s):The details of the innovations are difficult or impossible to predict. But one of the things we observed just from collecting data is that once a technology gets on a trajectory, it tends to stay on it for a long time. Moore's law being the most famous example, but there are actually lots of things follow more as like laws, solar, foldable techs, which have been on an improvement trajectory of around 10% per year, since the 1950s, meaning the cost to generate a kilowatt of solar power to electricity goes down at about 10% per year. So that actually allows us to make predictions about technological progress and compare things. And if you look at fossil fuels, they've been roughly at the same cost for more than a century prices, Bob, up and down. Doyne Farmer (35m 34s):You know, it's not that different from what it was more than a century ago. Similarly for coal, we showed this in a paper with James McNerney who was a graduate student at SFI for several years. And so part of what we predict, which is actually good news about climate change is that because renewables have been, are coming down at a steady pace, whereas fossil fuels and nuclear power are not, we can expect to see actually cheaper energy prices in the future. And we should expect the economy of its own accord to move towards renewables, just because they're cheaper. And we can assign probabilities to those events by analyzing other technologies with a model of technological progress that we've tested against those other technologies. Doyne Farmer (36m 16s):So we ended up having a very different prediction about the costs and benefits of making the transition rapidly than others, such as William Nordhaus, who won a Nobel prize in economics a few years ago have made now more generally what we would really like to be able to do is model the economy and its complexity and glory, you know, at the level of individual firms and understand how they're linked to the financial system, how they're linked to the innovation system through the record of the patent record and so on how they're linked to the occupational labor landscape so that we can think about things like the green energy transition and give good answers to questions. Doyne Farmer (36m 58s):Like what happens if we implement the green new deal? Does economy go to hell as the right suggests or does it actually work pretty well? And I think by having models that really represent the economy, as it is track things down to a fairly fine-grained level of detail, we can provide good answers to those questions. It's not a cheaper, easy enterprise to do that, but I do think it's feasible with 21st century technology and a reasonable scale effort to make models that could actually give us fairly reliable answers to questions like that. Michael Garfield (37m 32s):So you have this one paper, a rapid green energy transition is cheaper than a fossil fuel future that you coauthored with Rupert way. And penny mili, you seem to be speaking directly to this paper. Doyne Farmer (37m 43s):Yes, that's right. One of Michael Garfield (37m 45s):The interesting findings from this particular study is not only that a rapid green energy transition looks like it's an economic benefit, but that a nuclear scenario is substantially more expensive than a rapid or a slow transition. And so it's kind of funny how you've come around here in some sense to undermining the Los Alamos thing here. But I'd love to hear what exactly is going on in that scenario. And why does this research show that nuclear is not an economically viable future? Doyne Farmer (38m 21s):Sure. We do everything in that paper based on a principle that you can, can accept or deny, which is that we just make extrapolations based on past history. Now, the paper that that paper is based on, you know, we, we assembled a of 50 different technologies and look at histories through time. And we showed that actually past is indicative of the future. If something has been coming down, it tends to keep coming down that hasn't been coming now, it tends to not come down ever, or it fluctuates around a bit, but doesn't do much. Nuclear is a good example. You know, nuclear power and solar power came into being at almost the same time in the late 1950s. And since then, solar photovoltaic energy has come down by a factor of about 5,000 nuclear costs, about three times, as much as it did then per kilowatt. Doyne Farmer (39m 9s):You know, you can grumble that's because they put all those safety restrictions on nuclear power plants, maybe true, but there was no other forest bringing it down, certainly not by a factor of 5,000. And you know, we've looked now at data from lots of different countries, France, South Korea, South Korea. They've come down a little bit like at 1% per year, but that's not 10% per year. It's just a matter of what history tells us about technological change. There are, we believe some good reasons for these differences, but they're not well understood at this point. Michael Garfield (39m 41s):Yeah, just a moment ago, you touched on talking about this real granular modeling of the economy, looking at the relationships between firms and, and it calls to mind a paper. I just saw coauthored by Ricardo Hausmann, where he's using directed networks to examine the relationship between simple and complex exports and looking at like a different nations and, and how the economic relationships between different nations steer, the evolution of technology by providing a map of how these different nations are able to build on what is already there. Michael Garfield (40m 22s):And then you can kind of predict where the next combinations of things are going to be both in terms of the technological sector, what they're going to look like, and then also where they're going to happen. And so this is, this seems like a very different application of these kinds of trophic network models, but it seems like a really exciting one and one that in spite of your historical aversion to weapons development, I just have to ask about these kinds of tools where you, where you sit on all of this, if, if it's not too presumptuous. Doyne Farmer (40m 58s):No. So I think that's a V. So the paper you mentioned by Naval Clery and Ricardo Hausmann, it's a great paper. One of the building blocks in a line of research that Ricard has been pursuing for a long time. And it's just showing once again, that if you think about the process of economic development from a complex systems point of view, you're led to models with a lot of predictive value in particular economic growth follows standard developmental patterns that as you say, depend on things like the capabilities that countries can bring to bear, to make the products that they make and what they need to add to make new. It Michael Garfield (41m 34s):Just sort of folds into the sort of larger question you've already addressed about the arms race between different people, modeling the world, and then leveraging those models in competition. And so on. Doyne Farmer (41m 47s):Maybe I don't quite understand your question. Ricardo makes a predictive model about development. If countries start to use that model, will that invalidate the model? I doubt it. I think, I think the model actually can survive. Having people use it and it will just lead to better development. It should allow countries to develop faster because they're doing their development. It actually gives insight into the right way for a country to develop in order to make rapid progress, bring wealth and prosperity to their people sooner, rather than later, Michael Garfield (42m 20s):I guess this sort of ties into one of the three points in the final chapter of your book. We've already addressed one, which is a transition to a sustainable economy, at least an economy built on sustainable energy and resources. Another one of the points is about creating a world of equal opportunity yet elsewhere. You and many other people working in complexity economics have pointed out that there are sort of natural structural inequalities that emerge from this. When I had Brian Arthur on the show, you know, he gave an argument from scaling laws for universal basic income saying that, you know, at some point the system becomes large enough that it actually has to pump resources into its own capillaries, similar to how most ants in a large colony are effectively doing nothing. Michael Garfield (43m 12s):And any given time, you have to actively incense this kind of opportunity. I wonder to what extent the proliferation and refinement of predictive models do not themselves just sort of become a tool whereby existing inequality can be magnified by people capable of acting on these models. Doyne Farmer (43m 35s):Let me maybe rephrase your question. If the people who get access to predictive models are the rich can't. They then use that to manipulate the world, to make themselves even richer and perpetuate inequality. And I think that's probably true, particularly if they use them to do things like manipulate public opinion and so on. As I think we see with things like Fox news. On the other hand, if we can show conclusively that decreasing inequality actually is good for the overall growth of the economy, decision-makers will be incentivized to act, to take policies into account that decrease inequality. And as you said, a moment ago, it's true that there are intrinsic forces that create inequality. Doyne Farmer (44m 18s):If we understand those forces, we can also understand the degree to which those forces act, depending on the policies that we put in place. We have a range of policy measures, you know, minimum wage, universal income, traditional welfare system, income tax, as we play with those levers, how does that change the landscape? How does that affect the economy? So you, you potentially can, can study all those options and just see which one gives you better outcomes and hope that democracy will push you in the direction of those outcomes. Michael Garfield (44m 52s):To the point of shaping incentive landscapes. This speaks to a question that we got internally from, from Kaitlyn McShea, which was about the project that we started talking about, the, the desire to try and make enough money to bounce out of the system fund your own research through, through your gaming of the system. Her question was about your thoughts on the problematic system of incentives for scientific research and how it takes a lot of effort to get funded such that you end up having to literally game the system as you did, in order to actually ask blue sky fundamental questions elsewhere. Michael Garfield (45m 38s):I've seen Murray, Gell-Mann speak to this about skewed incentives and society actively punishing people involved in a synthetic or translational function. This is an essential role in a network ecology, and yet it seems actively disincented no, it's true. So I'm, I'm curious how you see this problem and what if any solution you see for it? Doyne Farmer (46m 4s):It's certainly true that the disciplinary silos that we have created have created a strange system where it's relatively easy to fund research that is making incremental steps around the questions that each of the disciplinary silos are focused on. But there are chasms that exist between these silos and exploring what exists in those chasms is very hard to do because there is no institution for funding work that investigates those questions. And in fact, they're active disincentives because people inside the silos want to keep all the money and they want to maximize the money inside their silo, and they have allegiance to the silo and they have incentives to perpetuate themselves within it. Doyne Farmer (46m 51s):So they're big, big disincentives for more interdisciplinary work. And for, just for any work that doesn't fall inside. One of the silos, it's unfortunate, it's bad for society. And I'm just speaking in somebody who's always found the question I want to ask exist in those chasms, because those are the places where we don't know things and the best questions are about the things we know the least about. How can we change that? Well, SFI has made a step towards changing that just by existing people, recognizing the problem and funding it out, may mostly outside of the mainstream, the NSF for awhile. And maybe they're still doing this. I'm not getting it funding anymore. So I don't know that a program whereby a certain amount of money was allocated that required investigators from different disciplines. Doyne Farmer (47m 39s):You had to have at least two PIs, and they had to be from distinctly different disciplines in order to even have a shot at getting funded. That was a revolution because it gave a leg up to us, interdisciplinary people. I got several NSF projects funded as a result of that, that never would have gotten funded without that. One could hope that somewhere in the future, we have a real discipline of complex systems. Arizona state is trying to create such a discipline. Now, university of Chalmers, and you have to more in Sweden has been doing this for some time. And if that becomes more widespread, then we may start to have money allocated where you actually get credit for the fact that you've proposed a question. Doyne Farmer (48m 21s):That's not a standard question. That's really different than the questions other people want to answer, and that it doesn't land inside of a disciplinary silo. But until that happens, I think we're relying on little tweaks here and there, like the NSF program. Michael Garfield (48m 37s):It seems like a decent time to dip into some of the questions that our Twitter audience was eager to ask you. Fabi on dabble lender would like to know what are in your view, the three best and three worst ideas in economics. Maybe we've already spoken to some of this. Doyne Farmer (48m 57s):Gosh, that's, that's a question that requires more reflection than I can probably do on the fly. I can't say I'm going to give the definitive list of it's my definitive list of the three best in three words that would require some reflection, but traditional economics works pretty well for things like designing an auction. I really liked the model that you mentioned that Ricardo just made, because I assume when we talk about economics, we're talking about not just mainstream, but complexity, economics, you know, the whole picture that's emerged of the way financial markets really work from the complexity economics point of view was a major accomplishment. The three worst, the idea that we are all rational, selfish, utility maximizers has caused a lot of harm in economics by encouraging things like neo-liberalism that suggest that laissez-faire capitalism is just the right way to go and will create good outcomes for the world. Doyne Farmer (49m 53s):The idea that you can model climate change with a simple representative macro model with unrealistic mitigation and damage functions is another seriously bad idea. I don't know what my, what my third candidate would be. Michael Garfield (50m 10s):Okay. I mentioned earlier you have three points about the benefits of complexity economics in the final chapter of your book. And one of them we haven't touched on yet. And so it just seems like practicing due diligence to invite you to talk about your vision for the central bank of the future, how you see these practices in place as competitive evolutionary forces, drive them into the mainstream of the practice of economics and finance. And, you know, after this transition, this transformation in the way that we think about and practice money and value, what do you see that actually looking like what is going on inside a central bank in 2050? Doyne Farmer (50m 57s):So I think I envisioned a central bank that's dramatically more technologically sophisticated than current central banks, where banks collect data about the economy in real time, at a fine grain level and have models that simulate the economy at that level and allow them to think about the policies that are enacting and how they will affect the future. A good example. That's doable right now with things we know how to do is understanding systemic risk in the financial system goes back to the discussion we had about leverage and vision. This financial system is a multi-layer network where the nodes are the key financial institutions, big banks, and the interconnections are their interactions. Doyne Farmer (51m 40s):So money they've lent to each other common portfolio holdings being two most obvious examples. Every time one of those banks does something, it affects the other ones. If a bank sells an asset, the presses, the price of that asset, which affects every other bank that holds the same asset. Similarly, when banks default on a loan, for example, then you're going to get a cascading failure mode where one bank defaulting causes another bank to the fault as they all start trying to call in their loans and potentially not paying them back and these different channels of contagion interact with each other. We, and some others have papers where we've shown how one can really very effectively model these things. Doyne Farmer (52m 21s):You can really model the way the contagion cascades around the economy and much the way that you can model how the COVID epidemic will cascade. And not that those models will be perfect, but they will really allow central banks to think in a fairly quantitative manner about resilience and stability of the financial system. When new changes come in, like we've been doing this in the early part of the millennium and you see a new species like mortgage backed security trading coming in, then you can ask, is this destabilizing the financial ecology? Ultimately what I'm saying is central bank should be able to track the financial ecology, just the way a, you know, jungle ecologists might measure the abundance of species in the jungle and track that ecology and think about their interactions in a similar way. Doyne Farmer (53m 12s):Central banks can do that and we know how to do it. Now. It's just a question of throwing enough effort at it and, and making sure that banks are really empowered to collect all that data. In real time, they could have been presenting results to key decision makers in 2005 saying guys that financial systems headed for a bad place. I think it was quite apparent. And 2005 or six, certainly that, you know, leverage was out of control. You could see that if a little glitch in housing prices would cause the whole thing to collapse. And, and you could have seen that in the models. Hypothetically, in my book, I opened with a story about the fed. In 2006, they asked their best model what's going to happen. Doyne Farmer (53m 53s):If housing prices dropped by 20%, it said not much. So that model didn't any way capture the fine grade ecology of the financial system as it really exists. Michael Garfield (54m 3s):That's an interesting point about the future practice of economics, which in the same way that science fiction is always just talking about present day issues. I agree with this, but it's just worth pointing out the meadow, which is that it seems each of us have a stake in the future, looking like our strategy wins and that this is a strategy that looks very much like the kind of interdisciplinary work going on. And I know at Oxford and SFI and Los Alamos, where you talk about there being a teams within each bank that are specializing at different layers of granularity for large firms, small businesses, the entire financial system household level. Michael Garfield (54m 47s):And this looks a lot like the way that David Kenney and Tyler Millhouse have talked about the disciplines of science emerging out of different layers of fine graining. And so it's perhaps a Testament to the empirical validity that this is the natural response. You start to see a fractal structure in the way that we actually study these flows. Doyne Farmer (55m 11s):It's certainly true that almost by definition people, advocate for the things they believe in, I'm going to advocate for complexity economics. And I do that because I think it's the right thing to do. The only thing I can say there is, it's a bit different in that if I just decided to play ball with a mainstream, then I would probably be much better positioned for being part of it and receiving the accolades that it Accords to itself rather than being the outsider challenging them, which is not as profitable a role at least in the short term, but it's just what I believe in. So I've got to do it. And that's what I think is the right thing to do all your second point. It's certainly true that you know what the central bank of the future, I imagine people would be specialized. Doyne Farmer (55m 55s):You need teams of people that interact with each other, where different members of the team have very different kinds of expertise. Because if you want to understand households, you have to really gather data on households and firms is a different story. And we need specialists in both of those. And we need models that can really fully incorporate the richly textured information and differences between those parts of the economy and ways of checking to see whether the models that we make for those parts are really accurately representing what the economy does. It's reminiscent actually heard Simon had his theory of the firm and arguing why you get hierarchies and firms. You get hierarchies because of information flows and the need for local information processing. Doyne Farmer (56m 39s):Versus since we aren't rational, not everybody can do everything perfectly. So you have to specialize domains of competence. So we do need disciplinary things. We do need specialization at the same time, we need more generalists to cut across and cross-fertilize things. So we need both of those at once. The system, as it's set up has tended to favor the specialists over the generalist. And as part of what SFI has been about changing is to facilitate those interdisciplinary dialogues by people who strive to be generalists. Michael Garfield (57m 10s):So to that point of encouraging the diversity of a given ecosystem, I guess maybe the last question I have for you is completely off the rails as far as any of the work that I've seen of yours. But I know that this is a, an area of research for SFI and of modest interest. I would say, how do you understand what's going on in the space of cryptocurrencies and its relationship to the incumbent economy as it is today? Because, you know, obviously it doesn't seem like you have any doubt that central banks will persist and you know, your work as we've already discussed in this episode makes the case that people that are just following other people's trades as seems to be largely the case in the cryptocurrency markets is for sure contributing to its enormous volatility. Michael Garfield (58m 4s):It's not just this small market cap of these markets. I mean, it seems like perhaps a small amount of insanity is actually good for the system in the sense that small quantity of poison has medicine. But I'm just curious how you, how you see the relationship between the, in some cases, stifling and counterfactual, sanity of the incumbent system and this sort of creative insanity of this next generation of like decentralized finance and so on Doyne Farmer (58m 35s):Cryptocurrencies are fascinating. I don't think it's completely clear where that's going so far. Most of the cryptocurrencies don't do a very good job of regulating supply and demand. And so, hence they've been hugely volatile and they're not backed by a bigger entity. I mean, one of the nice things about a dollar is it is backed by the earning power of the U S taxpayer. So the whole economy sits behind it, which makes you think it's not going to just disappear or evaporate overnight. Bitcoin is a fascinating example of a self-organized phenomena that plays into some peculiar mixture of illegal activity and the quirks of human psychology. You, it has led to some very interesting technological improvements like blockchains, which have uses that go far beyond cryptocurrencies and potentially could be used by governments in lots of other kinds of applications where you want to certify the authenticity of something in a sort of distributed holographic way. Doyne Farmer (59m 34s):So going to be very interesting to see where that goes. It's not obvious to me, whether in 20 years we'll look back on, Oh, this is a cryptocurrency or a, was it that funny, or will cryptocurrencies really come to play a major role in global finance? I'm sort of betting on the former, but I think they may also evolve. So cryptocurrencies are either picked up by governments and deployed, I mean, blockchain and some of the other technologies that are used in cryptocurrencies will be picked up. So they're digital currencies for nation States or other entities, but we'll see Michael Garfield (1h 0m 13s):Possibly a prerequisite technology for the kind of granular economic surveillance required of this hypothetical future central bank. Doyne Farmer (1h 0m 22s):Well, I'm not sure. I mean, you know, the thing is right now, central banks could do a lot of things. Most of them don't do, some of them are starting to do it, but like, you know, in Chile every time somebody swipes a zero Stripe, it gets sent to the central bank and they know who at least one of the counterparties work, it says some customer bought something in the store or, you know, two companies exchange an invoice or receipt that also gets sent to the central bank. So they're able to really track the flows in the economy in a much more detailed and real-time manner than we do. And it's just a fairly trivial change in the value added tax laws and you know, a little bit of extra technology, other countries like in the UK, they leave out key bits of information. Doyne Farmer (1h 1m 8s):So you can't do that. They have a value added tax and are keeping records, but they just don't keep a sufficient record. So I think there are a lot of areas where even without blockchains or anything fancy like that central banks could be tracking a lot of stuff that they don't track at this point in time. Michael Garfield (1h 1m 21s):Well, this has been fascinating. Thank you, Dwayne. Just as a parting shot, I guess, what of importance do you feel that we we've left on the answered? What stone have we left unturned that you feel like is worth people thinking about in this area? Doyne Farmer (1h 1m 39s):I don't know. I have been sufficiently occupied trying to answer these questions that I have. I'm just reflecting back there's anything in particular we haven't discussed. Michael Garfield (1h 1m 49s):What's the most fruitful area of unanswered inquiry for you right now, looking forward into, you know, future research projects? Doyne Farmer (1h 1m 58s):Well, I think at this point, actually, I'm at a point where I'm bringing a lot of different things to fruition rather than starting new new directions. And I think we've covered most of those. Excellent. I mean, I could comment on something else. I don't know if this is relevant for SFI talk, but I have decided that the only real way to demonstrate complexity economics is the right way to go in a definitive way is to actually do it commercially. That's the only way I think to get funding on the scale that's needed. It should be able to show that if done well, the complexity economic methods can be more effective at predicting things. So that's my next big thing. Doyne Farmer (1h 2m 39s):I started a company called macrocosm and we're in the process of refining a business plan and, and we'll be in the process of raising money probably within six months. That's exciting and new direction. Awesome. Well, everybody, the complexity economics revolution should be out by when it'll be out a year from when I, my publisher says, gives me the green light that it's really done. I hope that will happen within about three months. I've been eternally optimistic and made consistently bad forecasts about that question. Well, in the meantime, folks, you can find some of his work in SFI, press complexity, economics, volume books have been written about. Doyne Farmer (1h 3m 23s):You will link to a lot of this stuff, as well as some of the talks that you've given at SFI in the show notes. Thank you Darren, for taking the time. It's been a pleasure. Michael Garfield (1h 3m 34s):Thank you for listening.

Thanks and enjoy!Jonas Dalege (0s): People want to reduce inconsistency and dissonance in their own belief system, but they also want to reduce dissonance at the social level. And of course, people can differ than in how important they judge these different levels. So for some people that might be more important. Okay. That's their own belief system is very consistent. Other people will be a bit more inclined to agree with the social network and so on. And what I think is also very interesting about this is that there's kind of indications that what happens in a single humans mind is actually quite similar to what happens in a group of humans.So for example, if a group has kind of an inclined leaning toward a given issue, let's say it's about abortion. And most of the individuals in the group are pro choice. And then they discuss about this. And then after discussing this, people will actually move to being even more pro-choice at the same time, when you ask people to think about the attitudes, the can kind of the same happens. So if I ask someone who is, let's say moderately, pro-choice I think a bit about your attitude. Then after a few minutes, this person will actually move a bit more towards the extremeMichael Garfield (1m 25s): Human relationships are often described in the language of chemistry. Does that make the beliefs and attitudes of individuals, a kind of physics? It is at least a fascinating Avenue of inquiry. In particular, the field of statistical mechanics offers potent tools for understanding how exactly people form their views and change their minds. From this perspective, everyone is a dynamic network of opinions and values in a tense and ever-changing balance both with others and ourselves.The chemistry of social life then arises from multi-level interactions in our noisy minds and how they influence each other. Welcome to complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks, to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. In this conversation, we speak with SFI post-doc Yonas.about how his research uses physics models to understand the emergence of higher level behaviors from lower-level behaviors, both within and between people. We discuss the role of entropy in the formation of individual beliefs, statistical approaches to the study of ambivalence and cognitive dissonance, the wisdom and challenge of tolerating ambiguity and the social consequences when we try to minimize internal conflict.

Thank you for listening.  Jonas the Lega. It's a pleasure to have you on complexity podcast.  Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. So I like to start these conversations by humanizing the scientist a little bit here, talking about how you got into your work and what animated or inspired the kinds of questions that you're interested in asking in your research. So give us a little bit of a backstory on your entry into science. Jonas Dalege (3m 46s): Yeah, sure. I kind of was always very interested in people's beliefs. I know sometimes people are quite a mystery to me and some of the beliefs people have, and it might also sound a bit like a cliche, but also being a German kind of inspired me our history and how people can have these extremely horrible beliefs and then act on them. So that is one of the great mysteries that are in our world. I don't come from a academic background and not from an academic family. So I didn't really know what science was like, but at some point I kind of decide, okay, I'm really interested in this. I should just study psychology. And that then was what I did. And then I got deeper into these questions. How do people's beliefs form, how also form extreme beliefs. And then during my PhD, I also discovered complexity science aspects to the study of beliefs that we then let me to the research that I'm currently doing, that I also did during my PhD, which is based mostly on the idea that we can understand how beliefs form and change through studying them as networks. Michael Garfield (4m 47s): I feel like there were a lot of core ideas that we need to define in order to really get into the meat of your work. And I'm one of those would just be the way that you understand attitudes in the first place and beliefs and how you're defining those things formally in a way that's somewhat different from the sort of common use of those terms, not entirely, but you're making some nuanced distinctions here that I think are key to understanding how you actually go about creating models for this stuff.Jonas Dalege (5m 21s): The definition of attitudes, the general definition that I use in my, in my work that is mostly comes from very classic ideas in mostly social psychology and attitudes, and generally just liking or disliking of an editor object, which can basically be anything. It can be a person, an idea, a product and so on. This is more like this global evaluation, but you also have these more nuanced elements of attitudes, which generally come in the form of beliefs. So for example, if you think of a person that you really like, you might think about the person, this person is a very, very intelligent person, fun to talk to and honest and so on.  But of course there's also more feelings involved in his attitude. So do you really like this person? You have sympathy to what this person, and then there's also of course, behaviors involved. So for example, you enjoy spending time with this person. And this is one of the classic ideas in social psychology that extrudes consists of these three different components of attitudes. And then what my research most focused on is on the interactions between these different elements. Because now it's not the thing that you, you basically just have all these different beliefs, feelings, and behaviors in isolation, but they all influence each other, having one positive belief about the person we're making more likelier to other positive beliefs. Michael Garfield (6m 36s): We're definitely going to get to that, the network nature of this stuff. But before we do, I think one of the key points to stress in this discussion is the fact that you're bringing in terms and models from statistical mechanics and using those to analyze this. So I think it's worth assuming zero knowledge on the part of our listeners, which is probably deeply unfair, but nonetheless building our ladder at the ground. Let's talk about what it is that you mean when you say attitude and entropy and the different kinds of entropy that figure into this in terms of the way that you just described it about these micro beliefs, leading to a person's attitude about something. That's really key.Jonas Dalege (7m 19s): Exactly. So as you said, the important point here is that there's basically two levels. And I mean, of course it's a, it's a bit of a simplification because also beliefs can also be a bit more nuanced, more global, but for the second simplicity, we treated now mostly as having two levels. So having these more fine rent beliefs, and then this general attitude, and I think the framework or statistical mechanics then lends very well to this because this is really what I think is statistical. My case is an essence about, about connecting these lower level properties to higher level emerging properties. And then of course also entropy comes into play. And that is often also one critique I get on my work because people think, okay, entropy that comes from, from physics, from Nesser science, what does it have to do with psychology? But the interesting thing about entropy is that it's a statistical concept. So in this sense, it might be, there's a place also very well to attitudes because it's just much easier actually to have a very inconsistent and unclear attitude. Because I mean, when you think again about the person and there's many different ways, you can be ambivalent about the person, but just basically one way to feel very positive about this person so that you have all these positive beliefs and positive feelings. And so on. This then directly relates to Boltzmann entropy, which is basically that how many of these micro properties can lead to this global emerging pattern.  Michael Garfield (8m 38s): A couple of examples that you give in this paper, this is the one that you coauthored with Borsune Von Hariveld and VanderMoss in psychological inquiry, the attitudinal entropy framework, as a general theory of individual attitudes. You give a couple of examples. One I like is the slot machine. There's a lot of ways to lose. There's only a few ways you can get three or four or five in a row. And then another one is a little bit more on the psychological end is about snakes, which I think given the amount of work on the formation of political opinions that you and colleagues have done at SFI might be a little on the nose, but there are many, many different reasons to like, or not like someone. And yet you end up voting for a given candidate along with a lot of people with whom you disagree on most points, but this is all kind of assuming that all of these different beliefs are uncorrelated. And as you already said, it's not that case. You're not equally likely to have two different beliefs about a person. This is where the network model comes in and the way that all of these different beliefs influence one another enters the picture. So can you talk a little bit about that and how you're applying network models to these sort of ecologies of belief.Jonas Dalege (9m 55s): It's really based on this basic idea that you don't form these beliefs in isolation. When you, for example, you observe a person to act in an honest manner. It's not just the case that you just kind of know this and gonna save it up in your mind and say, "Oh yeah, this person's honest." And of course it primes you to also think about this person other ways. So for example, you will assume, I suppose, this person is probably also caring. It's a nice person. And so on. You might also infer that this person is intelligent and then there's implies that all these different beliefs influences others, but also beliefs each other in different amounts.For example, judging someone who's honest will have a high impact on judging. This person is caring, but a lesser impact on judging this person that's intelligent. So I think this is really why I think that applying network analysis to attitudes makes a lot of sense because these beliefs form a network and the connections between beliefs are also not trivial. So I think we can actually learn quite a bit from studying attitudes as networks and can, for example, see which belief is most central to a person's belief system, which can also give to answer information, okay, how might these beliefs be checkedMichael Garfield (10m 58s): In this paper that you and your coauthors use, The Icing Model, which I think most fans of complex systems research know from inquiry into the alignment of magnetic particles, but here you're doing something a little different with it. And I'd like to link that to a statement that we kind of glossed on the way here, which is what it is that a person's brain is doing with inconsistent beliefs and how the macro state of a person's attitude is more or less unstable due to inconsistencies in the micro States of their beliefs. There's a trend or a bias in us towards seeking consistency in the same way that, you know, you put two magnetic North ends together and you know, the magnets flip, they reorient according to the influence, that's a real, simple, naive explanation of this. And I'd love to hear you go into a little more depth about the way that the icing model is being used in this and the way that you might consider a person's cognition as seeking the lower entropy macro state, if you will.Jonas Dalege (12m 9s): Yep. Yep. And upon point to add to this is that it would also depend on the circumstances how much you are motivated to seek this consistency. So for example, if the attitudes or the belief system is very important to you, for example, you have to make a decision based on this. You have to decide between the houses you want to buy. Then you are very motivated to arrive at a decision and arriving at this decision will be much easier if you have this somewhat consistent attitude. And on the other hand, if you don't really care about a given topic, maybe you are, for example, if you are not interested in politics at all, then you will probably be fine with having inconsistent attitudes towards given petitions.We use this icing model to autumn model, these differences in the icing model in general, and Cisco physics, you have this idea of temperature, which actually will influence how strongest drive towards consistency is. So basically if you really care about something, this cannot be modeled using the Icing model with having a low temperature attitude, which will then go to a more extreme attitude. But if you don't really care, you come all this go for high temperature attitudes, which then is a bit more all over the place and will also likely not have that much impact, for example, on your behavior. Also relating to this there's pretty cool research actually by Dan Simon of the university of Southern California, where he gives people a few facts about the legal case. And then the first thing that people don't know that these effects are related and they just read them. And then at some point they learn, okay, this is about the legal case. And you have to decide whether the person is guilty or not. And then all these different facts of, for example, that this person was seen at the scene of the crime and that maybe it was a robbery or something, and that this person has financial problems. These different statements then become correlated in people's minds if they belong to the same case, which really underlines the point that you want to come to a decision, all the different aspects of the system become dependent on each other.Michael Garfield (14m 6s): This is a, maybe a bit of a Baroque constellation here. I'm going to try to put together, but it's listening to you speak about all this stuff, just to take a dip out for a moment of this paper and propose some links to other work. I'm reminded of Emory university human development, professor James Fowler, who wrote a book in 1981 called Stages of Faith, where he was looking at child and adult psychological development, and how as a person learns to take the structures of their mind as objects as they grow older and wiser, he basically looked at this massive survey of interviews and survey information, and he basically described wisdom as the tolerance for ambiguity.And if you think about development in terms of moving the subject of one's identity into the position of an object, you learn to take your beliefs as objects and manipulate them through metacognition. These become less imminent and less important to you. You gain distance from them. And so you're allowed to remain in a position of unknowing about them. And so to link that back into SFI research, I'm reminded of the conversation I had with Tim Koehler and Martin Scheffer about climate change as a collective action problem and how this is something that is so abstract to many, many people has been abstracted, even in cases where the extreme weather events are urgent, palpable and immediate.It's really unclear how we would all align in a position that results in concerted action towards one strategy or one outcome over another. It's interesting because what determines the stakes and what determines therefore, the urgency that a person feels to settle into one state or another in this model seems sometimes to have to do with wisdom and maturity and sometimes to do with ignorance and or misaligned incentives.So I don't know what your thoughts are on all of that, but it just seemed worth mentioning that these are two cases where it seems like your model is very easily applied, but they kind of point in different directions.Jonas Dalege (16m 32s): This quote, what was it? "A wisdom is the tolerance of ambiguity." I think that's very good quote, and I think that's also a problem. I think there's this general tendency. I think it's, it's very human thing to do. It might almost be automatic to reduce ambiguity and arrive at a more simple representation than what the word actually is. It's also that we have a lot of pressure, I think, in, in our society that you should have very clear opinions. It's often kind of consider that a bad sign. If you say, "Oh, I don't know."I mean, for many, many topics, your answer actually should be. "Yeah, I don't really know."  I mean, that's also what drives science acknowledging that for the most part, we just don't know. And I think people in general don't really like acknowledging this, but yeah, I think it often really helps then also going through issues like climate change it's portrayed and of course rightfully it as a very important issue, but this will also then motivate people to reduce the ambiguity in their belief system even more. And this will also then induce resistance actually so that some people will just reduce a bigger team by thinking, okay, climate change is just not real.And so I think it can often cause problems if we make a issue too important, which of course, it's a bit of a conundrum there because I mean, it's, it is very important, but there's a fine line that you have to walk there.Michael Garfield (17m 48s): Certainly as with so many in the complex systems world, it seems like we're really seeking is a kind of Aristotelian golden mean between two virtues that are horribly destructive if taken to the extreme. And in that sense, another piece I'd love to link to your work is the piece that as a researchers, Vicky Yang, Tamara vendor dose, and Henrik Olson just published in PLS one today, falling through the cracks. Jonas Dalege: I didn't know that. Michael Garfield: Yeah. Modeling the formation of social category boundaries. So like what you and your coauthors are saying in this piece is that it's psychologically uncomfortable to remain in this sort of gaseous state about your convictions and that this is not just true at the individual level, but this is true when it comes to the formation of identity. And therefore it's a dynamic that makes for these overly simple voting blocks and political categories and categories of identity where moderates and independence and non-binary gendered individuals. And so on just sort of disappear. I'm curious, based on this model of yours, what hope you think we have for creating a space where more nuance and more categories is not such a gruesome thing to entertain, is not such a difficult thing to actually hold. This is where we can get into some of the other implications and predictions of your model about what happens when we try to manipulate the weights and a network model of attitudes. Jonas Dalege (19m 33s): First of all, I think it's important to actually acknowledge that, that it's quite a natural drive for humans to make complex issues more simple, but also by acknowledging this, I think this also then leads us to realize that we shouldn't make this even more pronounced, right? So for example, having a two party system where people actually even have to register with a party, you will just fuel this natural tendency. You already have to reduce your inconsistency to be able to vote. No political party or no political candidate will exactly be what you want. So there must also be already some reduction of this inconsistency there, but then having people be reminded all the time. Okay. Yeah. You're either a Democrat or Republican really must make this much more pronounced, right? So that's basically the whole time you will be even more, less tolerant of this complexity. So I think that would be important to acknowledge this and then derive strategies, how we can actually deal with this. And I think it's it's of course not as easy to just move from a two party system to a multi party system, but trying to reduce this identification would I think help already, at least a bit,Michael Garfield (20m 40s): One of the insights that spills out of this model has to do with why it is and you of hinted at this just a moment ago, why it is that it is so incredibly difficult to persuade people with evidence and why attempts to persuade people so often backfire. And so, you know, I'd love to ground this in something that hopefully helps people navigate their personal relationships, their organizational bureaucracy is the work that they do as lobbyists and activists. Why is this happening, that our persuasion so often backfires? And then what can we do about that? Jonas Dalege (21m 26s): Pretty direct implication of our model is that what basically happens, if you have a discussion with a person you don't agree with, there's probably two things going on. Let's assume this person will listen to you. So it's not you, you don't hate each other, but you might be colleagues or friends that you just have different opinions talking this. This will have basically two consequences. So first of all, you will communicate some information you have to this other person. And this other person will also, at least to some extent will receive this information. But what will also happen is that because of this conversation, the other person will of course direct attention to the issue.And this in our model directly leads you to your beliefs, becoming more correlated and going to more extremes. So what then can happen is even if this person hears the information from your side, it might actually be that increase in attention and importance will actually move this person further away from you because this person's existing beliefs become more correlated and therefore this person becomes more extreme in the other direction. And so this already is kind of the default thing, what will happen. But again, they're evaluating this, that this will happen already implies. You don't want to accelerate this.And I think for example, if you would tell a person that basically, well, you're wrong, this will basically just lead this person to become even more entrenched in his or her former beliefs. And so basically having an open mind and signaling, yeah, I have an open mind also for what would you think would probably reduce this tendency at least somewhat, and then maybe you can actually really have a good discussion and actually exchange information instead of just entrenching your beliefs even more,Michael Garfield (23m 2s): Again, to link this to some other SFI research I'm reminded of Simon Dayo, his presentation on explosive proofs of mathematical truths, rather than looking at a mathematical proof as a linear, if then series of arguments that if you map it as a network, that you can actually kick a lot of the legs out from under that table without the table falling over. One of the predictions that you just spoke to in this model is that if you can reduce the dependence parameter of a network, that's actually what allows for a less stable, a less resistant attitude.And so, you know, I'm thinking about this in terms of, you know, a tried and true approach to formal debate, which is again, not to attack the resolution itself, not to attack the macro state and not to attack the components of it that are the most stable, but to look for little ways to erode and undercut this piece by piece and thereby differentiating for your debate opponent in the way that, you know, Simon talks about this, that these are not all sort of logically consequential from one another.And you make this distinction in, in, in this paper also that there's a difference between a discreet shift in a person's attitude and a continuous shift. You don't necessarily have to change a person's mind entirely. You can just move them a little closer to the center of the argument. Does this analogy hold?Jonas Dalege (24m 40s): Yeah, I think so. But of course also it relates again, to what extent this attitude is then very important to this person because having these discrete shifts happening that is something that's much more likely to happen if it's very important and this more continuous shift, it's more likely if the person is not too involved in this issue. So basically having debates strategy where you're at at the same time, don't make this argument too involved, but also getting your argument across will probably be the most effective. But of course, it's also, it's also very difficult to actually do that,Michael Garfield (25m 11s): Even though I feel like you've touched on this already. I'd like to specifically highlight ambivalence and cognitive dissonance. And in particular you differentiate between attitudinal ambivalence and felt ambivalence. And also, I, I know, so, so many people in the modern world that are suffering from really profound cognitive dissonance at this time. So yeah, just, I think, you know, just again, grounding your model and its predictions and implications in something that helps people get a better sense for why it is that this is such a, an epidemic experience in this time.I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Is it simply the fact that we are exposed to so many different perspectives in a global social networks or what is going on and what, if any bomb can we apply to these wounds that isn't just about entrenching ourselves in some sort of retrogressive future shock kind of move into these counterfactual positions, just to feel a little bit more united within ourselves?Jonas Dalege (26m 22s): I, I would think that it might be actually two reasons. Of course we have much more information about all different things than we used to have, but at the same time, especially in the political arena, it's also, there's this much, much more pressure actually to be involved in this with the last president of the U S constantly being on Twitter. I mean, it's people getting reminded all the time. Okay. There's on the one side, people who really, really liked this president, but they also remind of this constantly. And then there were other people who really disliked this president and they were also constantly reminded of this.And so at the same time, you have this extreme flow of information. And on the other hand, you also kind of all the time pressured to make up your mind. And I think this is kind of a toxic combination because then you would just kind of have to really simplify all the information you get. And instead of just accepting, okay, there's just a lot of different things going on. And for some things I just don't know.  Actually, after the election of 2016, Stephen called Bayer, actually put this very well, how we should deal with it. And he said something like informed, yes, but not in it all the time. And I think this is something that we should actually approach these issues because in the last years, I think everyone was basically in it all the time and it's just too much. And I think this would actually reduce the likelihood that people will also accept with different our opinions. And that is fine. But I also want to stress that I think polarization, for example, is not always a bad thing. So for example, the turnout in the last election was the highest turnout in, I think, 60 years or so. And I think their polarization actually had a very positive impact, but then of course we don't want people hating other people that disagree with them.Disagreeing is great and fine, but hate of course is not the way to go. Michael Garfield (28m 3s): You've just reminded me of a couple different things. One of which is a paper I love bringing up whenever people are talking about world peace, which is a paper David Krakauer and Jessica Flack coauthored with Eleanor Brush in science advances, conflicts of interest, improve collective computation of adaptive social structures. And so, yeah, this is one of those sort of awkward realities, if you will, that comes out of complex systems research, which is, if everyone's looking in the same direction, then that's actually an extremely fragile, brittle attention ecology.You're going to get hit in the back of the head with the Dodge ball, all of you. Whereas finding ways to accommodate a certain amount of polarization, actually results in a smarter society over the long-term. And I, you know, I was just talking about this on the show with James Evans a couple episodes ago, where he was talking about the overwhelming evidence, that if you look at the, you know, the science of science, and again, this is just maybe an advertisement for the kind of non disciplinarity going on at SFI, but the incentives of science, they tend to lead to these silos, which are extremely focused and therefore missing important things.And that massive scientific advancements it's like discreet shifts, scientific revolutions tend to come from naive outsiders that are willing to call to attention, something on the periphery of a given field. We spoke about this on the show with Carl Bergstrom and Jevon West about the importance of calling bullshit, the importance of finding ways to accommodate in our societies and in our organizations, the child that can call out the emperor for wearing no clothing.There's not really a question attached to that, but it just seems to me, it just seems like there is this sense in which as awkward as it is, it is good for us to accept some friction for all of these reasons, which include reasons like leaving a little slack in workday, evidence that taking some time off from a particular question, leads to a creative solution.Jonas Dalege (30m 17s): Great idea. Also, when we apply this model to creativity, the more you think about the issue, the more you will follow a given path. In some cases, this will be fine if you're on the right path, but sometimes you just have to take a step back and then just taking a walk outside might actually lead into having a fresh mind and then taking this problem from a different side and also on a more societal or a more on a group level. I mean, what you just said. I mean, that's also a bit about Koons writing about revolutions in science. If science discipline and science is on the right path, then this given paradigm works quite well.Right? So then you can make a lot of discourage that, but at some point, of course, you hit an end and that you need this outside influence and really something or someone to actually shake this up a bit so that you, that also the discipline as a, as a whole can actually tackle this other problems from a different angle. I think this is definitely one of the things that makes science so successful, actually that it's not only people who are very at the core of a given field. Not only they can influence the speed, but also someone coming from a different field or a young person's just coming in with new ideas. The test is given sense of anarchy insights.I think it's really makes it much stronger than if we would just have this more hierarchical structure. Michael Garfield (31m 26s): To link that into some of the insights from evolutionary biology that we discussed with David Krakauer in episode 29 on mass extinctions. There's a part of the transmission series when we were talking about system level shocks and the strategies, you know, higher, low mutation rates viruses are basically practicing what David called a high beta investment strategy because they're changing the context all the time. They're constantly being sneezed and do a different organism.They have a much more mutable identity. It calls to mind this question about the proliferation of cognitive dissonance in the 21st century. Would you agree that the rate of change and the sort of flexibility of a person's attitude, do you see it sort of obeying the same dynamics that, you know, a larger society plays by these rules of like the genetics of a large continental population versus a small Island population, then that it's easier to change your mind in a smaller community because you're trying to peg your beliefs and behaviors to a smaller number of people.Whereas on the mainland, you can get stuck in a sort of suboptimal position because you're trying to satisfy too many different constraints at the same time.Jonas Dalege (32m 50s): That's also a nice extension actually, of what we mostly talk about until now basically of how your own beliefs are related to each other. But of course your own beliefs, don't only depend on your other beliefs you have, but also on the beliefs of the people around you. It's an interesting idea too, if you have this larger society, I mean, my guess would actually be that in the last society, the beliefs, you have follow much more constraints than if you live in a very small community, but I mean, it can also be, of course they have this very small community where everyone is very highly dependent on everyone else.That of course could also lead you to being better constraint in how you can change your beliefs. But in general, I would think of course, the, the, the people around you put a high constraints on what you actually can believe and also what is actually okay for you to believe or what you think is okay for you to believe. Of course, there's a lot of disagreements in, in our society, but of course these follow a specific game rules. There's of course a lot of things we basically don't even consider. For example, even for something like democracy to work, it has to be that basically our beliefs all have to be constrained to a given level.Right? And I think that is something that actually society kind of accomplices that people are kind of, okay, you can, you can argue within this, given a set of beliefs, but not outside of that. Yeah.Michael Garfield (34m 5s): Out of intellectual integrity. I think it's important for us to mention that we're standing directly in the middle of a pre-print that you wrote with Mirta Galesic and Henrik and Tamara and Dan Stein, integrating social and cognitive aspects of belief dynamics towards a unifying framework, as someone who loves the, the powers of 10 multi-scale zoom that allows us to consider things like civilization as a superorganism and so on. I think it'd just be worth acknowledging this particular piece, just to give you the opportunity to go into a little bit more detail about that piece that we haven't already addressed. Jonas Dalege (34m 45s): Let's get also what this piece is about is it's also, it's very late to what my main project here at SFI is actually, and that is combining these individual or, or more personal beliefs that you have, and the dynamics of this, which my work has until now mostly focused on with more social belief dynamics, basically with the idea, okay, if there's people at the same time, want to reduce inconsistency and dissonance in their own belief system, but they also want to reduce dissonance at the social level. And of course, people can differ then in how important they judge these different levels.So for some, some people that might be more important, okay, that's their own beliefs dismissed, very consistent. Other people will be a bit more inclined to agree with the social network and so on. And what I think is also very interesting about this is that quite a lot of indications that actually what happens in a single humans mind is actually quite similar to happens in a group of humans. So for example, there's a lot of classic studies on group polarization. So basically if a group has kind of an inclined leaning toward a given issue, let's say it's about abortion.And most of the individuals in the group are pro-choice and then they discuss about this. And then after discussing this, people will actually move to being even more pro choice. And at the same time, there's also studies on single individuals. When you ask people to think about the attitudes, the can kind of the same happens. So if I ask someone who is, let's say moderately pro-choice and I asked this person, they have to think a bit about your attitude. Then after a few minutes, this person will actually move a bit more towards the extreme. For me, this is really, really very interesting. It's kind of similar dynamics going on at these different levels.That is always, I think fascinating also lends us then to integrating these different dynamics into the same model. The paper you just mentioned is actually one of our first steps in doing this, and we're actually working much more on this.Michael Garfield (36m 34s): Minds, me of Jessica Flax paper on core screening as downward causation and how, you know, if you think about what a society is doing by aggregating and evaluating input from all of these local measurements and, you know, local attitudes about reality at the level of a social creature. That's intimately related to what each of us are doing in terms of modeling everyone else's opinions. And so you end up with the social contract or, you know, to use a sort of less endorsed term, the Holy ghost of a society is something that emerges at the intersections of people. And again, to link that to when we had Mirta on the show in episode nine, and she was talking about how you see this in voting, you were just talking about how people care about what their friends and family think, and that can outweigh your own personal convictions about who you should be voting for, but something that I, you know, I wonder again, in terms of how modern society differs from the kind of societies sub Dunbar number of societies that we evolved in, you know, smaller tribes, clans villages, et cetera. I think you kind of spoke to this when we were talking about Island biogeography, that affluence, that arises in subpopulations as a consequence of economies of scale, there's something about the way that privilege creates the opportunity for us to care less about each other's opinions and therefore erodes the social contract. And I think us back to the point about what it takes for people to regard a particular subject as urgent and imminent, whereas you talk to people that are like, "Oh, I'm not worried about the collapse of society because I've got enough money that I'll just be able to wall myself off from that."You can see the shifting in the weights between what I believe in what I believe about what other people believe and how much importance I place on other people's beliefs. And so there's this weird what to me was a counterintuitive consequences of all of that, which is that the more affluent we become as a society, generally, the less we actually function as a society. Does this accord with everything that you've come to?Jonas Dalege (38m 52s): I definitely agree that there's definitely too dangerous there. I mean, meta actually mentioned this in her podcast. It's much easier to find people that agree with you that used to be right. I mean, if you live in a small village with just a given number of people, of course you have, your options are limited. And now basically you can just go online and find people who agree with you. It's also this reports on people in this QANON movement or whatever you want to call it. That really, they cut all the links to their family members, to their old friends, and just talk to two other  QANON members that's that's of course, a point where it gets very dangerous.And then it also brings me back to what I said earlier. That polarization isn't always a problem, but if it reaches a point where you don't talk to each other anymore and just talk to people who you agree with, then of course at some point society cannot function anymore. And also the problem arises. If you don't agree on facts, then of course you also can't really have functional discussions anymore.Michael Garfield (39m 52s): You end your piece on attitudinal entropy by facing forward into the questions that remain unanswered, and then also how this model relates to other models of attitude. So I'm giving you a sort of choose your own adventure here about which of those to tackle first. But I think for the sake of feeling complete at the end of this discussion, I'd love to know how you compare this model to other models and then where you are pointed beyond what we've already discussed in this call into the questions that this work has opened for you.Jonas Dalege (40m 28s): Let's start with the model comparison, which in psychology often it's a bit different from more formal fields because there's much less formal theories in psychology. So it's often a bit difficult to directly compare different models. So I would say the most important thing to go forward is, okay, let's see how these different predictions that we have pan out. And one thing I I'm excited about and want to understand also better is actually extreme shifts in attitudes. Our model actually predicts that generally, if a partner is very important to you, you will be very resistant to change, but at the same time, if you get enough information that you cannot hold onto your original attitudes, you will flip to another extreme.And there's really quite a lot of anecdotal evidence on this. So for example, there's this German lawyer who used to work for the F, which is used to be a left wing terrorist organization in Germany, mostly during the sixties and seventies, but then he switched at some point to become one of the most outspoken neo-Nazis in Germany. So he's completely switched from the most extreme left to the most extreme, right? Also there's this evidence about people actually losing their faith.So for example, I think there was this pastor within, at some point for him, it didn't make sense anymore. And then he started this group with which he helps people actually discarding their religion enters on group for becoming atheists. So there's a lot of evidence about us that people actually cannot sometimes change their attitudes quite, quite radically, but there's not that much systematic studies about this. And I think this is really something our model has a lot to say about. And I think it would be really great to test this in a systematic way.Michael Garfield (42m 11s): Yeah. You know, to bring up the whole thing about the converted atheist, that is just such an interesting topic because it's so clear to so many people that a lot of these, Oh, I used to feel that way. And then I had a revelation kind of personal narratives are really just a shift across the Y axis into an equally extreme, but opposite position that resolves a person's cognitive dissonance that they've been developing about the creator or whatever, but it doesn't actually indicate an evolutionary transition for that person in terms of like their psychological development.They haven't actually gained any kind of distance from the level of organization at which they were constructing their identity in the way that we were talking about earlier with James Fowler. You give another really interesting anecdotal example of this in the op-ed that you sent me on the proud boys, and I'd love to offer something concrete to people. I think talking about Trump supporters before and after January 6th and the attack on the Capitol is a really clear case that illustrates the insights of your model here.Jonas Dalege (43m 23s): Yeah. I was really struck by this article in the New York times about how the proud boys actually shifted their attitudes to work Trump in a quite extreme fashion after the storming of the capital, because they felt betrayed by Trump because they didn't receive any parts and so on. And then really a few days after the storming of the Capitol, they started to mock Trump on their social media and really called him weak, a trader, a total failure and so on. And then, I mean, this, this is a group that used to see Trump as the Messiah, almost for them.Trump was really a very potent, very unifying figure, but then the shift then that they, that they saw them as betraying them. That really shifted their attitudes completely from seeing him as a strong and loyal. And so on it as a great president, they really, they saw him as weak and disloyal and really as a, as a complete failure, as I, as I said, and I think this really illustrates the working of our model quite well, because it's not that they just shifted their attitude a little bit. I mean, they could have also said, okay, yeah, he might have been disloyal to us, but maybe, well, he didn't also have that much opportunities there and so on, but they really had to shift completely.And of course it's also amplified actually by the group dynamic. Then if some person in their social media started to call them failure, of course, it's also put pressure on the other members to agree with this or shift the attitudes. But of course, as you also said, they just shifted from one extreme to the other. It's not that they're actually become any more nuisance than before. It's just from one highly idealized attitude. They shifted just to one other, very idealized and very simplistic attitude.Michael Garfield (44m 60s): So maybe a little, the place to wrap this then would be to, you know, just invite a little bit of discussion about a question that you pose at the end of this paper, about the possibility of finding neural substrates for this. You compare what's going on here in networks of beliefs with the heavy and learning that fire together, wire together, learning of neurons in the brain. And you know, when you look at this kind of phenomenon at the social level, again, if you think about it as a human behavior in society, as a, as a form of collective computation than it is sort of like these people that are firing together, behaviorly are forming these neural motifs at the level of society and thereby determining the identity of a nation or, or whatever.Do you think that it's going to be just a clear one to one? Are we going to find the fingerprint of belief in the brain in this way? Or do you think it's going to be a bit more of a abstract relationship between a person's connectome and their beliefs and behavior? Do you think we're really going to be able to like brain scan somebody in 20 years and tell them what they believe? Yeah,Jonas Dalege (46m 13s): No, I don't think so. There's also quite a movement in brain size in Europe. Neuro-psychology acknowledging that trying to locate certain functions in the brain is not really the optimal way to go, but it's really much more about the complex interactions between different brain areas that can actually tell us much more about the functioning of the human mind. And I think I completely agree with this view and I think it also lends this to our work that is really at the psychological level where we also want to stress, okay. The complex interactions between different psychological factors, this matches this view that we have to study the brain in its complex form much better.Michael Garfield (46m 51s): Awesome. Any parting thoughts before we put a pin on this?Jonas Dalege (46m 55s): I think it's very important to think a bit more about how we can actually get back to more nuanced opinions, tolerating also ambiguity.Michael Garfield (47m 4s): Awesome. This has been a pleasure to talk to you today. Thanks for being on the show.Jonas Dalege (47m 9s): Sure. Thank you for having me.Speaker 3 (47m 13s): Thank you for listening.

57,Episode Details / Transcript Orit Peleg (0s): Noise in a natural biological system can actually be beneficial. What we knew from the literature is that bees have a distribution of threshold that trigger the fanning behavior. There's not just like one temperature value distribution becomes wider when there is higher genetic variability. And what we showed was the model is actually having this variability of the threshold point to trigger the behavior can be really beneficial and help them create these aggregations more optimally. The reason for this is coming from the aggregation process itself. So if you can imagine one bee that is fanning, driving hot air from the hive outside, this bee is standing, The temperature is going to be slightly higher. And then it's going to decrease kind of gradually as you get further away from that bee. If you just had a constant threshold that triggers the fanning, then every bee will just start kind of randomly fanning. But then if there's some bee that has a slightly lower threshold have higher density to start spending closer to the beat that is already funding because of the temperature distribution there. So having the noise, having the variability in this threshold point is actually really helpful for this process of aggregation. Michael Garfield (1m 40s): More than the sum of its parts is practically the slogan of systems thinking. One canonical example is a beehive individually. A honeybee is not that clever, but together they can function like shape-shifting metamaterials or mesh networks. Some of humankind's most sophisticated innovations Emergent collective behavior is common in the insect world and not just among superstar collaborators like bees, ants and termites. One firefly alone blinks randomly together. Fireflies affect an awe-inspiring synchrony in large coordinated light shows. Scientists are only starting to explain. It turns out that diversity is key. Even in a swarm variety improves the computations that these swarms perform as they adapt to their surroundings, watch themselves organized for long enough. And you might ask, is this what people do? What hidden patterns and emergent genius do we all participate in unawares. If bees and fireflies inspire that kind of question in you you'll find yourself at home in this week's episode. Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. In this conversation, we talked to SFI External Professor Orit Peleg at the University of Colorado Boulders Bio Frontiers Institute and Computer Science Department about her research into the collective behavior of bees and fireflies. These humble insects can together do amazing things. And what science shows about just how they do it points to deeper insights on the nature of noise, creativity, and life in our complex world. If you value our research and communication efforts, please rate and review us @applepodcasts and/or consider making a donation at santafe.edu/podcast.

I'm really honored to be here. And I'm excited to talk to you today Michael Garfield (4m 1s): To kick things off in the realm of the human, rather than the realm of the insect, I'd like to invite you to talk a little bit about your path into being a scientist and what got you interested in it, what compelled you to pursue this professionally, why it is that you study these particular topics in your biography and your passion. Orit Peleg (4m 25s): I grew up in Israel and I actually studied physics and computer science. I was majoring in that in high school and I didn't like it very much then, but then later on, I got really excited about astronomy. Just kept on finding myself, thinking about how I'm just a tiny little creature in a vast, vast universe and how it's so difficult to perceive everything, from my perspective is a small little creature. I think that's kind of what drew me into liking physics and wanting to study physics at the university, which I did. I didn't end up working on astronomy because I sort of rolled into a summer research program as an undergrad with a professor at the Physics Department. And he was working on biological physics. So things sort of rolled out from there. I still think I kind of try to think about how things look like from the perspective of a small little creature building block in a complex system, only in biological systems, which turn out to be just beautifully and vastly reach. So that's kind of how I got into it. There's been a lot more hopping from fields and continents throughout the years. And now I'm here at Boulder, also associated with SFI. Michael Garfield (5m 46s): I think there are so many people who draw a very natural kind of analogy between stars in the sky and fireflies. In some weird sense, it's like nothing has changed of course a lot. It seems to me like actually the right place to start diving into your work is with the honeybee swarm work. And then we can go from there into the firefly work. So the first piece I'd like to discuss with you is this piece for nature physics that you led collective mechanical adaptation of honeybee swarms, and actually seeing you present on this at SFI was one of my first really like exciting vivid memories of sitting in Cowan campus, watching you give this presentation on the swarm behavior of bees and how they respond to someone sitting there shaking a branch off a tree. So this is a rather beautiful and devious experiment that you set up to understand the collective behavior of swarms. Why don't you take us in and give us a little exposition on the thinking that led you into this particular paper and then how you and your coauthors Peters, Saucedo, and Mahadevan went about actually doing this research? Orit Peleg (7m 6s): So that's definitely one of the most exciting projects I had so far. I think the vision was coming from my postdoc advisor Mahadevan who is really good in seeing people who work on different systems and what kind of skills they have and how this can be projected to new and exciting problems. So I was working on microscopic biological active matter at the time, and he sort of saw that connection to a larger biological active matter. You were kind of illustrating it to use your hands, but I'm guessing our listeners don't get to see that. So the structure that the bees create is material. So the bees really connect. They're linking their bodies. They're not flying. They're actually holding each other or holding a tree branch. They do this in very large numbers. There's tens of subtleties of individuals who are creating the structure and they have to deal with a lot of environmental perturbations coming from just static forces coming from gravity, but then also more dynamic ones coming from wings. And it's really just from a mechanical perspective, so amazing that they're able to maintain clinical stability and not break. So how do they know how to do this when the swarm is so large and an individual is so small that it can only directly coordinate with nearest neighbors? And sometimes these mechanical stability actually demands the simultaneous collective coordination throughout the material. So that was the questioning in mind. The area, as you already pointed out, was a little bit crazy I would say is maybe one way to describe it. One approach to study these kinds of systems is to just observe them in their natural habitat, unperturbed. Another way tends to be really helpful is to do something through the system to change something in the environment, and then from seeing how the system responds to these probations. Maybe we can learn something interesting about its underlying principles. So that was the logical idea behind shaking a swarm of 10,000 stingy honeybees. Turns out the main result was that when we continue checking the bees right and left, then these start moving around in the swarm and they collectively change the swarming to a more flat structure and more flat comb. And then when we stop, they start slowly go back to their steady state configuration. We combine this also with the computational model that helped us isolate and point to possible rules of local behavior with the bees are following. And in that case, it was local mechanical forces that they're sensing between them and the bonds that they create to their neighbors. From that point on, we just kind of extrapolated on that and came up with a set of local rules where they sense these forces and go up the strain gradient towards the attachment surface of the swarm to get everything to spread out. And this is all based on local rules of behavior. So only they're sensing local information about the mechanical forces responding to it, but that in turn leads to a global change in the system, Michael Garfield (10m 19s): Just to help people get a picture of this, what we're talking about is actually like in a laboratory setting There's a plate hanging from the ceiling of the bees. They're hanging from the plate. The plate is on a motor and it's just vibrating back and forth until you get the bees to basically hunker down except it's hunkering up. So as the structure changes as bees at the tip of this column are responding to the basically big the end of a swaying rope, having to climb up to a place where they're not jiggling around quite so much. I'm curious if you think that the analogy I'm about to offer is a valid analogy. One of the thoughts that I have listening to you talk about conversations I've had, and I've heard with numerous other people at SFI. One was captured in episode 29 when David Krakauer and I were talking about mass extinctions and how the depth of an ecosystem changes due to perturbations of the entire ecosystem and commit hits the earth at the end of the Cretaceous period. There's like a limbo bar that anything larger than I think it was like five kilos or something was almost guaranteed to go extinct. I wonder if you think that these same kind of mechanical properties that you're observing in swarming behavior have a fundamental relationship to the distribution of niches and metabolic functions and body size and all of that when you're perturbing not just a swarm of bees, but you're perturbing entire ecosystems.   Orit Peleg (11m 54s):So I actually think a lot about what you just described. My sense is that these systems of large swarms of insects for example, are kind of working as distributed agents. They're making decisions based in a distributed way based on perhaps local information. So when something happens to the environment, it can be something catastrophic, like shaking them or hitting them out, things that makes them really uncomfortable and can potentially lead to devastating consequences. It seems like these systems of insects are really good in adapting to these unexpected and very harsh changes to the environment. So one example is what we just talked about is the mechanical forces. We've also shown more recently that the bees are able to harness and sense locally fields off the airflow to handle temperature and ventilation, and even more recently fields of chemical concentrations. And they somehow mastered the ability to sense these complex physical fields just locally and know how to manipulate them. I don't know if that completely answered your question, but they thought this is where you're going with this. Michael Garfield (13m 8s): I definitely want to get to these other papers that you just mentioned, but just to clarify that question, another example might be obviously looking at bees in the aggregate in this way has a lot in common with looking at human beings in aggregate behavior, in socio physics models, where you're looking at the entire riot, the entire marathon or you're doing economics modeling where the individual decisions are just sort of below the level of resolution of the way that you're actually watching changes in the market. We just had J. Doyne Farmer on, and he was talking about people who just follow the behavior of other people. And he was describing a model in which you see the entire economic system deform due to indigenous strains in the same way that it seems that you're talking about these swarms, just one of these questions of to what extent can we derive insights from this kind of research into understanding collective human behavior and collective behavior in systems that are not composed just of one species, but of many species. Orit Peleg (14m 23s): All of these are fascinating problems. I always get my brain gets a little fuzzy when I try to think about all the complexity of all the ecosystems and how sensitive it is to all these small interactions between individuals. I wouldn't go ahead and say that these are more resilient. It's hard to compare the resiliency of these insect forms to human behavior, collective behavior. But that's showing is that also with the bees was probably a point where things can catastrophically go wrong and the system is not prepared to handle these situations. Michael Garfield (14m 59s): That seems to strike at the heart of that question, which is if you shake the thing hard enough, it does not cohere? The swarm actually breaks apart or the bees leave. I'm just thinking about Stephanie Crabtree wrote a piece for the transmission essay series that we did last year, where she was talking about the end of the Chaco Canyon culture, as, as we understand. It was not like these people all died. It was that their agricultural system was so perturbed by climate change that they basically scattered.  IP Fest, panelist Annalee Newitz wrote a book about this exact thing, scatter adapt and remember about human society is basically getting to the point where the social graph fragments, because things are just too crazy. But rather than linger on this, I would like to talk about this piece that you mentioned a moment ago about collective ventilation and honeybee nests and how bees are working together to regulate the temperature inside their hive. And I think it's worth just because this is such a juicy vocabulary word it's worth bringing up as you do in this paper and defining for people stigmergy, such a core concept here. Orit Peleg (16m 13s): So in the more classical sense, stigmergy is a process where two or more individuals are communicating through cues in the environment. So one very famous example of that is ants when they lay pheromones when they're foraging for food. So each ant is the positing a little drop of pheromones on the way to and on the way back from a food source. So the nest and then other ants who forage kind of randomly have a higher probability to go into directions where there's a higher concentration of pheromones, which means it's ants were already there, which creates this positive feedback loop that leads the ants in the shortest path, from the food to the back home. So that's just one example in more classical sense. These cues that are laid in the environment that were described so far were tend to be cues that diffused passively. So if it's pheromones, they kind of diffuse passively by the laws of physics and then just follow that kind of spreading behavior. So that's kind of synergy in the classical sense, but what we showed in the paper that we'll talk about now is the ventilation also with the mechanical shaking and also with the aggregation behavior, is that the bees do something active to change these cues in the environment. This would then be communicated to other individuals in making things more complex, but also much more interesting, at least I think so. Michael Garfield (17m 43s): Again, to lay out the experimental design a little bit, I think one of the things that I found interesting, the way that you're kind of required to constrain some of the variables of this experiment was that you and your coauthors chose to use a particular kind of beekeeping hive, the Langstroth beehive, which has this long narrow entrance. And so you've controlled for rather than looking at wild beehives with like all of these sort of different organic configurations that emerge again out of this kind of collaboration with environmental factors, you've set up a situation that makes it much, much easier to actually observe what's going on and compare it from hive to hive. So that's just a point of to celebrate, like thinking about how to design experiments like this. Orit Peleg (18m 36s): First of all, I just want to give a shout out to the rest of the coursers. My contribution here was mostly analytical modeling. My peers did all of these beautiful experiments. It ended up being really convenient that most of the commercial hives were actually helping us reduce the dimensionality of the problem from complex three-dimensional entrance sizes and shapes to something that is almost one dimensional, Michael Garfield (19m 0s): A clear sense again, of how does simplify this in a real world setting and not just in a mathematical model, but now let's get into your model. This is cool. The way that you unpack, it's a different kind of strain then a swinging swarm. You're still seeing a redistribution of labor based on the bees making these local assessments and then moving to sort of balance out that distribution of labor. So you wanna talk about some of the details of this model and then what emerged from it, and then how that compared to what you were actually seeing in the observation of flesh and blood beehives? Orit Peleg (19m 40s): The main thing we were trying to explain is how do bees decide where to ventilate their hive. A little bit of background there is that you already mentioned this really, really narrow one dimensional entrance. And then usually for these commercial hives, there's also a little wooden piece in the beekeeping. Jargon is called the porch, and then the bees can just sit on their porch and what they do to ventilate the hive is fan their wings. So they're really just like your fans. And then the question is where should they stand? Where should they fan along these one-dimensional entrance. We already knew from Jake's experiments that they tend to do this in little groups. So they kind of aggregate at one position along the one dimensional entrance and they all fan their wings together. In terms of explaining how this is achieved based on sensing local information, this is where the mathematical model came into the picture. And the idea was that we know the bees are sensitive to temperature. They can sense temperature. Above a certain threshold of temperature above a certain value of the ambient temperature they have a higher tendency to start standing. So that was one ingredient that we put into our model. The second ingredient was related to a posing airflow. So you mentioned that you have one bee that is standing on the porch, and it's finding its wings driving hot air from inside hive to the colder environment. And then because of conservation of mass, there's going to be some colder air from the environment going back into the hive. But every time we have these two opposing flows, we're going to have some friction that is happening at the interface between these two opposing flows. So on one hand, we want to have many bees fanning. On the other hand, we want to minimize that friction energy loss that is coming from opposing flows. And we also want to minimize the bees sort of working against each other. If it is a happy group of bees scanning one position along the entrance. Where they're not standing is where the colder air is going to come into the hive. But then if these start sending there and fanning, they're going to oppose that air flow. So there's going to be some energy loss there as well. So we're kind of posing this as an optimization problem of what would be the most optimal configuration that would allow for global airflow, but still minimize all of these energy loss. And these are the main ingredients that we placed in the mathematical model, I don't know how much you want to go into the details, but we basically it was too complicated to get an analytical solution, but we solved it numerically and received really similar results to what we see in the experiments. We get the aggregation of bees that are fanning the wings together in one position along the entrance. And that helps them to create that global airflow in and out of the hive. Michael Garfield (22m 31s): One thing that I found curious about the factors that you're putting together in forming this model was that as it says here in the paper, when you're talking about task threshold model, when the demand for a task is large, more individual bees respond due to broad variation in task thresholds. This variation is higher in colonies with a queen, which has made it multiple times and promote temporal stability with regulation. So what is going on here? The maturity of the queen figures into this, but what is that? Orit Peleg (23m 3s): Let me try to unpack all of this. So, first of all, more generally, I think it's another really nice example, how noise in a natural biological system can actually be beneficial. Let me explain. What we knew from the literature is that bees have a distribution of threshold that trigger the fanning behavior. There's not just one temperature value distribution becomes wider when there is higher genetic variability, which is comes, you know, to the point with the queen or the mating history basically. And what's the genetic variability of all the worker bees. And what we showed you is the model, is it actually having this variability of this threshold point to trigger the behavior can be really beneficial and help them create these aggregations more optimally in comparison to a situation where there's really a sharps threshold uniform for all the worker bees. The reason for this is coming from the aggregation process itself. So if you can imagine one bee that is fanning driving hot air from the hive outside. So where this bee is standing, the temperature is going to be slightly higher. And then it's going to decrease kind of gradually as you get further away from that bee. If you just had a constant threshold that triggers defending, then nothing would really happen here. Everybody will just start kind of randomly no matter where it is along the interest to start fanning. But then if there's some point it'd be that has a slightly lower density to start fending closer to the bee that is already shining because of the temperature distribution there. So having the noise, having the variability in this threshold point is actually really helpful for this process of aggregation. Michael Garfield (24m 51s): It's funny how it seems like every single conversation we have on this show gets back to the value of noise and the value of diversity in these complex systems. I'm reminded of a conversation I just heard with SFI Miller scholar, Lawrence Gonzalez. He was on behind the shield podcast recently, which is like a firefighter and emergency response show. And he was talking about the natural distribution in risk tolerance in people. It's good that we have some people that are highly risk averse and some people that are risk seeking. And of course, thinking about the writing that SFI Chair Economist, Michael Mauboussin has done on risk. So there seems like a loop from that back to the first paper that we discussed, which is about bee. They're all seeking a lower strain. I don't remember this being in that paper, but it seems like there were probably bees that were more likely to try and climb the column and get to an easier place and bees that were down there swinging at the bottom, like, "yes, this is fun." And that we need this basically. So that swarms and hives, don't kind of like seize up. And when all the neurons start firing at the same time. Maybe this has an interesting connection to the firefly stuff, but I'm getting ahead of us here just to throw one more piece on it for people that are interested in, in what this means in terms of scientific research. It reminds me of the conversation that we had with James Evans was talking about the science of science and how big scientific ideas emerge in these gaps between disciplines. They tend to be discovered by people that are crossing from one discipline to another, which is inherently inefficient. To cross an inferential distance between one way of understanding modeling the world and another being used by a different domain is energetically costly. And so in a way I feel like your beehive ventilation work is an arrow in the quiver of the argument for interdisciplinary science, because you're saying, "listen, we need people willing to take intellectual risks here, otherwise our knowledge community hive would just overheat and die." Orit Peleg (27m 13s): I love it. Everything you just said, very more for interdisciplinary science. And if we can actually add another metal level to that philosophical arguments, I think that just to connect it to the swarm shaking experiments, I think that over there, the noise or the flexibility, I would think of more in the transition from phases, from solid to liquid to gas. And let me bind this back to earth. So solid leads and crystals, they have a really pretty fine configuration, so it's very predictable. But it doesn't really allow for exploration. And that's a really important process for the electrical systems to actually adapt to varying changing environments and unknown conditions. When I think about the swarm structure, it's something in between the solid and the liquid. There's still definitely some constant and strong bonds between individuals, but as it kind of melts and change shapes, it's a bit more behaving, a bit more like liquid. And I think being in that transition where they can switch from these two configuration is really important for their mechanical stability, but then also for their survival. Michael Garfield (28m 32s): There's just one more point I want to let you unpack here before we get into the next piece, which is something you mentioned in the conclusion of this paper is that if the bees fanned into the nest entrance, rather than out of it, they would have no information about the state of the hive. Interestingly, another cavity nesting, the honeybee species, apis cerana, fans into the nest. So, you know, you just mentioned in passing that this, this other honeybee species is likely using an alternative strategy. What, like, it seems like everything that you just said about how the, you know, the collective computation of the hive is actually functioning. So what do you think is going on in these contrary situations? Orit Peleg (29m 20s): The mechanism, the model mathematical model, would actually still work based on only having the information of the temperature at the entrance. You don't really need to know what is the temperature inside and outside. From that perspective, it would work. I just think that for bees who send air outside of the hive, they have this extra piece of information where, because they are driving air, they also might be able to sense what's going on, what's the temperature inside the hive. But I have no idea why this other species of bees do it reversely. And it just to add to the mystery, there's some really interesting behavior in feral honey bees, where when the entrance size is very small, they don't just aggregate in one point along the entrance because it's so small, it doesn't really make sense. So they start switching from that strategy and intermittent fanning. So they fan for a little bit and then stop then fan for a little bit and then stop, which is really similar to what we do when we breeze, by the way we kind of have we introduce airflow and then stop, introduce effort and stop. So there are all these wild behaviors in the natural environments that I think would be really cool to kind of explore and understand also in the context of this model Michael Garfield (30m 40s): Or reckless speculation. I wonder if you pointed to the opening at the entrance of the high, of being of a different size in different species. And wonder if that has any relationship to the economic discussion around scaling trust, like scaling, coupling between people. I've been having a conversation on Facebook about usury and how historically my dad's side of the family's Jewish. Interest bearing debt is something that you don't do within your own community. It's something that seems to have emerged as a way of accommodating a certain amount of risk for engaging in financial transactions with people outside of a circle of trust. I wonder again, if there's some sort of underlying pattern here in the way that you see bees operating collectively. You basically said as much that it seems like the size and shape of the entrance is a key figure in this. I would be curious to know whether this has something to do with scaling laws. Whether you see the emergence of these new collective properties as a result of the size of the hive, and then the size, the size that the entrance of the hive has to be in order to accommodate a hive of that population. Orit Peleg (31m 58s): That would be really interesting to see the size of the entrance and see at what point they switched strategies. And I don't know the answer to that, but I think it's a really cool direction. Michael Garfield (32m 11s): You just published this other study led by Nguyen, Iuzzolino, Mankel, Bozek, Stephens, Peleg. Large, large Colorado team, mostly Amsterdam.Orit Peleg (32m 34s): Japan, Germany. So it's kind of international, which has been really, really fun. So all the authors on this paper are just fantastic. And it's been a collaborative effort. Michael Garfield (32m 47s): This piece flow mediated, olfactory communication, and honey bees swarms helps answer a question that I am sure many people naively had is as a child, which is how on earth are these bees finding their way home? How are they communicating with one another over these great distances over the so-called sight line of the dancing and visual communication? Without getting too far ahead of ourselves and spoiling it there's it seems like there's some really interesting implications here about human telecommunications networks and how we can structure those in a way that draws on the sort of intelligence of evolved living systems rather than designed technological systems. Can you talk a little bit about this piece please, how you use the modeling and then also the machine vision, which has led for some really interesting videos to share over social that we'll link to in the show notes. Orit Peleg (33m 45s): This is a piece I'm really proud of. It's one of my first, last authors paper. So I'm very excited about it. The question as you already pointed out is how do bees that are far away from the queen managed to locate her when they're actually relying on pheromones that are very volatile molecules at the cave rapidly in time-space. It was already known that of course, bees use pheromones and they have this behavior called scenting. So what they're doing is basically sticking their abdomen up, which exposes a pheromone gland. And then they found the wings, which drives airflow on top of that farmland and basically distribute these pheromones in the direction of the airflow. What we found out is that when a worker bee is getting close to the queen, instead of just walking all the way to the queen, it would stop at a certain distance and scent. So amplify these pheromones, and it would do it away from the queen. And then in another, we will do the same thing based on those amplified pheromone. And so it would stop and propagate them backwards and so on and so on. This relay activation process which basically allows the pheromones to travel distances that are much longer than they would be able to if it was only coming from a single bee. So that's the general process. I should probably also clarify, just related to what you said before. We know that this is helpful on a length scale of, a few meters let's say, but bees actually forage over very large distances of up to five miles, I believe is the number. They definitely have other strategies to find a way back home passing integration and visual cues and so on. But actually one of the first things was shown with these usage of pheromones is that when there's forging these exiting the hive, there's a bunch of bees setting again on the porch and they're sending these times, so they're creating these pheromones and there's a positive correlation between the number of sending bees and the success rate of foragers to come back to the hive. So it could be that they sort of find a way closer to the hive, but then these pheromones actually on the length scale of a few meters really guides them back to their hive. So that's kind of the biology. Experiments we basically had a semi two-dimensional arena where the queen is located in one corner. And then we put all the rest of the bees at the other corner, and then we can see how they start exploring their arena and sending inform the rest of the bees. And this is where the new computer vision code came into place. And that was solely the contribution of Greg Stephans and Kesha Bowser who guided to my creating this new machine learning code. And the idea was using some training that other to be created, they were able to create a code that would classify and find all of these scenting events. So of course for us, this was a major upgrade to us watching the videos and clicking on all of the scenting events. It allowed us to have a really large datasets relatively quickly. And then the really cool seeing the really like aha moment there was when we played the movie, we stop it at a certain frame and then we can see all the positions that the bees are scenting and in which direction they're scenting. And then if we take all of these little directions, they create and integrate them into something that looks more like a global map. We saw that it really leads to the queen. So falling all of these local directional cues that are coming from individual bees are trying to find the queen can follow these and it would really lead them to the position of the queen. So that was a really exciting moment. That's kind of broadly and I'm happy to elaborate on any other points. Michael Garfield (37m 46s): The things that came out of this that I thought was interesting in figure two, you talk about the distance between sending bees is invariant to be density, suggestive that the bees have a computational strategy. Orit Peleg (38m 2s): Thank you for bringing this up. This wasn't really also another important point. Another important piece of information we got from the experiments. So let's assume that we have a bee that is producing pheromones. For the sake of the argument, assume that it's producing them as a tropically. So it moves, it spreads the same in all directions. If you have another bee that is exploring the space, depending on the distance that be from the sending bee, it's going to sense the particular concentration of pheromones, depending on how far it is from the same thing, the distance is directly to the concentration of pheromones. That bee would sense. And the fact that they are actually spaced in order to very particular characteristic distance from each other, suggest that they might be using concentration of pheromones to position themselves. So that was one big component that we included in the computational model, which is the bees might be able to send formal concentrations. And once they reach a certain threshold, then they would stop moving and start scenting themselves so amplifying the pheromones in a certain direction and the direction in this case, we chose also to be related to the gradient of concentration of pheromones. So they would have a tendency to move the pheromones backwards towards the less informed bees. Michael Garfield (39m 24s): I don't know if this is a valid point, but it strikes me a lot as kind of akin to being on college campus and like trying to find the party. By the time you get to the party, you're done looking for the party. You're not trying to find the busiest room in the party. Instead, you're calling your friends, telling them where the party is. Orit Peleg (39m 48s): That sounds as long as you're not calling them over cell phones, it would have a long-range connection. Then I think it's a valid analogy. Michael Garfield (39m 55s): Let's say instead of a party, it's a protest and that we're using a Bluetooth mesh network that's percolating a signal through Bluetooth. It's not just like point to point, but you actually have to, the signal has to diffuse. It seems very, very useful information for people who are organizing rallies and that kind of thing. There's a lot of other interesting stuff about this, but for the sake of time, I want to make sure that we get to your work on fireflies for Photinus Carolinus, such a lovely name and you were last author on a piece in Royal society interface on using 360 degree cameras to actually like start to substantiate or to ground all of the models that people have tried to make about fireflies synchronization in actual data. So there's some really cool coverage of this research that has come out in various press publications we'll link to in the show note. You can see pictures of this extraordinary field work that you got to participate in. And so this is just, you know, I would love to hear you talk a little bit about this piece and how your team came up with the idea to do this, how that facilitated a more rigorous quantitative approach to studying firefly synchronization. Orit Peleg (41m 16s): Where it all started is really doing undergrad, where I took some physics classes and we handle the comical systems and mostly focused on the math, but we had a really nice teacher. We have a lot of nice examples, relatable examples. For example, synchronization. And still to this day, remember the example of fireflies and how they synchronize their flashes. So really, I would say kind of grew up on these ideas that fireflies are landmark example of synchronization in nature. And they correlate that this behavior can be explained by a very wide reach set of mathematical models that are generally hard to as the core multimodal where individual agents are considered to be oscillators that perform some periodic function. And then there is some coupling between pairs of agents that leads them to synchronize their phases in the periodic process. And that's kind of generally. I guess when I was kind of thinking about starting my own lab and what do you want to writing my research statement and all these sort of things. I also watched a lot of nature documentaries, which is something that I try to do all the time, whenever I have time. And so I came across some beautiful movies of fireflies. And I started thinking about all of these mathematical models and reading a little bit more deeply into the literature. It turns out that there was really very little quantitative data on firefight flashes and there's many good reasons for that. Most of the research was published a couple of 10 or 20 years ago when cameras and technology equipment made it really hard to record large swarms of fireflies, they have to be really close to the cameras in order to be captured. And also the firefly synchronization behavior is really rare. So you have to be there. They're in the right place at the right time. Fireflies have these interesting life cycle where they are spending they're adults who flash what I think people usually think about when they think about flashing fireflies. So they're adults for about two weeks out of the year, and then the rest of the year, they're kind of underground and waiting, springing down. Even within these two weeks, they only flash for a few hours every night. So it's really kind of a race against time to try to capture their behavior. So all I'm saying is that it's been kind of difficult to capture this data and somebody who is insistent enough to actually really care about this and go out to the field. So we actually drove to the field site in Tennessee last year and the previous year for a couple of weeks and managed to actually capture some quantitative data about swarms of fireflies. Michael Garfield (44m 16s): Just to set this up in people's minds, what we're talking about is setting up multiple 360 GoPros so that you get a stereoscopic view two, 360 panoramas, that then allow you to correlate things in 3d.  Orit Peleg (44m 32s):In these mathematical models, the distance between the flashing firefighter can be really important. So we really wanted to have this 3d representation or fireflies. And the idea for the 360 cameras was actually from a very talented post-doc I have in my lab who came up with this idea, which is really cool because when we position these 360 cameras, we really get a nice view of the swarm from inside the swarm, almost like we're no single firefly inside the swarm. We can see what's going on around in comparison to having external cameras Michael Garfield (45m 8s): Again, to contrast this to previous work that's been done on this, you mentioned in this paper that previous measurements by Copeland and Moiseff described similar intermittent or discontinuous synchronicity, but your observations were different than theirs. They looked at it as sort of like a square wave where it seemed to them group flashing started and stopped abruptly, but you actually measured a kind of gradation into an out of synchrony, which seems like something you might only notice if you're being able to, as you just said, watch the entire thing at once. Then also there's a piece in this study on flight and how these are not just static points that are coordinating with each other, but they're all changing their distance from each other in this cloud. So each one is this point that's moving around inside the swarm. And if I'm to understand this correctly, that's like one of the mechanisms behind the sort of slop that you see as the system is moving in and out of synchrony. That it's like jostling inside. Orit Peleg (46m 11s): So there's definitely some mixing coming from the movement of the fireflies. We don't fully understand it yet. It seems to be like this mixing doesn't have a directionality, so the fireflies are flying. And if you look at the collection of flight trajectories, the reason the particular direction in which they all tend to move to, this is probably coming from a search behavior because what's happening is that the males are the ones that are flying in and flashing in synchrony. And they are the reason for synchronization in the first place is for mating purposes. So they're looking for females who tend to be closer to the ground and more statuary. But the idea of mixing here is very intriguing in terms of also connecting these two mathematical models, Michael Garfield (46m 56s): It's also worth mentioning, I think, in this paper for highly analytical geometry nerds that you and your team ran into a bit of a challenge which is that you're filming this in the photospheres that you get from these cameras. It's like the same thing you you're dealing with map projections, you have to take these spheres and then flatten them and then correlate that. So can you talk a little bit about the artifacts of this and how your team addressed this potential source of error in the three-dimensional models? You were building of these swarms.Orit Peleg (47m 31s): The idea of 3d reconstruction. So X estimating depths from StereoVision is not new, and it hasn't been solved many times between you had this wheel, basically working with a periodic image on both the rotation angles. So we had to take this into account and adjust all the mathematical formulation to the depths estimation. And there's of course, a little bit of caveats when you are right underneath the camera, but otherwise you can really think about it as a stereo reconstruction, just with a more wider field of view, Michael Garfield (48m 12s): You took this, and then you compared what you were observing in the wild to, again, this is like one of these, like you get to mess with bugs and mess with their heads for a living, which is just amusing to me for some reason, I guess, it's distant enough. The section where you're isolating male fireflies and you're throwing them into tents and you're measuring what one does in isolation, and then you're, you're controlling it. You're adding them incrementally. And this is another instance where you see a transition as the number of fireflies goes up. What did you see here? It seems like this is another instance of somewhat similar dynamics to what we're seeing in bee coordination. Orit Peleg (48m 55s): You're right. It's all faced transitions. You're right. Thank you for finding a connecting theme. It's always hard for me to do actually from my own research, but you're right. There's definitely a phase transition here. The reason we worked with the tents in the first place is that the swarm is really big. So it spends miles over miles. We've never really seen the end of the swarm. So we can really just record a small fraction of it. We really want to have a situation where we know how many firefights we have and what is their field of view and what they are perceiving. And that was a bit harder to do of course outside in the natural environment. So for that, we just brought in dark tents that were served as a controlled environment where we could isolate a few flies from the swamp and bring them into this controlled environment. I guess the really surprising thing that we found is that as we decrease the number of fireflies that we have in that isolated environment, the synchronization becomes less well-formed to the point where we have individual fireflies. There's almost nothing periodic about the way that they flush. So if you look at the time between the start of the flash burst, then it spends a really wide distribution. And that's surprising because again, as I mentioned, I kind of grew up on these beautiful ideas and mathematical models that assume that an individual building blocks in these agent-based models also behave like an oscillator. Also performs a periodic function when it's by itself, isolated from the swarm. And we saw that this is not exactly what the fireflies are doing. Michael Garfield (50m 39s): This kind of reminds me of the conversation around neurodiversity. And I have a friend from college who used to say, "no man is an Island, but some are very long peninsulas." And just this notion that again, like there's to look at it in a more of a social scale, SFI prides itself on having distance enough from the larger academic environment and staying small enough that it can be weird. This comports with the experience that I remember as a child of seeing these beautiful swarms of synchronized fireflies catching one in a jar, and then being completely unable to predict when it's going to flash. I'm thinking about this now also in terms of the effects of remote work on professional existence, and just how weird and divergent people get when we're isolated from one another. And we're just sort of allowed to, you know, this is actually, obviously, this is like one of the fundamentals of science as it's practiced in a social context which is that we keep each other in check we're cuing off of each other. We're sinking up in ways that we don't when we go camping. And I mean, arguably that's really good for some reasons. So this is where we get into this thing about, you see this in the experiment you saw in your controls, that there were early flashers, mobile flashers. And again, I'm kind of thinking about that natural variation in the honeybees and the variation in risk tolerance and all of that. So it just interesting how even here in a system where it seems like there's much more regimented coordination between members of this collective, that you still see this sort of emergence of different personality types and like early adopters, the ones that like hang out and stay put. Orit Peleg (52m 32s): I thought it was a really interesting way to put this behavior of the fireflies in isolation. And I can definitely relate to, you know, becoming weirder in isolation. Michael Garfield (52m 42s): I mean, maybe this seems like the right place to talk about the last piece that you sent me, which again, this is, you know, you're the last author on a piece with Raphael Sarfati and Julie Hayes. So this is like a little subset of that research team, continuing investigation of this phenomenon, the relationship between the density and the correlation of fireflies. One of the things that comes out of this is just the importance of the environment in shaping self-organization and collective behavior, which I think has been a strain through the entire conversation. But I would love to just invite some remarks on this piece and how this piece sort of deepens and expands on the insights of the prior one.  Orit Peleg (53m 26s): This piece is just focusing on the fireflies outside in the forest, in the natural environment. And there is something that we were able to capture a little bit with our cameras it's of course, much more. It's just amazing to be there and see live. So there's this way of the onset of a burst that propagates throughout the entire forest. And you can really see it coming towards you in the forest. And it's really magnificent. We're able to direct our cameras in a direction that actually captured some of these propagating waves and also get some statistics on other directions. This is again where quantitative data becomes really useful. We are not the first one to discover this. This has been discovered before, but the tool that we have today, the researchers did before is that one researcher sued a hundred meters away from the other researcher. And then they just shouted whenever the wave got to their point and they kind of measured it this way. But now we're all doing the best we can do in the given technology that we have. And now we can actually capture and do the 3d reconstruction of these propagating waves. Propagating waves, of course, tells us something about the mechanisms of synchronization and how information is transferred between individuals. So it's a very interesting and important quality to have. What we found out in this paper is that the speed of the wave that is propagating is order of magnitude faster than the speed of which individuals are flying. So this has to come from some interactions between individuals and triggering of the flashing behavior based on the flashings of other individuals. And another important thing that we found out is that these, all of these synchronization and wave propagation occurs inside very dense vegetation. So those trees and those bushes and the fireflies just kind of move around them. And we were able to capture with the 360 cameras, the wrecking of symmetry in terms of the directionality. So if you put them in different points, there's going to be certain directions in which we will see more flashes in comparison to other directions. And that's really just coming from the visual occlusion that is there in the environment. This paper is really just highlighting the importance of considering the environment and the conductivity of the network of interactions, how it affects that network when thinking about the synchronization of the entire swarm. Michael Garfield (55m 59s): And the conclusion to this piece, talking about the result mixture of short range and long range interactions, you make an interesting point here, which I think we just spoke to really, which was that this self-organization allows for the possibility of an individual to position itself, to be more or less connected by flying higher from the ground, lower to the ground. They have some ability to modify the line of sight or like the wavelength. If I'm getting this right, this kind of reminds me of, again, diversity within various societies and various animal species of spy hopping behavior in whales may be, might be an example, or the loaner weirdos that wander off. You would ask yourself, if being a social organism, like a chimpanzee is so valuable, why do you have these individuals that wander off? Again, it speaks to the way that variation within a given population allows for cohesion. The fact that this is all occurring within a mating context, it's funny because you think if people are competing for mates, why would they copy each other? Orit Peleg (57m 13s): Let me just throw out like a teaser that's possible in the first paper that came out in the fireflies. We did find out that there is, even though the firefighters are synchronizing, their flashes there's actually importance to the movement. So they're kind of drawing a flash as they move. And that kind of shape actually has some influence on the synchronization of the entire swarm could also be, this is just speculation, but could also have some influence also on what, not just the males are perceiving, but maybe what also the females are proceeding. It's a really interesting question of how do you the male fireflies distinguish yourself from the rest of the swarm while still getting the attention of the females that we already know from the literature that they are responding to more punctual swarms. So it's a very hard problem to solve. And this is kind of a future direction that we're taking this in my life. Michael Garfield (58m 12s): It stands to reason I think that answering this question will help us or could help us understand how to allocate science funding a little bit more effectively? How to distribute money to these sort of large projects that are occurring within a given paradigm. And then like how much money we as a society should consider giving to the crazy ones that wander off. Orit Peleg (58m 44s): It was up to me. It would be just the crazy ones, but that's the whole different story. Michael Garfield (58m 49s): You then don't get any synchrony. In closing, what would you, as someone who has a clear and infectious enthusiasm for this world and these ideas and research methods, what would you suggest to people that are looking to get more involved in the study of collective behavior or the properties of complex systems? I mean, obviously like join your lab, right? Orit Peleg (59m 18s): Joining the lab or taking some of the nice courses SFI is offering. That would be my first guest besides this. I would recommend being in nature, observing these animals in real life or watching nature documentaries. If you can't do that reading popular science books has been a really major inspiration for me. It's like discovering whole new worlds, you know, all these weird animals and weird behaviors. And kind of that always brings a question of why aren't you doing that? And what happens if you tweak the behavior slightly that way? So that's kind of what I recommend people, nature movies that seems like a fabulous place to ground this a little concrete. Get outside. Michael Garfield: Orit, this has been an absolute pleasure. Orit Peleg: Thank you so much. Again, it's such an honor to be on the show and I really enjoy it. Michael Garfield (1h 0m 33s): Thank you for listening.

58,Episode Details / Transcript Transcript generated by machine at podscribe.ai and edited by Aaron Leventman. Sidney Redner (0s): There's a very famous saying, which has been attributed to Einstein, but apparently it was not his saying, which is that a model should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. I try and live in that space of the model should be as simple as possible, but no simpler so that we capture some of the collective behavior that one might see in a complex system. Like where should you park your car? Or what is the length of winning streaks of a baseball team?  But all these other thing, maybe some people like to park in the shade. Maybe some people want to get a bit more exercise. These are like complications that in principle, I know the tools of how you might deal with it, but it then loses the simplicity and the beauty of like a clean solution.  Engineers have to worry about real world problems. They have a real parking lot with a real traffic pattern in it. And then you have to worry about all of these microscopic details. But I think that those microscopic details are a way that you then lose the forest through the trees. And so I'm trying to look at the forest, the big picture, rather than each individual tree.  Complexity is all around us, in the path we walk through pathless woods, the strategies we used to park our cars, the dynamics of an elevator as it cycles up and down a building. Zoom out far enough in the phenomena of everyday existence. Start revealing, hidden links, suggesting underlying universal patterns at great theoretic heights. It all yields to statistical analysis, winning streaks and traffic jams, card games and elevators boiling down complicated real world situations into elegant toy model. Physicists derived, mathematical descriptions that transcend mundane particulars, helping us see daily life with fresh new eyes. Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks, to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. In this episode, we speak to SFI resident, professor Sydney Redner author of A Guide to First Passage Processes about how he finds inspiration for his complex systems research in the everyday and how he uses math and physics to explore hot hands, heat waves, parking lots and more. If you value our research and communication efforts, please rate and review us @applepodcasts and/or consider making a donation at santafe.edu/podcast.

All right.  Michael Garfield (3m 1s): Sydney Redner, it's a pleasure to have you on complexity podcast. Sidney Redner (3m 4s): I'm glad to be here.  Michael Garfield (3m 6s): As we typically do on this show, I'd like to start by inviting you to talk a little bit about your early years and what got you into science in the first place and how you were animated to become a physicist. What burning questions drove you into it and who helped you along the way?Sidney Redner (3m 30s): That's an interesting question. First of all, ever since I was a little kid, I knew I wanted to be a physicist. I mean, my mother's a Holocaust survivor. My dad is a Holocaust escapee. They came to the United States and then to Canada with no education. They didn't understand anything about science or anything like that. But somehow I remember when I was about six years old, they bought me a book. It was called the Golden Book of Mathematics and I was hooked. I was just simply hooked. And so I knew right from the very get-go that I wanted to be a scientist. Michael Garfield (3m 60s): So how did you decide to pursue the trajectory that you have pursued in your career as far as like a research topics? Because it seems like a lot of your work as we'll discuss in this episode focuses on a very particular approach to thinking about stochastic processes. And obviously this has very wide applications, but it's a very narrow focus and maybe it's worth defining some of these core concepts here too. SidneyRedner (4m 28s): First of all, I followed a trajectory, which I think is very common among physics graduate students, which is that when I was first learning about physics at a dilettante level, I learned about relativity and high-energy physics. And I thought, well, that's the most pure, the most fundamental that's what I'm going to do. And that fantasy lasted until about my first year of graduate school. And I realized it's not really what it's all cracked up to be and there's a whole other world out there in other fields of physics. When you're a pine geophysicist, you think everything else is kind of like squalid state physics, according to, I guess Marie Gillmann, but there's just so many beautiful problems out there. And I actually sort of fell into statistical physics, which is formerly the field of physics I work in. I kind of fell into it almost by accident, but once I fell into it, there's a certain intrinsic beauty because statistical physics is both nowhere and everywhere at the same time in the sense that there's no like division of statistical physics in the American physical society, but statistical physics underlies the reasoning that people use to understand all kinds of systems because as soon as you have many particles or many degrees of freedom, you can never hope to understand the microscopic motion of every single particle. For example, like the weather. You can't follow the motion of every single molecule in the atmosphere and figure out the weather that's just hopeless. And so one has to develop statistical methods to describe these sorts of systems in a statistical way, rather than a deterministic way. And that kind of reasoning just resonates with me all the time. Michael Garfield (5m 58s): It strikes me that your own career is actually a good example of your domain of research and that you kind of applied a random walk through physics until you like landed somewhere. Sidney Redner (6m 10s): I guess my choice of research topics has been more eclectic than the average person. I generally have not worked with real experimental data. There are some theorists who say, “let me look at the data of this scattering experiment and try and understand the interactions and try and make some predictions about some material.” I do work with data at certain times, but I'm just sort of like looking at my window right now and looking at the leaves shaking and thinking about birds landing on the tree and like how far apart they're going to be spaced and all that. I see, like the world around me is just full of beautiful examples of statistical phenomena that I like to try and model and formalize and try and solve. Michael Garfield (6m 51s): So while you were a professor at Boston University, you wrote a textbook called a Guide to First Passage Processes. And because this is a concept that has bearing on so much of what we're going to talk about today, I'd like for you to just introduce this concept and explain why it is so fundamental and so illuminating to so many different areas of inquiry. Sidney Redner (7m 14s): So first passage processes is kind of a subset of the whole universe of random walks. So the first thing is that there are many processes in nature that described by a random walk. Maybe you've heard about a random walk down Wall Street. Stock prices move in a stochastic manner. And one might try to model that by random walk. And then there's something called stock options where if a stock hits a certain price by a certain date, something happens. So oftentimes you're interested in when a random walk first reaches a threshold level. So the stock option is a typical example of that. Another example is integrating fire neurons in the brain. You have neurons that are farming the brain all the time. There's this threshold voltage. And every time a neuron fires, it sends currents to neighboring neurons. And so the voltage level on a given neuron is fluctuating randomly with time. But when it reaches a certain threshold level, it fires and sends signals somewhere else in the brain. And that's basically how the brain works. It's just this cacophony of firing of neurons all the time, but they're all driven by this underlying first passage process where a voltage has to reach a certain threshold level before it fires. And the voltage level is gradually rising, but rising in a fluctuating way. Michael Garfield (8m 28s): This would also apply then to diffusion based processes like circulating oxygen through a body, specifically like the transition between passive oxygen diffusion to an active pump circulation. We're talking about this with Geoffrey West, talking about the emergence of the circulatory system or talking with Brian Arthur about the emergence of active initiatives to redistribute wealth in society as society scales. That all depends on first passage resetting and how long it actually is going to take a given oxygen molecule to make it from outside to the inside of an organism. Am I getting that right? Sidney Redner (9m 6s): Well, you've got pieces of that, certainly correct. The place where I think that first passage processes are still like yet to be fully developed is understanding physiological processes. And so the question that you were asking, like if you take a random oxygen molecule, how long does it take before it binds to a cell, then it gets transported inside the body? How long does it take? I mean, that is an example of a first passage process, but it's not just pure diffusion because you know, you're breathing in. And so there's convection, there's turbulent flow. There's all kinds of other things going on. But nevertheless, one is interested in like how long does it take for like oxygen to get into yourselves? Michael Garfield (9m 41s): Let's make it a bit simpler as you do very well in some of your papers, creating these toy models of traffic and parking and so on. And let's start with this paper that you co-authored with Ben-NaimandKrapivskyon traffic, on kinetics, clustering and traffic flows. So could you walk us through how you built this model? Sidney Redner (10m 5s): First of all, it's something that we've all seen on a two-lane highway when you're trying to pass and you can't pass cause there's traffic coming the other way. You pile up behind a slower car. And in fact, this actually has an amusing backstory because when my kids were about eight and five, I thought we should go to Cape Cod for vacation. So we're driving down the Southeast expressway, then there's highway three to get to Cape Cod. And at some point you go across the bridge and you're on Cape Cod and it's a four lane highway that suddenly changed the two lanes. And if you know anything about Boston, you think the infrastructure is always messed up. “Oh, this must be a mistake. They're under construction.” No, it's not a mistake. There's a 13 mile stretch called suicide alley where the four lane road turns to two lane road and passing is definitely not allowed. There's a little bollards in the road. And so I remember thinking, “Damn it, it's going to take us forever to get to Cape Cod.” But I notice it is we're entering suicide alley. There's cars coming in the opposite direction, like every second. And then after a while there's a huge gap. And for two minutes, no car is passing me and then another huge cluster. Every car passing once a cycle. And finally, when they get to the far end of suicide alley I realize there's no more large clusters. There's just cars coming, randomly entering the road. And so it hit me like a bomb, of course, all is happening is that cars that are faster than the average are getting stuck behind a cluster. And we can understand that mathematically and I have the tools about how to treat it mathematically. And so, bingo, that was the start of a paper on traffic clustering and one dimensional flows. Michael Garfield (11m 41s): Yeah. I think it's key in this piece, as in the piece on parking for the sake of simplicity, you're reducing it to that one-dimensional traffic flow. Sidney Redner (11m 50s): The point is that nature in that particular case was exactly one-dimensional flow. Michael Garfield (11m 54s): So this is actually a rather detailed model. You're assuming a power law behavior? Sidney Redner (12m 0s): It doesn't really assume very much in the sense that like to make the basic theory. All you need is that there's a distribution of intrinsic speeds for each car. Like a little old lady might drive a little slower than the average and aggressive young man might drive faster than the average. All you need is a distribution of velocities. And so you start with cars flowing on a one dimensional line each with their own intrinsic velocity and then one just follows what happens. And so like have a faster car catches up to a slower car now you have a cluster of size two. Maybe this cluster of size to catch us up to an even slower car. And you got a cluster of size three and then this clustering just continues ad infinitum. And so the actual basic phenomenology doesn't depend on the distribution of intrinsic speeds. It turns out that if you choose a particular form for that intrinsic distribution, you can solve it. It makes pretty formulas. But that's almost irrelevant. The fact that there's just a distribution of speeds is the main point. Michael Garfield (12m 53s): And so it seems like you can draw from this an illuminating analogy to some other one dimensional flows. Like where else do you notice, where do you observe this kind of behavior outside of traffic? And then maybe like a B part to that question would be, did you find it in doing this work that you gained any insight into what could be done to kind of counter this? Is there a way to unstick or prevent traffic jams by regulating on-ramp like you see in Los Angeles, like some effort in this direction, but that doesn't actually account for the tiny variations once you get on the highway. So that's an A and a B. Sidney Redner (13m 31s): Let me answer the B first. I think I have a reasonable answer for that, which is that if you have a one-dimensional road with only a single lane of traffic, of course, it's going to strongly cluster. And you know, there are places where maybe there's a broken line in the center and you can pass, but it's still pretty restricted. But a thing that you can do in which a lot of places do in rural areas is that you just make a third passing lane every once in a while. And so an interesting question then is if you want to minimize the cost by building more third passing lanes, but you want to maximize traffic flow, what should you do? That sounds like actually an interesting optimization problem that I've not really thought about. Michael Garfield (14m 7s): That seems related to this other issue that comes up a lot in complex systems research, which is the trade-offs between the efficiencies of an economy of scale and the resilience or adaptability of so-called inefficient systems. Every one of those little turnoffs is an additional investment in the infrastructure that would seem to like a first layer of analysis to be a waste of money. But here you're saying actually if you embedded in a larger consideration, then it may actually be saving us time and money, Sidney Redner (14m 42s): You invest money to build the passing lane. But on the other hand, the people save a certain amount of time and time is money then there is some optimization calculation one could formulate. Michael Garfield (14m 53s): So maybe this isn't the right piece to tackle next. We're not taking this in chronological order, but I did just read the paper that you did with Sarah Fang on elevators. And this seems again, related to a very tiny piece of a very in-depth paper that the two of you wrote on how long you're going to sit there in the lobby, waiting for an elevator to arrive. And the question of how many elevators a given building should have in order to minimize waiting time. Again, I think the real world motivation for this piece should be fairly self-evident, but I'd love to hear a bit of the backstory on this and then how the two of you broke down this problem and actually attacked it. Sidney Redner (15m 31s): I guess the other thing is that we're living in an increasingly crowded world. Not so much in Santa Fe, but when I was living in Boston, you always have to worry where could you park your car? Did you have to avoid driving here at this time of day because you wouldn't find a place to park. And if you went to the movie at 9: 30, it was overcrowded and you wouldn't get in. So I mean, there's always lots of phenomenology involving crowding. And so I've always been interested in examples where you have crowding, you know, so it happens when you try and board or get off an airplane. It happens when you go into the lobby of a building. It's everywhere. So, you know, Sarah came as an undergraduate research for experience for undergraduate student. We were just talking like, what could we work on that one could finish in a summer, which we never did finish in the summer. I don't know how it came up. I'm an impatient person. I might've said, “Damn it. I waited like 10 minutes for something or other.” And so somehow we hit upon thinking about waiting in an elevator because everybody does it and everybody probably feels a little bit frustrated about it. I thought, well, we could perhaps mathematize it. And you know, the way we mathematize it as a way like any self-respecting physicist does, which is you first start with a spherical cap approximation. And so the spherical cap approximation for an elevator would be one elevator that has infinite capacity because then when the elevator comes, nobody's like left behind. So it simplifies mathematics and that turned out to be easy to solve. And then it sort of led us to think about a finite capacity elevator and then multiple elevators is the natural progression starting with something so idealized that it's not relevant to the real world, but it provides you an insight to how to then deal with the more realistic cases of finite capacity elevator and multiple elevators. Michael Garfield (17m 18s): One of the things that I know appeals to many, many people in the complex system enthusiast world is this question of synchronization. I just had a conversation with Orit Peleg about Firefly synchronization. And I think this is a really nice sort of place to expand on the traffic jam and crowding element from the one lane road example, to talk about how, even if you only have one elevator per track that you still end up with synchronization. Could you talk a little bit about that because it took me a little time to wrap my head around how you would still end up with these situations where you get traffic jams, even with a bunch of independent elevator cars. ·       Sidney Redner (18m 2s): The point is that even though their trajectories are independent, the loading process makes them highly correlated. It's easier to understand from the framework of thinking about a bus route model, because in fact, part of the inspiration for this, there was a very beautiful paper, maybe about 30 years ago, I forget now, about the one-dimensional bus route model. And in that model, you imagine you have a bus route which has a circular loop, and there's a number of buses going around the loop and there's equally space stations and passengers arrive at random at the various bus stops. A random number of passengers get off at each stop. And the point is that in this one-dimensional world, if by some bad luck, there's more passengers waiting at a stop than average, the bus that stopped at the stop takes longer to pick up the passengers and the bus behind will catch up. And when it gets to the stop where the bus took longer than average, there's typically fewer than average people waiting because the next bus is started to catch up. So there's a smaller time gap. And so that instability just feeds on itself because the second bus is picked up fewer passengers so it takes less time at that one bad stop. This instability just builds and builds. And so the same kind of thing happens in the elevator situation. It's just that instead of having, there's stops along the floors, but then there's a long stop at the lobby. And it's the long stop at the lobby where if there's more passengers than average, then that one elevator is spending a long time waiting. And so there's more time for the next elevator to come to the lobby and catch up to the elevator that's loading up to capacity. And by the time it leaves, maybe there's fewer passengers waiting and the next elevator can pick them up quickly. And if it's behind, then it can catch up to the elevator that's ahead of it. Michael Garfield (19m 45s): It feels to me like there might be some insight from this that you could apply to like HR practices or like the org chart, where especially with smaller organizations, you end up with all of these bottlenecks where one particular duty falls on one person. But then even as the organization scales and you move from like a one elevator model to multiple people that could be answering the same inbox, you can still end up in these jams where you think you're creating a bit more like resilience against this kind of thing by hiring additional people into a particular function, but it doesn't actually solve the problem. Sidney Redner (20m 25s): I haven't thought like along those lines, as I'm more interested in like concrete models, but that's an interesting thought. Michael Garfield (20m 33s): Well, moving on in a kind of random walk through your papers, you have one here that again, I think has a real relatable origin story. This piece you did with Ben-Naim onwinning and dirty, the greedy random walk. I'd love to hear you elaborate on this one next, if you could. Sidney Redner (20m 53s): This is based on the children's game of war. For those who have never played war it's about as simple as simple can be. You just take a deck of cards, these divided into you each turn up one card at a time face up and whoever has a higher value card takes both cards. And then there's one other twist to the model, which is that if you both turn up a card, which has the same value, then you're supposed to put down three more cards and turn up another card. And it's called a war because it's more costly for the person who loses. And so when the next card is turned up, whoever has the highest card wins. And so it's kind of like a random walk process because if you look at the number of cards that anybody has, it goes up by one or down by one, or maybe it goes up by plus or minus four after you play a war. And so if you just think about a random walk with 52 cards, and when somebody has all 52 cards, the game is over, you can calculate how long it's going to take on average for this game to last. It takes a long time. I mean, especially if you're playing with a four-year-old son who really likes to play war and it's sort of past bedtime and you're tired and you've got things you've got to do as well. And so I thought to myself at some point I have a great idea “Gabe let's make it every time a war let's make it even bigger.” And so of course, being a four-year-old kid, he was really enthused about that. Let's have Mega Wars. And so like the first war, you put three additional cars and turn up the fourth card. The next one, you put four cards down to turn up the next card. So that was the game of war that it came up with and it had the incredible benefit that it's over with quickly. And so the paper that we wrote was just the actual study of like how much quicker that game is compared to normal war. And I was happy when I thought about it because Gabe was happy. The main thing is you want your kid to be happy. So he was happy to play these Mega War games, but I was happy because the game took less time. So win-win situation. Michael Garfield (22m 44s): Well, the fact that you use the card game war, as an example here, I think begs, you know, follow up question about real-world arms races and like James P. Carse's book, Finite and Infinite Games. You're trying to win over a given limited resource, say that's the finite game. That's different from a situation in which you're trying to keep the game going for as long as possible. Maybe another link to this would be when Geoff West talks about the finite time singularity about how like a city gets itself stuck in this ratchet where it's constantly bringing crises upon itself faster and faster and has to innovate faster and faster has to make these innovative leaps at an ever-shrinking timescale. So what do you think that this model suggests about preventing a kind of a super war situation in which the goal is not to end the game as quickly as possible, but to keep it going as long as possible. Is there an intervention that this math suggests? Sidney Redner (23m 49s): The simplest way to make the game last a long time is that if somebody has an advantage that somehow you provide a handicap, so the probability of the person who's advantage probably of him or her winning the next game is lessened. The one thing which I haven't thought about that seriously, but it's also interesting is that when you started with the game of war, you think the value of the cards of each player are roughly the same on average. As the game progresses, the one who's got more cards typically has more high value cards. So the way to make the game last longer is you handicap based on your higher value cards the way the game is actually played. Roughly speaking, what it means is that when you have a random walk, you have a bias, that's driving it back towards the origin. Every time you like make an excursion to the right, you have a bias pushing it to the left and vice versa. Michael Garfield (24m 37s): This seems related to the shelling segregation model and this notion that you actually have to actively compensate for people's desire to affiliate with people like themselves in order to maintain some heterogeneity in society. It seems like kind of the same thing cut at from a 90-degree angle. Sidney Redner (24m 57s): At some level there is some commonality. I mean the Shelley model is extremely simple and extremely beautiful and it shows that if you just prefer people of your own type, but don't discriminate against the opposite type to still naturally to segregation. So there is this organization that's happening from a more or less random process. Michael Garfield (25m 15s): Maybe the analogy would be something like that. The benefits of associating with your own kind of person are kind of equivalent to the benefits of constantly upping the ante in a super war. You sort of race to the finish line with that approach. Again, to take a complete hairpin turn here, you've got a piece that you wrote with Mark Peterson on the role of global warming on the statistics of record-breaking temperatures. And this is a completely loose analogy, but in keeping with the race to the finish line here I would love to hear you introduce this paper. Sidney Redner (25m 55s): Well, actually this paper has a very amusing backstory because, you know, in the seventies I was really into running and running marathons and I really wanted to run the Boston Marathon. And in 1976, I was so ready. I was raring to go. I was going to run two 50 marathon and the day of the marathon, it was like 95 degrees. I couldn't believe it, just all that training going for nothing. Michael Garfield (26m 19s): And then about nine years later.Sidney Redner (26m 21s): I was giving a talk in Temple University and it was a colloquium in early Michael Garfield (26m 26s): April. Sidney Redner (26m 28s): And because I was invited by someone who was a former graduate student at Boston University, I stayed in his apartment. And that night it was 95 degrees, April 4th, I think 1985. And this is back in the days when you had transparencies. And so I was giving my colloquium, no air conditioning, because one turns it on in early April and I'm sweating into my transparencies and they're melting away before my eyes. It's like that bugged me the whole time. Why is it that the first heat wave is always sort of coincident with the Boston Marathon that stayed with me for like many years? I gotta be able to make a model of this. I gotta be able to mathematize it. And I tried very hard to get data. And I guess it was in 2004, I was at Los Alamos Labs as an alum scholar that year. And I had a running partner named Mark Peterson. And I remember telling him, I just got data for 150 years of Philadelphia high and low temperature for every day of the year. I'm going to analyze it and see what I can learn about it. And somehow in the course of that run, we sorta realized that if it's just, what's called IID Data, independent identically distributed random variables. So if I focus on one day of the year, the temperature on that one day of the year of it's an independent, random variable for that particular day, then we know something about how many record temperatures you should expect on that day. And for IID variables, it turns out the number of temperature records grows logarithmically in the amount of time that you've been actually keeping records. And so that was the thing. Could we then take this data and analyze it, look at the number of records for each day of the year, temperature records, and see if there's some hint of global warming. And so it turns out that for Philadelphia, the data was suggestive when not decisive, that is that we had more record temperatures than we would expect from just random IID variables, which suggested that global warming is actually affecting the number of record temperatures that you see. And subsequent to that there's a flood of data that became available. Before it was always behind paywalls and it was always hidden. And then I found data for like hundreds of cities around the world. and yes, you can see very clearly the effect of global warming and record temperatures, statistics. And, you know, like the average lay person, when it's a record high temperature, then people are always talking about what's global warming or it's not global warming. And it's fun to mathematize these basic questions and try and understand really what is the effect of global warming on record temperature statistics? Michael Garfield (28m 51s): You check these predictions, not only against temperature data, but also against Monte Carlo simulations. And just as a way of giving listeners a little nibbles, little insights, windows into the way that a physicist actually approaches these things and test themselves and does everything that they can not to fall prey to their own biases. I'd love to hear you talk a little bit about the simulation component of this. Sidney Redner (29m 19s): So the other thing is that at the time we did the study, we only had 130 years with the data, which is not a lot of data by like any astronomical standards. So certainly the other thing that was worth doing, and we did do is that we simulated a toy model of, you know, we took like the temperature statistics of Philadelphia. So we know the average temperature for each day of the year. We know the spread for each day of the year. And from that, we can build a model where we can simulate not hundreds of years of data, but tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years of data nd look at the record temperatures statistics for this synthetic data and compare it to what we really see. And so it provides kind of a clear window of the role of global warming on record temperature statistic because when you have tens of thousands of years of data, then you see much more clear signals than you would with just 130 or 140 years of data, which is what we actually had. Michael Garfield (30m 11s): Unless I'm misunderstanding this, you say here that your primary result is that we cannot yet distinguish between the effects of random fluctuations and long-term systematic trends on the frequency of record-breaking temperatures.Sidney Redner (30m 23s): But that’s only for the one case of Philadelphia and subsequent to our paper. I did find much more data. And then for longer time series, you really see clearly the effect of global warming and record temperature statistics. And other people have then done much more with much more comprehensive datasets. And then also the other thing is that focusing on record temperatures is like throwing away most of the data. And so there's actually more incisive ways of finding the canary in the coal mine. But I think that we sort of started a little bit of a cottage industry on this, but yes, we do see clearly, because the case that I found about six months later.I think I had 236 years of data and there it's just crystal clear. You can see the canary in the coal mine just by the record, temperatures statistics Michael Garfield (31m 8s): In the 15 years, since this paper has the growth in the signal here, you know, the statistical signal of increasing record temperature events. This is sort of a casual question. How serious does it seem to you at this point? Sidney Redner (31m 27s): I'm not a climatologist and I wouldn't want to try and stick my neck out on this one. But certainly in the United States, it's really clear that records are happening much more quickly now than they did 50 years ago or a hundred years ago. Again, it's just one of many possible signals of global warming and certainly what people pay much more attention to is not looking at records statistics, but average statistics over long periods of time and seeing a very slow, but systematic increase in average temperatures. Michael Garfield (31m 56s): So kind of adjacent to this in terms of thinking about taking enormous datasets and identifying statistical streaks in them, you've got the work that you did with sire on understanding baseball teams, standings, and streaks. And so this seems like you're applying a similar approach to actually determining whether or not this common apprehension that teams get on streaks and that streak has something to do with the team's ability is like whether that is just a statistical artifact or whether we're actually seeing something in the system itself that's torquing the results. Sidney Redner (32m 36s): And is that for that example of like baseball team winning, I used to know the data really well. I've now forgotten it, but I forget which team has a longest winning streak, but the question was, is this something which has really fluky or is this something that one can understand in a clean and simple way? And the answer at least I believe is that you can understand it in a very clean and simple way. One might say, well, if you're on a streak, you feel hot. You really macho, you intimidate the other team. The other team is a little bit intimidated. And so it feeds on itself. And in fact, the data at the beginning is suggestive because if teams were all equally strong and there was no systematic effects or no intimidation or anything like that, then the length of a streak should have the probability that you have a winning streak of end games should be equal to two to the minus end because half the time you win half the time you lose. So the proper that you have a two game winning streak is one half squared, a three game winning streak is one half cube. And so that's, what's called exponential dependence on the length of the streak. And if you look at the data, normally what we do and we have data which like decays exponentially with time, you plot it on a logarithmic scale and it looks like a straight line on a logarithmic scale and the data was curved upwards. So it looked like no, there's something really unusual going on because of the fact that it wasn't an exponential. And it turns out that what that apparent curvature is, is actually a finite end effect for one thing. And the other mechanism for it is the fact that the teams are not all equally strong. So if you include the fact that the teams are different strengths and work through all the mathematics, you can actually predict the length of the winning streaks as a function of the heterogeneity and the team strengths. And so we came up with a very simple description, statistically, of team strength as a function of the number of wins at the end of a season, from which we can infer then the relative strength of teams from which we can then compute the length of winning streaks for like a set of heterogeneous opponents. And then we find a very good match between the theory and the data. So there was no intimidation effect. There was no feeding on itself. It was just simple, random statistics. Michael Garfield (34m 47s): However, you took this data set and you cut it in half. So you've got 1901 to 1960 and then 1961 to 2005 and things look different after 1961. So what's going on there? Sidney Redner (35m 0s): This also comes to like the question about basketball as well, but the point here is that we're living in a competitive society. People want to get ahead and, you know, baseball is kind of a magnification of the competitive society because the whole point of baseball is winning games. And so if anybody has a competitive advantage, then the other teams will try and figure out what it is to arbitrage it away. And in the early days of baseball, when baseball players didn't earn a lot of money and you had to have a second job and people didn't have a lot of time to watch baseball games, the intensity of the competition was not at the same level as it is now, where you have, a team will have a masseuse, a psychological coach nutrition coach. They're trying to optimize the performance of every single player as best as possible. And so one sees that in the fact that I'm in the period, what we call the classic period of baseball, which is 1911 to 1960, when they all played 154 game series, that the difference between the best team and the worst team was that the best team would typically win two thirds of all games and the worst team would win one third of all games. After 1961, the best team typically wins. And I forget now the numbers because I don't. I've forgotten the details, but it's just that the spread between the best and the worst teams has gotten systematically smaller. And so that effect is just that the very worst players on the worst teams now are much better than the worst players in the worst teams a hundred years ago, because they're all very well-trained, they have good nutrition. It just like reduces the disparity between the best and the worst. Michael Garfield (36m 32s): This seems related to questions about the scale of competition in other areas. For example, the superstar effect with like YouTube and how competing on a global stage has changed things for say, I look at like on avant garde acoustic guitarists online, and you see that over the last 15 years, this global arena for competition has yanked everyone up to a certain level of performance, but also diminished the variety, the heterogeneity of players. In some respect, they've sort of focused on trying to optimize for a particular audience. Doug Guilbeault, the 2019 CSS alum that just gave a seminar on the convergence of novel categories and how like the larger a society gets, he was doing like a Rorschach thing. And having people like try to agree on what shape that particular item is, that image. And then as the society gets larger, people are more and more likely to converge on categories. And he was comparing it to the way that you see genetic drift can push a mutation that has no benefit into saturating an Island population, but then it just gets lost in the noise on the mainland.  There's all of these ways that it seems like your research is also pointing to how scale induced competition drives convergence and how even if we're on average, getting more and more competitive, you know, within a given sort of domain that we may also be losing variety. If there were more than just that one degree of optimization for winning major league baseball games that this evolutionary arms race is going to eventually undermine itself. Sidney Redner (38m 24s): That's certainly an interesting point. And if I think about like professional sports let me compare Canadian football league because I'm Canadian with the NFL and Canadian football has a much lower level of competition, but it also has a much wider spread. The very best players in the CFL are good enough to be in the NFL. The worst players in the CFL have no business being on the field almost, and the games are more wacky there. They're just wackier. It's also the same. You've seen college football, like the first week of the season you'll have like Texas playing some Podunk University and the game is like 72 to 3 or something like that. So when there is this disparity in the competition, then you have a wider spread of outcomes and also perhaps more wacky and more entertaining. But as you get like to the very top level of competition, it's like everybody looks the same. They're all ferociously built. They're all monster athletes and they all do the same thing. It seems at some level, a little bit more dull. Michael Garfield (39m 20s): So this is related to another piece when you're talking about like winning streaks and losing streaks, but outside of the context of competitive sports, per se, you have a piece, a fresh look at the hot hand paradox. That's looking at this like purely within a series of point flips and you get some results that on the first pass would almost seem to contradict your findings in baseball. Sid Redner (39m 47s): That's probably a more idiosyncratic piece of work because it's like very specialized and it has this weird feature of what's called the hot hand paradox, which is that if you flip a coin and it's a fair coin and you're flipping either heads or tails, and the question is, how long do you have to wait before you get to say, a particular sequence, like three heads in a row versus head tail head. If the coin flip is entirely it's fair and uncorrelated to get three heads in a row. Well, that's like each outcome is a probability one half. And so you should say, well, it's one half cube. That's one eighth. So you say eight time steps. You should see something like three hits in a row. But it turns out that the sequence heads, heads, heads, heads, tails, heads have different waiting times to actually see them. And it's kind of a particularist phenomenon. It doesn't really refer to like real sports or anything like that. It's just a quirk of the coin flipping situation that I'm not really prepared extemporaneously to give like a really good intuitive answer for why that is. I mean, if you gave me 10 minutes, I'd work it out again because it's one of those things that it's so non-intuitive, that seems unbelievable. But then like I work it out and, here it is. And here's why it is, but it's like, because I don't work in that area. It's like not something I'm on top of right this second. Michael Garfield (41m 3s): So you've brought up hot hand elsewhere. You brought it up in your work on basketball scoring. You've got a piece on this that you wrote with Alan Gabel. Is there evidence of hot hand as a valid phenomenon and when you are actually looking at this sort of high dimensional? Sidney Redner (41m 22s): Well, I mean, let me talk a little bit about basketball and by the way, there's a second paper with Aaron Clauset I'm Marina Kogan. But the point here is that just as we were talking before, about as the level of competition increases, you lose any systematic advantage. So like if you think about the NBA, every single player in the NBA is an amazing athlete that they do things that I can only dream about. And so the worst player on the worst team in the NBA is still a fantastic athlete. And also the worst team can be the best team at any given day of the year. And so the argument that we were coming up with is that any systematic advantage has been arbitraged away because everybody has the same training methods. They're all very well coached, whatever. And so it's really the outcome of a random walk. And so we wanted to try and test whether or not one could describe basketball scoring event by event. It's just like repeated flippings of a coin. And the answer was, yes, we can actually model really beautifully and precisely. With a zero-parameter fit we can fit the scoring data of NBA basketball games to just a simple one-dimensional, random walk or repeated coin flips. Michael Garfield (42m 29s): Again, we're just taking hairpin turns through your work here, but I wanted to hairpin next into citation statistics from 110 years of physical review, because to the extent that we can start thinking about the intense competition in sports or in the global entertainment industry, there's also really intense competition and situations of like preferential attachment in science and in the citation of scientific papers and you know, how it is that a paper gets noticed. And you wrote this piece, looking at the statistics of the history of physics publications and finding that some of the most important papers just sort of slept dormant for years before they were recognized. So I'd love to know how you approached this particular study and then how you see it as linking into some of the other topics and insights that we've discussed in this episode so far. Sidney Redner (43m 32s): It comes down to looking through the world through statistical eyes. So somewhere in the nineties, and before that, how did scientists get tenure for example? You would have to go to the library, go to this book called the science citation index. You'd have to look at how many times your papers were cited, and then you would put it in your CV. And then you'd say, give me tenure, because I've been cited like, 1000 times or something like that. And then somewhere in the 1990s, the data has started becoming available electronically. And then, it opened it up for every, anyone could play with the data. And so somehow there was this list that was circulating around of like well-known physicists and how many times they've been cited. And it just can't any immediately. Well, I should look at the distribution of the number of citations. And so I saw that it was heavy tailed and there was another person who was also working on the same data set. We had competing papers appearing at the same time. And then it turns out there was also data about the internet itself and like essentially the spatial structure of internet, like what is the number of links between nodes on the internet. And that also seemed to have a heavy tail. And so that's where Barabasi got the idea of this preferential attachment notion and he was justifiably very famous for coming up with this. It turns out that that model was actually first solved by a guy named Herbert Simon in 55. But leaving that aside, the point is that, you know, scientists care about how often they're cited and then it's very natural to try and systematize those studies and understand what is the probability that a paper of mine is going to get cited. How many times am I cited? Where do I fit in the grand scheme of all physicists and why a well cited physicists are my poorly cited physicist. Lots of people that have been looking at systematics of this kind of data. But one thing that we did do that I think was really a lot of fun and taught us a lot was using the Google page rank algorithm itself to then try and classify papers. So, you know, everybody uses Google all the time and the basic Google page rank algorithm is simple. As simple can be. It's basically a random walk algorithm. And so the idea is that you have the worldwide web, you have a whole bunch of websites. And a lot of the traffic on websites are robots that are just robots, going around, mapping out where they are. So the basic Google page range algorithm itself, you sent a whole bunch of robots out on the worldwide web, and you just go from one link to another. And every once in a while, you just say, I'm going to go randomly anywhere that's called teleportation. And then you'd look at the distribution of where the robots are as a function of time. And it turns out that popular websites are highly cited papers will have a lot of robots on them and you just order the sites by the number of robots on them. And that's basically what Google page rank did in its early days. So we applied that same algorithm to the citation graph. So what we imagine now is that you have scientific papers, they cite other papers, and links between papers are the citations. And we just put random walkers on this citation graph and let them run around to nearest neighbors. But every once in a while, we just say teleport anywhere else on the graph. And the reason you do teleportation is that you could have some sinks in the graph where like you get stuck forever because there's no way out. You have only in-links, but no openings. So teleportation is actually a necessary feature of trying to make a sensible measurement. And so it turns out that by using this Google page track algorithm on the citation network, we could then identify papers that had high Google page rank, but were not that highly cited. And the thing about Google page rank is that roughly speaking, if you're important and you cite me, that really helps me a lot. Whereas if you're unimportant and you cite me, it doesn't mean anything to me because you're just unimportant. And so what Google page rank does is it looks at the importance of who's citing you. So if someone important sites me that boosts my Google page rank. And so it turns out that we found papers that were not very highly cited, but the people who cited them were really famous people. So it was obviously this was an important paper and we could identify really important papers by this kind of mechanism. It seems to me like, and maybe this Michael Garfield (47m 30s): Is just because my head is broken in this way, that it's like, everything reminds me of Jennifer Dunn's work on food webs and feeding networks. And I wonder if this disparity between the citations and the page rank is useful in terms of kind of predicting the way that a given organism is going to move in a trophic network as that network is disrupted. For instance, if you look at, say 120 million years ago, there's no evidence that the animal that eventually became Tyrannosaurus Rex was going to ever take over that niche as a Keystone predator. And yet it did. And maybe this question of like, it's not, the analogy would be something like it was feeding on the right animals. Like it wasn't necessarily that it was, you could be a generalists say and still everything that you're eating gets wiped out in some extinction, but if you're eating the right thing, then you're leftover afterwards. I mean, is this making any sense? Sidney Redner (48m 30s): There's still a lot that can be, I think, gleaned from citation statistics because there's fields that become hot and fields to become fallow and fields that stay fallow for a long period of time and they become hot again. And so there's a lot of this sort of bursting this to like the citation statistics that I think might have some analogy with evolution itself, you know, we think about punctuated evolution or something like that. So I think that's a really interesting thought. I don't think has been that well developed. You know, I think people have been thinking along those lines about just how different fields have become hot, how different fields get used up in some sense, or how some fields followed a favor and then some experimental discovery happens or some technology happens that allows a field to rise again after a long period of time. You mentioned the notion of sleeping beauties that seems to underlie a lot of the sleeping beauty phenomena that we see in scientific citations. Michael Garfield (49m 22s): It seems like this kind of analysis would be useful in helping to understand when a particular market bubble isn't really just a bubble. That's like something about the interoperability that you would think about, like in terms of a citation network that would help us differentiate between when something is just seasonally hot when it's in fashion versus when it has real traction. Sidney Redner (49m 45s): Well, I mean, that's a really interesting thought and I don't know how to differentiate between like fashionable bubbles versus something that's really got traction. I can maybe retrospectively you could see it. I don't know if you want to do anything predictively. Michael Garfield (49m 59s): So the last place I'd like to park this conversation as it were is in a paper that you wrote with Paul Krapivsky on simple parking strategies. This was a lot of fun for me. I got to do an animation of this paper for the SFI YouTube channel and to loop this back around to where you really shine as a researcher in creating these concrete real-world relatable scenarios, where you can apply the math and give people some insight into how to navigate their lives. You know, take us out on parking. Sidney Redner (50m 33s): If you asked me like, where did this project get born? I honestly don't know. Paul Krapivsky is my closest collaborator. And we've written 85 papers together, maybe 86, I forget. And we talk about anything and everything. And like our conversations will go from science to politics, to religion, to science back again. And I've always been thinking about crowding phenomenon. And, and in fact, we wrote a textbook, a graduate textbook on statistical physics, where we talk about absorption, desorption problems. And in there is something that we can think of as a model for parking, where cars come and take up spots and then a car might leave. And the point is that if there's no well-defined parking spots, it could be that you have like a space that could fit three cars, but two schmucks parked like in a bad way so that you can only fit two cars in there. But when those two cars leave, three cars can go into that spot. And so there's like an irreversible increase in the density of parked cars, but that model is very complicated. And so somehow we were just talking about what's the simplest thing we could possibly do. And so that led us to this parking model of a one-dimensional parking lot, where you're trying to get to a store and you want to get close to the store, but if you go too close, then maybe you don't have a parking spot. And then you've got to go back all the way around to the back of the parking lot. And so that's how that model got itself born. And in fact, the model that in the end turns out to be the most interesting was something which you did not mention, which is our second paper on the subject, which was what was the optimum parking strategy. And so imagine that you have like a one-dimensional lock. So again, we physicists, we try and make the spherical cap model of everything. So we want to simplify things to the point that we can mathematize it. So we imagine there's a one-dimensional lot. There's a store at the end of the one-dimensional lot and cars arrive and they arrive at a certain rate. They leave at a much slower rate because the point is that you might spend say an hour in a shopping mall. So that sort of defines the relative rate of coming in to leaving. And so then the question is, what should you do? And if you have a one-dimensional lot, then you can see an open spot, but you can't see beyond parked cars to see if there's other open spots closer to the store. And so what is the optimal thing to do? And it turns out that for this very simple toy model, the optimum thing, and also you have to define what do you mean by optimum? So we would define optimum is that you've parked in the very best available spot. And so the way you park in the very best available spot is that you enter the parking lot. It has a certain length L. You go to L over two, you ignore all open spots, a distance L over two or further away. And at L over two, you start looking for spots, you'd take the first one available. And that turns out to maximize the probability that you will actually park in the best available spot. That's there at the time that you're in the lot. Michael Garfield (53m 20s): Just to open this back up from toy model spherical cap-ness, to real-world complexity. I think you and I both know that we've got a lot of kickback when we shared this. Some people want to park their car in the shade. You know, some people actually want to optimize for walking time because they feel like they need more exercise. And I just thought it was so funny that people felt the need to tilt their spirits at this, given that I watched you ride your bike up that insane hill to work every day before the pandemic. And as it's you don't know who you're dealing with here. I think it's just worth mentioning as a tie into the conversation I had with Chris more about how careful we have to be in the design of our algorithms to think about what real world complexity we're actually leaving out. And maybe just inviting you to talk about that a little bit would be a great way to wrap this up.Sidney Redner (54m 9s): There's a very famous saying, which has been attributed to Einstein, but apparently it was not his saying, which is that a model should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. And so I think the point is that I try and live in that space of the model should be as simple as possible, but no simpler so that we capture some of the collective behavior that one might see in a complex system. Like where should you park your car? What is the length of winning streaks of the baseball team, but all these other things, well maybe some people like to park in the shade. Maybe some people want to get a bit more exercise. These are like complications that in principle, I know the tools of how you might deal with it, but it then loses the simplicity and the beauty of like a clean solution. Engineers have to worry about real world problems. You know, they have a real parking lot with a real traffic pattern in it. And then you have to worry about all of these microscopic details. But I think that those microscopic details are a way that you then lose the forest through the trees. And so I'm trying to look at the forest, the big picture rather than each individual tree. Michael Garfield (55m 10s): So looking at the forest, what's next for you? What have you not yet explored in your work that's maybe a burning question for you now, or an area that's calling to you in the time to come? Sidney Redner (55m 24s): I am working on a project, which is in its very formative stages right now. And it might be crap. It might lead to nothing, but I'm very enthused about it because it seems to bring up a new element about first passage processes and it's to try and understand the rule of income redistribution of any kind on overall wealth of the society. And so, again, in the spirit of the spherical cal, we're just thinking about the following thing. You have two starving graduate students and their wealth just evolves by random walk. Sometimes they gain a dollar. Sometimes they lose a dollar, but when you go broke, there's two outcomes you could imagine. One is that one grad student goes broke and then the other graduate student goes broke, and that might be the egoistic society. And then you can say, well, how long does it take before both people are broken? What is the average wealth of this two-person population as a function of time? But now you can say, well, suppose that when one guy goes broke, the other guy has an altruist and the person who's broke says, please lend me some money. And the other guy says, or girl says, well, here, you can have half of my money because you know, I'm an altruist. And then you continue until somebody goes broke again. And then you just share your money equally. Is altruism good or is altruism bad? And so that's the basic question that we're trying to investigate right now. And it's turns out to be very simple, to formulate. I've just formulated the model and incredibly challenging to actually solve analytically. And we have some partial answers and maybe in six months we'll have more answers, but it seems like a really fun problem. And it raises some very fundamental issues in first passage process and fundamental technical issues and some fundamental conceptual issues that we're grappling with right now. Well, I await your results with a baited breath aware a stimulus check. Thank you so much Sid for taking the time to talk and for sharing your mind and your work with everybody today. I'm glad to do it. Thank you. Thank you for listening.

59,Episode Details / Transcript Andrea Wulf (0s): There's no point in just knowing if you are a scientist. Surely the communication, I don't know if you'd even call it an audience, but to your fellow human beings, is very important. And I think Humboldt was excellent at that. So the Naturegemälde, which is essentially a drawing of a cross-section of Chimborazo, which has all the plant names of the plants he found at the exact altitude where he had found them. And then to the left and to the right, you have 20 columns filled with scientific data of all the stuff he measured basically as he was going up from humidity, temperature, the blueness of the sky, the chemical components of the air.So what you can do is you can trace a line across, say at 10,000 feet, and you get all the information that is now they surely think about this is that it's basically a poster. It's packed with complex scientific data, but it's super easy to understand. Everybody can understand it. You don't need to be a scientist. That's why his books are huge international bestsellers. Michael Garfield (1m 3s): When you hear the word nature, what comes to mind? Chances are, if you are listening to this in the 21st century, the images, one of a vast interconnected living network, one in which you and your fellow human beings play a complicated part. And yet this is a relatively recent way of thinking for the modern west. It takes a special kind of thinker and a special kind of life to find and recognize the patterns that connect different environments around the world. Until the pioneering research of 19th century explorer, Alexander Von Humboldt, no one had ever noticed global similarities between the climates and creatures on a given altitude on different continents is legendary work popularized, not only a new portrait of the world and its complex inter-relatedness, but innovated vastly influential ways of doing and communicating science, including novel data visualization and international interdisciplinary collaboration methods.Von Humboldt, though, would bristle at the notion that he stands alone as some great man in history preferring to acknowledge not just the inspiration that he drew from poets and philosophers, but also the indigenous peoples he met and worked with in his travels. His theories begged to be examined in light of the aesthetic sensibilities with which they were communicated as well as their socio-political and philosophical impact, including how they fertilized the transcendentalist romantics, founded what we now call ecology and exemplified a synthesis of art and science at which our age of fragmented knowledge can only marvel.Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week and next, we have a special two-part conversation for you with SFI Miller scholar, Andrea Wulf, author of six, including the New York times best seller, The Invention of Nature, winner of the Royal Society Science Book Prize, and too many others to name in this introduction.In Wulf's words, this is not a biography about this great man. This is the biography of an idea. In part one, we begin our journey in Prussia at the turn of the 19th century in a rich milieu of daring minds and how their philosophies formed the basis for a profound new vision of the natural world.Michael Garfield (3m 29s): Subscribe to complexity podcast, wherever you prefer to listen for part two next week.

This last year of working remote has taken a toll, I think, on a lot of people and it's hard to maintain the rapport with everybody when you never see each other.Andrea Wulf (4m 0s): I totally agree. I find as a writer, I'm obviously kind of used to having these long periods of being a hermit. So I think it's a good profession in a pandemic. But I’m totally missing all the kind of serendipity of being in a bar and talking to someone about something completely unrelated, which then suddenly inspires you to think about something which then somehow kind of makes it into your book and all this. I'm a kisser and a hugger. So I'm finding this very difficult, not to touch people.Michael Garfield (4m 32s): I have a two year old now and it's like, what is happening to her young brain through all of seeing people in masks. Andrea Wulf (4m 41s): My daughter had a baby while I got stuck in Germany with hand luggage for several months and missed the birth of my grandchildren. That's the bit I struggled the most about. He's now nine months and you see now he's not really played with any kids. He's not like licked other babies and all that stuff you do, crawl over. It's very strange. And I totally agree. I had not even thought about the face mask really hard just with your eyes.Michael Garfield (5m 12s): At least then you still have your eyes. Text only communication is a disaster. All of the other problems that people are claiming about social media, I think pale in comparison to the idea that we can scale human communication. No matter how brilliantly we designed the newsfeed algorithms, trying to understand each other, when you have nothing else to go on is just a nightmare. All of these large companies that are going fully remote, like it seems all progressive.Andrea Wulf (5m 40s): It's probably really nice if you work like a couple of days at but I missed my fellowship in Santa Fe because of the stupid pundit I was meant to arrive on the 2nd of April. I was really looking forward to it because it is such a bonkers place for someone who does something, what I do. It's terrifying also because I can remember sitting there and I think it was Cris Moore and he had this German guy Stefan over and they were like scribbling or doing this mathematical proven. For me, it was like the first time actually seeing what I write about historically happening in real life, but also being absolutely terrified because I'm not a scientist, but I just loved it.I just so enjoyed it. And I was meant to come for three months and I was so looking forward to it. I have a Zoom meeting scheduled with Tim and David next week. I'm going to beg them to do something because I can't come now because I have to finish the boo. I think it's not the right time anyway. So I want to beg them I'm be able to push it to '23 for my next book. You have to wish me luck. Michael Garfield: What is this next book on? What is it?Andrea Wulf: It was finished because I have not been distracted for more than a year now. I'm working like day and night on this.So boring in the middle of nowhere in Germany. So cold, still in mid-May. I'm still in my winter clothes. I haven't worked out my elevator pitch yet. So I can't really summarize it briefly, but it's basically about a bunch of philosophers and poets and writers who came together for a decade in this small town in Germany, Jena, which is where Humboldt also went in 1794. And for like a blink of a moment in Western philosophy, they changed everything.So you have every single important German philosopher and poet live in this tiny 4,000 people town coming up with a new philosophy. That's what I'm arguing that makes us a selfish species, which ultimately will destroy the planet. But also it's basically the moment where we began to use ourself as the lens through which to understand the world, which was exhilarating then, because it gave us free will and power, self-determination all these exciting things. But we became these people who think it's our right to take ourselves as the very first lens through which to understand the world.And it's this balancing act between who am I as an individual, who am I as a member of a community, which of course through the pandemic became something really important again. So Humboldt is a sight figure in there because he comes in for a brief moment. But Goethe, for example, very important. But there's a bunch of philosophers which no one has heard of in the English speaking well, but which are super famous people in Germany. I think I'm trying to bring them down from their pedestal as the kind of great writers and thinkers.The fun thing is they will have affairs with each other. So there's a lot of sex and rock and roll basically, which is really, really hard to get through. And then I just have to get my reader back now they're all having sex with women who are getting divorced three times. And so it's been a fun book to write.Michael Garfield (9m 3s): It's funny that you bring this particular thing up. It's obvious it's such an obvious natural extension from the Humboldt work. It's just worth noting as like a segway into an actual podcast. It's funny how these things happen, where you have this nucleus of innovation, somewhere, that out of that kind of collaborative intermingling could emerge an idea about a liberal, modern self that's like a viral meme that like you just said, spun completely out of control.And it's taken over the world and is undermining its own ecological supports to fold it into Humboldt's vision of the world and like to give us a place to start here. That reminds me of the way that all of the complex neural motifs in the brain come together to form the appearance of an individual. There's something in the zeitgeists or in the philosophical development that resembles this tension that we see between understanding the underlying reality, understanding the nature of humans and the rest of the living world in terms of individuals or in terms of networks.Andrea Wulf (10m 19s): If you've read Merlin Sheldrake's book, The Entangled Life about fungi. I mean, he poses these fascinating questions about what is actually an organism we've gone to for so long have assumed she's something where we end basically. That's our organism, but no, not really. There are all these things in us. What I find interesting about this is actually because I'm a historian. I always like to understand where something is coming from. It's almost kind of settling the horse backwards if you know what I mean. So basically I became interested in this by looking at why are we so selfish?There was a moment completely banal. I was on one of my Humboldt trips and I was in Peru and I went to Machu Picchu and it was like a long schlep up there. The first thing that people do that tourists do is take a selfie of themselves in front of it. It's really beautiful. Why would you put yourself in there? And it's that sense of why do we always have to see everything through the lens of our individual life in a way? And you said, this seems like a natural extension to the Humboldt book and weirdly for a long time.I didn't think so. I feel like, how am I ever going to explain to my readers, how I came from this explorer, who is the forgotten father and family environmentalist to these kind of bunch of German philosophers other than that, he knew them. And that I knew about this scenery really by him being there for a moment. It didn't feel a natural topic first for me, because I always write about the relationship between human kind of nature. And then I realized, no, it's actually not. If I want to truly understand the relationship between human kind of nature I actually have to understand us as an individual first that's actually the book we should have been written before the Humboldt book in a funny sort of way. But I seem to do books backwards because philosophers there, he basically really came up with this idea that we live in this unity, like mind and matter, which had always been before separated became one in his philosophy, in the school, the nature philosophy, which then becomes incredibly important for home, but who takes this and applies this to science.And it says, well, this is all in living organism. It's funny how these things somehow always come together in the end. So I don't know what has to come after that book then, because I think now I've arrived. I've arrived. Where is the individual coming from? So I have no idea. It has to be about God then or something like that.Michael Garfield (12m 46s): I would say probably, I was going to say medieval cosmologist, isn't the gritty prequel to the gritty prequels, right? You actually jumped right into where I wanted to start this with you, which was with Schelling and with Goethe with these relationships that this guy who we should have actually introduced. Alexander Von Humboldt has these relationships with these brilliant poetic thinkers that shape the way that he ultimately decides to explore the world and the way that he decides to communicate it.And to me, this was the piece that just to like run a thread through this whole conversation about the relationship between science and art and poetry and philosophy and the imagination, how we really ought to perhaps. I have to be careful about shoulds in these conversations, but like given the remarkable track record of this guy's visionary accomplishments, all the things we're going to talk about today, like basically invented big science, basically invented data visualization, basically invented international interdisciplinary collaborations, invented the way that we think about nature today, essentially.And he had all sorts of really, really prescient political observations as well. Maybe we should be heating his words about the relationship between these other disciplines that so often don't seem to figure into what we think of as the process of discovery these days. That's all just to say, where do you start us in the development of this, guy's mind this guy's approach to the world and his story? Andrea Wulf (14m 29s): So this is really unfair because you just basically started on my favorite subject and I have to now paddle back and introduce him. So you'll have to remind me that we go back to there because I actually think that Humboldt’s insight about this very tight bond between the arts and the sciences is I think at the moment, for me, the most important aspect of his very broad life. So let's paddle back a little bit and start actually who he was. So some basic facts, he was born in 1769, which is the same year as Napoleon. He was the son of a wealthy Prussian aristocratic family in Berlin, where he was brought up.He had a quite unhappy childhood, a very kind of emotionally cold mother. He was educated to the kind of highest standards at that time. So very much within the kind of enlightenment thinking. The mother dies when he's quite young, instead of going to the funeral and being really sad he was rather pleased about the whole thing and said, “oh, I finally, I can go on this great big voyage, which I'm planning to do.” So he left his life of privilege. He went on an exploration of South America and he left Europe in 1799 just before his birthday.And he spent five years in south America. And I think that's really important as a private person. He was very wealthy. So he paid for everything himself, but all other explorations before were really done and organized by governments and monarchs. So you had a particular remit. There was something you had to find out that would be good for you or government or your country or your Monarch. Now Humboldt didn't have any of those restraints. He traveled with a very small team.So he's very nimble when he heard something on the ground, someone local told him, you should go over there. He could just change his itinerary. So he's very flexible. And I think that's something we have to kind of bear in mind. He travels through South America and during this exploration, he realizes and begins to really, truly understand nature as a global force. And that's something we can talk about later. So he's really the first who looks at nature on a global scale, on a very interdisciplinary scale at a time when other scientists are very much obsessed with taxonomy. That's also something we should not forget because for us, this seems like a really normal thing to do now, but then it was not at all.So he goes on this big exploration, which would always argue, really shaped his life and his thinking and makes him kind of famous across the world. He quickly stops by in DC to meet the President of the United States then goes back to Europe lifts for about 20 years in Paris, because this is really the center of scientific inquiry at that time, then is broke because he spent all his money on his exploration and really has to go back to Berlin, to work for the king there, and then stays there until he dies in 1859 or just a few months short before his 90th birthday, the same year when Darwin publishes the original species. So just to cap his life, when he dies, he is the most famous scientist of his age. 10 years later, the Centennial of his birth is celebrated across the world. Just to you a sense of how famous this man is who many people have never heard about today, when his Centennial was celebrated in New York, there were 25,000 people marching through the streets of Manhattan to unveil a bust in Central Park, which is still there at the Explorer's gate opposite the Natural History Museum, the entire front page of the New York times was dedicated to homeboy. So he was an absolute superstar, rightly so I think. And now we can talk about why he was a superstar.Michael Garfield (18m 22s): Let's reel all that back to his relationship with Goethe. Goethe was one of these people that had so many foundational and now seemingly very strange ideas about the practice of science. At the time we're not even talking about scientists proper. We're talking about natural philosophers. Andrea Wulf (18m 45s): This really depends on your definition. I actually think more and more these days, that science, as they did then, the science, which also allowed your imagination to play an important role. And maybe even your emotional responses, which is obviously something that's not really accepted today, but I would argue that that was for that science quite important for the revelations maybe they all also have. But basically Humboldt is very important for Goethe but maybe good is even more important for Humboldt.So they meet in 1794 when Humboldt is in his twenties and Goethe in his forties. Goethe is the most famous German poet. He is an international superstar. He's really the God of German literature at that time. And he lives in this tiny little place in Germany Weimer and there's another city next to it which is actually where my new book is set. So Jena is this tiny university town, 4,000 people, but it's a very strange place because it is through kind of inheritance laws.What was once a dukedom was split so small that there were effectively four rulers ruling this tiny little university with effectively no one in charge. So what happened? Every professor who had problems somewhere in one of the German territories moved to Jena because you basically do their, whatever you wanted. So it becomes this liberal, tiny little spot with these incredible visionary thinkers who all together in this kind of tiny little town.So Goethe hangs out with them, Goethe loves these young people who come with these amazing ideas. He kind of feels quite old and uncreative. The war’s raging through Europe, but he's also a scientist. He's obsessed with botany. For example, establishes a botanical garden there. He has a rock collection of 18,000 rocks. He's obsessed with color, theory, optics. So he's really into signs. But he feels a bit stale, let's say. And then Humboldt rocks up who’s in his mid-twenties who is very restless, curious person. Humboldt himself describes that he felt as if he was chased by 10,000 pigs.So there's this kind of drive in him. He never stops. He jumps so quickly from one subject to another that very few people can actually follow him. He's interested in everything, but he's still very much a child of the enlightenment who believes in empirical research. It's all about data. It's all about collecting data. It's all about measuring. That's really what his approach to science is. And then he meets Goethe, and these other young people who live there in Jena and he changes this time in year now completely changes him because these are people who begin to see that subjectivity your senses, your mind, the categories that your mind imposes on the world, all of this is important in order to understand the world.So the question they're all asking themselves is how do we understand nature? How do we understand the natural world? Is this through rational knowledge that somehow in our brain when we are born or is that something that comes through experience? So they all have kind of different opinions. And in the end, the philosophy that comes out of Jena is a philosophy that believes that the self basically creates at least what we know about the world and they call it the self and the non-self.So the non-self is everything that's not the self. Now, if you accept that, suddenly your impressions also become important. It's not just what you measure with your scientific instruments. So Goethe is really the person and some of the philosophers there who push Humboldt in another direction. And then there's Schelling, who will meet him there but later who comes up with this nature philosophy, which is taking this philosophy of the self a step further saying, “well, yes, there is the self and the non-self, but that is actually one big unity.”If this is one big unity, it also means that, and that is what becomes really important for the romantics. If we are the same as nature, then we can also discover ourselves in nature. So this is really the moment when they will start going out, climbing up mountains and finding themselves. So for Humboldt, this idea becomes the nucleus of his thinking that is one big living organism. And we are just a tiny part in this, which then becomes incredibly important for environmental ideas.And he himself says that in Jena and Goethe that Goethe has given him new organs through which to understand the world. And it's with these new organs that he travels through South America. And these organs also include your feelings, your emotions, and your imagination. At the same time, he carries 42 scientific instruments through Latin America. So it was not admiring the moon going like, “ah, there's nothing so beautiful to my soul in my heart.”He measures he's a proper, proper scientist. He's obsessed with hard data, but at the same time, he will say my favorite quote is when he says “what escapes the measurements speaks to the soul.” So both is important.Michael Garfield (24m 23s): There's a line that you quote a Frederick Schelling's “I, myself am identical with nature.” It seems perhaps like a paradox, but I think it's worth exploring. You mentioned the mountain climbing, everyone starts climbing mountains and there is a particularly modern scientific iteration of a very classic human right, which is the spiritual pilgrimage to the mountaintop. And the way that he weaves, like you said, more spiritual or poetic concerns into his process, brings us to the Zenith, both literally and narratively of his life, which happens at the peak of Chimborazo.This is in Ecuador, right? This mountain, which if I'm remembering this correctly, this was like the tallest summit. Andrea Wulf (25m 12s): So it's almost 21,000 feet and it was then believed to be the highest mountain. And in a way it is because it sits almost on the equator. So it's distance to the planet actually makes it better.Michael Garfield (25m 25s): Your book is full of these extraordinary accounts of Humboldt and his small team of friends and help climbing this peak against all odds, deprived of oxygen, frozen, getting their horses shocked by electric eels. And I mean, not dead like down there, I was like in the Orinoco. His trip is just extraordinary. And he gets to the top, sees something that we take for granted now, when people talk about getting out into space, we talk about the overview effect that astronauts have.There's only one, I forget who it was, there's like one astronaut that's on public record is saying I was kind of underwhelmed. Like everybody was talking it up. I was just like, “oh yeah, it's the planet.” But everyone else has this literal and metaphorical peak experience. And there's something about what you said about the Jena group and their differentiation between self and non-self that seems to prepare the flow of philosophical thinking into, like a dialectic, it seems like it's first, it's like a thesis antithesis.And then you bring them together and you say, “I myself am identical with nature.” That's the synthesis. And that that's the move that we see Humboldt take with his essay on the geography of plants and his articulation, that all of these to stand on top of what you believe to be the world's tallest mountain, to look down at the way that the plant ecosystems change as you move up in altitude. And to recognize that it's something's extremely similar in that there's this unity in this convergence going on. You have to get out far enough to see in from a fresh perspective and realize he is presaging somebody like Ed Mitchell or Rusty Schweikert saying this planet.Andrea Wulf (27m 25s): It's interesting that you actually use the astronauts because very often I showed the Earthrise photo in my lectures because I think it's exactly the same feeling. So no one had ever been so high up as he had. So he has this ability to zoom into the microscopic, but also to kind of zoom out. And I think they're not a lot of people who can actually do that, who have the mind, the very particular mind to go into the tiniest, tiniest detail, but then also have that sense of broad understanding when they zoom out for kind of broad, big ideas and concepts.And he was definitely someone who could do that. And maybe also very luckily for him, he chose Chimborazo at that particular moment, because it is a mountain that stands on the equator. You have this very extraordinary thing happening that you start off in the valley and it's tropical. You have [inaudible] and fuchsias and you have all these tropical bananas, palm trees, all these tropical plants. And as you move up and that's what he described, it is like a botanical journey from the equator to the pole.So you do, you have a geographical journey and he literally has an epiphany on the top of Chimborazo maybe slightly induced by altitude sickness. I don't know, but it is a moment when he realizes that everything hangs together because as he goes up to Mirazo, so he sees because he has this extraordinary mind and memory, he sees these plants. He had seen elsewhere in the Alps, in Switzerland, in the Pyrenees on Tenerife. And he makes a connection to like, hold on a second.I've seen the plant like this somewhere else. He then spends many, many, many years trying to kind of bring all these different plants together and comparing them and understanding that we actually have also global vegetation zones. So again, it's that he uses taxonomy in part because that's how you classify plants, but that's not what he's interested in at all. He needs it as his data, but he's interested in putting these things together.And for me, one of the great examples is when he looks at climate. Scientists really until then were just taking the temperature. So Thomas Jefferson, for example, is utterly obsessed with metrology. So he takes every single day. He takes the temperature wherever he is and when he's not in Monticello, he asks someone else to do it. So you end up with these notebooks with long, long, long lists of temperature and Humboldt does something very, very different. Humboldt visualizes this. So he compares temperatures at different places in this world.But instead of having a column for Stockholm column, for Paris, a column for London and for Mexico, he puts this on a map. And what he sees is he invents isotherms, these kind of wavy lines of temperature and humidity and stuff like that. So he understands that global climate zones, which you can only do because you visualize something. And I think in a way, the Jena, the time in Jena has prepared him for that because all of them there talked about imagination as the most important thing.And the end, they also taught, which I think is really important, which something you touched on earliest, they talked about we have to ATA-size the sciences and that I think is something really important and it works on many levels. So one is the level of Humboldt comes back and describes his journeys like a poet, really. But at the same time, he uses also a scientific data. So and you end up with these books that are really for the general audience, but which combine scientific observation with very evocative, poetic landscape descriptions.But I think poeticizing the science means also something different. It's not just to write poetically about the sciences. It also means that you allow imagination and genius, artistic genius into the sciences that you roll with it a little bit. You don't just divide it. And you have someone like Humphry Davy, the chemist, who, when you look at his actual manuscripts in his notebooks, you'll see on one side of the notebook, he'll write down the scientific results of his experiments.And on the other side, he writes his emotional responses to what he's seen. And I think that it's quite important and Humboldt is really very much ahead of his time. Michael Garfield (32m 2s): There's another way in which belief in a union or a relationship, depending on kind of how you cook it between science and poetry shows up. I'm really interested in like you said, that the isotherms and the data visualization piece of this and the role of the image and translating an image because I had a conversation about a scientific illustration in college, trying to understand why it is that people still do this rather than just taking photographs.We have these incredibly sophisticated cameras. Why do you still hire an illustrator? And it was, you need someone to cut out all of the unnecessary detail. You need somebody who knows what's relevant and what's irrelevant. And that requires understanding the audience and the nonlinear path that a fact must take in order to be received, taken up into the network of someone else's brain. Danielle Bassett gave an excellent SFI community lecture about this network, thinking themselves, which we'll link in the show notes about the structure of narrative and how narrative is such a persistent, strongly converge form in human communication, because of the way that we process and take up information.And you know what? We had Kirell Benzi on the show, Swiss data artist. The talk that he gave at SFI, which we'll link also, was all about this question of how do you get a signal through to someone? It's not just, you know, how do I display this for my own understanding? It's how do I display it for others? I think we got a little bit ahead because the isotherms actually come much after the Naturegemalde, that profile that you have on the spine of the book of Chimborazo and its various climates.Andrea Wulf (33m 55s): As a writer, of course my task is to tell a story. I mean the word history has the word story in it. There's no point in just me telling the story to myself. So I obviously need my readers, my audience. I want to take them with me for me. That's the fun bit really. So I'm obsessed, for example, with structure. I restructure my books. I spent more time structuring than actually writing. It’s ridiculous and I just pull everything apart.It's like a game of domino's it all falls apart. I've just taken three chapters apart and it's like, “oh God, what a mess.” But I think it's incredibly important if the structure works well, you don't notice it at all because it just flows. And in a way in science, I think it's even more important because science is difficult for non-scientific people like me. So science communication is so essential, especially, dare I say, in a pandemic or even more when it comes to climate change because there's no point in doing all the science when you don't get everybody on this planet to go along with you.And that only will work if you touch them somehow. And I would argue that it's not always the scary numbers. Sometimes it's about visualizing something. So there's for example, there's this amazing Belfast artist, he's called Robin Prize. What he does is through experimental photography he can visualize the fine particulate matter that's so harmful and they look like little twinkly fairy lights. So he takes a photograph say for example, of the coast of Mexico, because of Wales where there's hardly any air pollution and you just see like a few little twinkles and then Mexico city, and then like new Delhi, it's just a carpet or fairy lights.So for me, as it in a non-number person that was so much more, a kind of brutal realization of air pollution than if you'd given me the equivalent numbers to those three places. And so I think we need power. We need artists. We need musicians to all deal with this. So it is about visualization. It's about communicating. There's no point in just knowing what's happening if you are a scientist. Surely the communication I don't know if you even call it an audience, but to, you know, your fellow human beings is very important at least in certain fields.And I think Humboldt was excellent at that. So the Naturegemälde, which is essentially a drawing of a cross-section of Chimborazo, which has drawn in all the plant names of the plants he found at the exact altitude where he had found them. And then to the left and to the right, you have 20 columns, which are filled with scientific data of all the stuff you measured, basically, as he was going up from humidity, temperature, the blueness of the sky, the chemical components of the air, all these kind of things, or drawn into the columns at the altitude where he had measured it.So what you can do is you can trace a line across say at 10,000 feet and you get all the information that is now they surely think about this is that it's basically a poster. It's packed with complex scientific data, but it's super easy to understand. Everybody can understand it. You don't need to be a scientist. He is targeting very much not the scientist in the ivory tower. He's targeting everybody. That's why his books are huge international bestsellers.Michael Garfield (37m 32s): EO Wilson says the ideal scientist thinks like a poet works like a bookkeeper and all too rarely writes like a journalist. I want to, at this point, draw a distinction between the way that he so effectively communicated in his writing and in his imagery and the way that he actually took notes and wrote because you have this wonderful passage on page 230 of the paperback version where you show his lecture notes and how it's like pieces. He wrote the thing and then he scrawled in the margins and then he started putting notes on them.And then he stuck notes onto the notes. And it looks like when I had Mark Moffett on the show to talk about canopy biology and about like the way you go down to the Amazon and you see trees growing on trees, growing on trees. The soil on the branches is thicker than the soil on the ground. And that's what it looks like. That's what, in a way, again, speaking back to this sort of proto-cybernetic, understanding of sense impressions and the inner workings of mind as related intimately to the outer world. It's like he actually explicated the tangled inner workings of the mind that are themselves an evolutionary hypothesis about our tangled environment.You know what Charles Darwin called the tangled bank. In order to communicate that you do not, as I have on many mistaken occasions done myself, you do not just throw that out in front of people and expect them to make sense of it. You map the twisting rivers and the winding forests, and then you cut a trail through them. You're able to use that landscape in order to identify a path of lowest entropy or whatever through this wilderness of ideas. And it's just a really beautiful thing there.Andrea Wulf (39m 22s): I'm obsessed with manuscripts because I think we can learn so much by it. So I don't understand historians who don't go into an archive because I think it reveals so much that it's otherwise hidden. If you think about how you write, for example, how you take notes, it shows something. And some people are really super tidy and others, you see their highlighters and order it and others, you know, total mess. So Humboldt’s multilayered, collages of thoughts. I think the only way I can describe it for me, shows that his mind, he doesn't think linear.You know, he thinks like he understands nature. It's a weapon, everything branches out, everything is connected. And this is one of the reasons why I wanted to do or why I did the Adventures of Alexander Von Humboldt, the graphic novel, which is really not a graphic novel, but it was just like some weird illustrated hybrid, which I've kind of refusing to categorize in a way. Humboldt came back with 4,000 pages from his diary and with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of drawings and sketches. So he was very much someone who understood nature by visualizing it by drawing it.So you talking about how, why do we need scientific illustrator? Because they extract something also, which is important. I think a lot of scientists also draw because that's a way for them to make sense of something that you sometimes can't make sense of with words, but you can do visually. And when you look at his papers, at his manuscripts, you realize just how important this all is for him. So I wanted to do a book that showed this, that showed all the stuff I couldn't show in the invention of nature, which is, you know, more kind of traditional book and you see how he takes deeper through drawing, but you also see how he writes.I mean, he has terrible handwriting, but how he writes something like in the corner and then in another corner, and then he sticks something on top. And then you have this extraordinary system of filing, which might sound boring, but bear with me. So his filing system, I think it's basically a computer. It's so clever. So here is, and then amazingly kept it like this. So in the archives in Berlin, you get out these boxes. He called them boxes box eight box, whatever box nine, box nine B.And in that box, you have open envelopes which have also titles, so say a box is called Slavery. Then you have in that box, an envelope that is called Sugar because of course sugar has to do with slavery. Now in that envelope, but sugar, he will have something about the botany of the plants. He will have something about work conditions, all these kinds of different things. So he would get a letter from someone who worked at a slave plantation in the West Indies with botanical information.So that goes into the envelope, sugar, botany or something like that. And then he would have someone write him something about the health effect it had on slaves or something. And then he has this kind of box slavery, and then he starts writing his books. And so he can just take out this box and he can use it, but he can file it like a page from a book. He has never problems with tearing our pages from books, put that in a newspaper articular letter, but then he does writing another essay or another book.And suddenly it is about the botany of I'm making this up now, the botany of the west Indies. So you can just take the envelope out of the slavery box and he can put it into the box botany of the West Indies. So he has this vast archive of information, but he can resort it and refile it, according to the project he's working on which is keywording basically in an analog way, which I think is so clever, which allows him to make these connections, which I think other people can't do because they have a different filing system.Michael Garfield (43m 26s): I wanted to get into some of the ways that he helped pioneer the practices of what we think of as more contemporary, even like 21st century science. And one of them is this, the keyword operations that notion that Humboldt unites a whole academy within him, that he couldn't pick a given discipline. Like you said, he's at home in powers of 10, like swinging through the micro to the macro and, and back. And this is like, of course back when computers were still people. That was a job description.So it's just interesting. There's like the two scales that he's operating at a time when extraordinary individuals were capable of this quote unquote Renaissance kind of thinking yet, it sounds reading your book like he knew, he says without a diversity of opinion, that discovery of truth is impossible. Even to be fully self-contained an academy within you, you still need to reach out and forge what sounded like kind of one of the first interdisciplinary working groups, which was the magnetic crusade.He was holding salons where he was bringing people together and these kinds of pre- sentiments of large international collaborations and so on. It's interesting again, because it's this it again, echoes the organization that you're talking about here, in terms of the way his own mind sort of echoes the structures of the environments that he was exploring and how that's each of us contains multitudes, but also participates in society.And then that kind of thinking lends itself to some more like speculative stuff I want to put a pin in for later because I think it's when you get to the natural religion of Ernst Haeckel and questions about the sort of transcendent component here, I think it's really fascinating.Andrea Wulf (45m 20s): I think Humboldt lives at a very particular moment and dies at a very particular moment. So he dies in 1859. So I think he's pretty much the last great polymath because after that, it's absolutely impossible for one person to hold all this knowledge in one head and towards the end of his life, he's really, really struggling already to just keep it all together. Even with his great filing system. There's a reason that Humboldt wrote 50,000 letters and he received a hundred thousand letters.So he surely believes in sharing knowledge. This is about finding out what's going on. This is not about I'm finding it out. This is about, let's find it out, us, together. I want to know. This is what drives in this deep, deep curiosity. So he always opens up his notebook. So there are great moments when Charles Lyell, for example, comes in 1823 to Paris, this kind of young geologists, not really not known at all.And Humboldt gives him all the information he has about volcanoes and South America, which is very important for Lyell, later on. So he shares, but he's also expecting others to share with him. So he gets very, very excited when they're talking about telegrams and they kind of the telegraph, the cable, because he can just imagine, you can just call someone in America to find something out because obviously he has to write a letter and he has to find out, but he has this army of helpers, which are fellow scientists. So he never allowed to travel to India.The British basically don't want this Prussian troublemaker commenting on colonialism as he had done in South America. So he is not allowed to go to India, but he needs to compare the Himalaya with the Andes. He assists the British botanist Hooker to go to the Himalaya. And then the poor man is bombarded with letters by Humboldt who literally will write and say, would you mind going up this mountain slope on the Southern side? And we're going to tell you which plant is growing on, which, which altitude, because he needs that information.Or he will do stuff where he, because he can also be quite obnoxious. He publishes his book so that later on, when he published his cosmos and that huge sections of astronomical observations in there, and he will get approved from his printer without the figures. And he will send that to an astronomer. And he like, can you just fill in the numbers? It's really kind of everybody working together. It's an international collaboration and he's always very open about this. And when he doesn't understand something, he has no problem saying that. So at some stage she doesn't quite understand Michael Faraday’s new theories and he doesn't quite get it. This is when he's quite old already. So you just get someone else to explain it to him, which I think shows any age 70, he goes back to university. Isn't that amazing? Because there is young geologists and young chemists who have all this new stuff to talk about. And how am I going to find this out? Well, I'm just going to sit at the lecture hall and I'm going to listen to it.And it's just brilliant. Michael Garfield (48m 32s): I actually wanted to raise that. It was Wilhelm his brother, right? Who founded the college that he then attended in his, his old age.Andrea Wulf (48m 40s): It's a fascinating university in Berlin, amazingly the Prussian capital didn't have a university until 1810. Michael Garfield (48m 48s): You talk about the students who would joke that, “oh, he's not in class today.” He must be advising the king because that's like when he was still on Royal dispensation, that is a lifetime learning to which I think we might all wish to aspire. And it is the kind of thing in an age of rapid change and explosive discovery. It does seem like that's what's demanded of us. He was right there at the threshold of being able to hold it all in himself. And at the end, the older he gets, the less he can rely on his own ability to traverse.It's not just political reasons. It's just, he's in an aging body and you start to see him almost become the organizing hub or the nucleus of this vast cybernetic research conglomerate. Andrea Wulf (49m 36s): If you think about like today, it's so difficult to be interdisciplinary, you know, as in one person, because everybody has to be so specialized. So instead of a Humboldt, we have to have groups of people, which I think this is the amazing thing about the Institute, because you have these people together and then, you get people. They even invite people like me, historians. You're not scientists because there is some cross-fertilization going on between all of this. And you never know about the serendipity of sitting next to someone at, at lunch talking about something you have absolutely no idea. Sometimes you also don't understand the word, but in a then you kind of ask and you ask more and then someone will explain it to you. And then it's almost like these little tentacles was to go into another discipline. And through that, it's like a little tube. You collect up a little bit of that knowledge. Just have to have enough of those tentacles to hold it all together I think. Someone will know something enough to feed the next person to get a little bit of that discipline.Michael Garfield (50m 42s): Thank you for listening. Complexities produced by the Santa Fe Institute, a nonprofit hub for complex systems science located in the high desert of New Mexico.

60,Episode Details / Transcript Andrea Wulf (0s): When he went to South America, one of the very first things he saw was a slave market. And he said that site has turned me into lifelong abolitionist and he writes about it very openly. There's permission off that Spanish King to travel through South America and repays him by very publicly criticizing Spanish rule there. As he travels through South America, he sees how the indigenous tribes are treated. He sees what missionaries are doing, how they treat the indigenous people so terribly. He sees slavery there. He sees how the land and the people are exploited and he writes about it. He never quite dares to tell Jefferson in his face, but everybody else in DC gets homeboy's like, why is this? This is not right, because he looks at the human race as part of nature. So there is no better or worse, no inferior or superior. And he at some stage says something like nature is this realm of liberty. And he applies that also to the human races. Michael Garfield (1m 24s): The 19th century saw many transformations, the origins of ecology and modern climatology, new unifying theories, the living world, the first big science projects, revolutions in the Spanish colonies, new information systems for the storage and representation of data. Many of these can be traced back to the influence of one singular explorer, Alexander Von Humboldt. Humboldt was one of the last true polymathic individuals in whom the sum of human knowledge could be seated. As the known world grew he leaned increasingly upon the work and minds of his collaborators, a kind of human bridge between the age of solitary pioneers before him and the age of international interdisciplinary research he helped usher into being. Reflecting on his life we natives of the new millennium, living through another phase, transition in the information architecture of society have much to learn about the challenges of weaving everything together into one holistic understanding. After all, when everything's connected, our individuality is cast in doubt. Truth is often hard to separate from politics and ethics and maverick explorers find themselves caught in between incumbent power and the burden of responsibility to act on what they learn. Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks, to explain the mysteries of the universe. This week, we conclude a special two-part conversation with SFI Miller scholar, Andrea Wulf, author of six books, including the New York times best seller, The Invention of Nature, Alexander Von Humboldt’s New World. In this episode, we build on our explorations in part one and talk about the conflicts between truth and power politics and science, the surprising unintended consequences of discovery, Humboldt's influence on scientific illustrator earns tackles development of the idea that nature is an art form, the role of embodiment in innovation, discovery and creativity and the effects of nature and the built environment on human thought.

Thank you for listening. Andrea Wulf (4m 4s): If you think about like today, it's so difficult to be interdisciplinary, as in one person, because everybody has to be so specialized. So instead of a Humboldt, we have to have groups of people, which I think this is the amazing thing about the Institute, because you have these people together and then, you get people, they even invite people like me, historians, who are not scientists, because there is some cross-fertilization going on between all of this. And you never, you just never know about the serendipity of sitting next to someone at, at lunch talking about something you have absolutely no idea. Sometimes you also don't understand the word really, but then you kind of ask and you ask more and then someone will explain it to you. And then it's almost like these little tentacles was go into another discipline. And through that, it's like a little cheap. You collect, suck up a little bit of that knowledge and just have to have lots of enough of those tentacles to hold it all together I think. Someone will know something enough to feed the next person to get a little bit of that discipline. Michael Garfield (5m 8s): It's funny that you speak this way because this really does get back to again where we started with thinking about the world, not as a machine, but as an organism. And so thinking about the scientific process, not as a machine, but as an organism, it almost looks like when I spoke with Chris Kempes on the show back in, I think episode 17, we were talking about the transition from unicellular life into multicellular life and how it's an information scaling thing. There comes a point when the cell becomes so big that it literally just can't copy all of its DNA in time to reproduce. That's like one of several different pressures that seem to produce these more narrowly specialized cells that become differentiated tissues and so on. And that sounds exactly like what you described in the movement from generalists to specialists. And then into, as that system scales, you get more and more intermediaries. There's specialists that are now specializing in translation, carry the blood cells. Andrea Wulf (6m 14s): Exactly. Then suddenly the communication becomes essential. Doesn't it? Because otherwise you have all these specialists, but no one can communicate with each other. I'm always amazed because when I think about who you interview, so you need to be able to think yourself into so many different topics to even ask these questions. Sometimes I just don't understand something. It's so far away from me. That's actually even hard to think of a question and to dig deeper. So you must have quite a kind of polymathic mind to be able to interview all these different people. Michael Garfield (6m 50s): There is something about having that time to wander in one's youth, I think. To bring this back around to specific SFI research, David Krakauer and Jessica Flack and Albert Kao have worked on stalemates and conflicts of interest. If it takes longer for a system to arrive at an answer, to perform a computation than it arrives at a better answer than if it settles on an answer prematurely, there are ways in which this kind of thinking can be applied to situations like Humboldt's early life, where he didn't have to decide what he was doing or where he was going to be. He wasn't pinned into a particular set of tasks. He was able to just wander and explore. And like you said, pivot to be out there in the field and on a lark, just go in a different direction and allow that kind of inspiration to guide him in the development of his associations and his maps. Andrea Wulf (7m 53s): That's how to be a wealthy Prussian aristocrat. Doesn't it? Michael Garfield (7m 56s): Exactly. And that's ultimately, when you talk about the etymological relationship between scholarship and leisure, there is a sense in which the university system was intended for this. It was intended to give people a space within which they could explore the world of knowledge in this way, and not merely as a preparation for pre-specified careers to bring this into contemporary situation and to ask about the future of education. You know, our director of education, Carrie Cowan has spoken about how the future seems like it's going to be more accommodating to a plurality of paths to normalize the gap year so that people can go climb a mountain and have an epiphany before they settle into their desk life. I think there's something to that. Andrea Wulf (8m 47s): I'm a great believer in very zig-zaggy routes to you in your careers. My career was never set to be out like this. There was point when a lot of people said to me,” oh, you're going to be a writer.” This is just a really bad jobs choice. And then, there were years when it was, but it was the right decision. If I look at my schooling and I think a lot of people have experienced as well. I think one of the big issues, one of the big problems in our education system, at least in the UK and also in Germany, I don't know how it is in the U. S. but I think as symbolize that very early on, you get put into this box of arts or science. You are either rational, logical, or you're creative and artistic. So I was put into the creative artistic box very early on because I'm not very good with numbers. So I was not very good in all the science subjects. And I'm pretty sure that my science teacher would turn in their graves if they knew that, for example, I wonder Royal Society Science Book Prize. How dare she write about the history of science? She does not have a clue about science. And I will say that I was told wrongly. I have actually, by now understood a lot of science. I was just taught wrongly. I need to be led into these complicated issues through a story. I got interested in the history of science through the story of these people. So I'm a people's person. I need this hooked on a person. And then you can take me down these labyrinthian difficult, difficult routes. It's the same with when I'm doing philosophy now like Hagle, well, it's difficult, but I'm going along with it because there's a reason for it. And so I think one of the problems we have is that in our education system, we already tell children that you have to decide very, very early on. Now, how can you decide as a six-year-old or as a 16-year-old, what you're going to do? Why do I have to decide to do either this or that? And if you look back there, it's a very recent distinction. Look at someone like Goethe, for example, a whole lot of Leonardo da Vinci, you know, all these people never had to make a decision between the arts and the sciences. And I think if the education system changes and it allows us these gap years where you can wander where you can think, then I think it's all the better. I know a lot of people in my generation who were much more straightforward in their careers, then knew exactly what they are going to do. They studies, they had that job. Now in their fifties they're deeply unhappy, quite a lot of them because they've basically powered themselves out. There's nothing left. Well, I have the feeling that I'm just starting. There's so many other things I want to write about. And frankly, I'm going to write until the pen falls out of my fingers, or I fall off the chair when I'm that old. So it's that sense of finding really the thing, having the privilege. Let's just also say that having the privilege to find what you really want to do, and that makes you happy. That's incredible. And I think Humboldt was lucky in that sense too. He found what he wanted to do like in his mother died early enough, so he could afford doing this journey, but it's also grabbing them what you have and doing something with it and taking the risks. He took a lot of risks. He could have had a very comfortable life as a Prussian aristocrat. He risked his life almost every single day on this exploration. Michael Garfield (12m 14s): So I want to get into that because there's another dimension in the sense that fellow Miller scholar, John Kaag talks about the Aristotelian golden meme in some of his writing. When I think about that, finding the thresholds and the balance points, I mean, this is something that complex systems science is rather preoccupied with finding sweet spots and critical transitions. There is carrying it too far. You can take maybe a gap year, but if you were to take a gap decade, the path that you cut through the world might be too tangled for you to properly ever return to society. You talk about this in the book and it's fascinating. Upon returning from South America, Humboldt just did not fit in, in his homeland anymore. He only felt if he's not out in the wilderness exploring, he's really only at home in Paris where there's this boiling intellectual activity, lots of international Congress of ideas. From that point forward, most of his aspirations were foiled or frustrated or complicated in some way, by the political milieu into which she had to reintegrate. And ultimately really couldn't his service to pressure and royalty is being part of it, his conflict with the east India tea company in British colonial operations. But then also in his early life, he was able to travel on his own dime through South America. And then as he gets older, he wants to go east into Russia. He has to go at the expense of desire and he's like escaping. He's like deviating from the agenda to go off on his own exploration, courting disaster. The more he let the wilderness into him, the more he became a creature of the world and rather not so much a creature of the street level world that his family and everyone else was occupying. The more conflict he found himself in all of these, it seems like this political intrigue going on around him. Andrea Wulf (14m 17s): I think it's actually Humboldt, very strange. He can be quite diplomatic. And I think his entire life is this balancing act between what he wants to do and what he can do. So he's a visionary, he's a really kind of quite revolutionary, but he still acts within the accepted norm, not entirely all the time, but within that. As he traveled through South America, for example, he is definitely more flexible than if he'd be on a big government expedition, but he still has to get permissions from the local governors from the Viceroys. First of all, he has to get the permission from the Spanish king. As he goes along, he has a passport that gets stamped. So he has to negotiate the kind of the local rulers in order to do stuff. And he's very good at that because he's quite diplomatic and he’s quite charming. And then later it becomes even more difficult on that trip to Russia, because he's really watched by the Czar officials. So he deviates from the route, he does his kind of detours, but again and again, in his life, he has that problem. And then it really becomes very obvious in 1848, which is the time of the German revolutions and where there is a moment he's the premier counselor to the Prussian king. But at the same time, he's outspoken. He's written a lot about the South American Bolivar’s revolution. He is a great fan of the American revolution of the French Revolution. So he’s really a child of the revolutionary age. So his political ideas are with the revolutionaries. One day, he stands at the back of the balcony behind the Prussian King, as the Prussian King is addressing the revolutionaries in 1848. And the next day he's marching in the first row of the funeral to the fallen revolutionaries. A lot of people who criticize him for that, that he's someone who says like, “oh, homeboy,” you know, always he's a Republican who was like one foot in the enter chamber of the king. So they see that this is problematic, but until he dies, he's basically trying to act within that constraint of society because I think you is that there's no other option, really. So he is a revolutionary, but he doesn't like the mop. He doesn't like bloody revolutions. He still like some older and control. The bloodshed that happens then later on in South America. And then when Bolivar declared himself dictator, that is something where Humboldt is very critical about. He admires the American revolution, but at the same time, he's a lifelong abolitionists. So when he is older and he has all these young American scientists visiting him in Berlin, he asks every single one about what's going on. Why do you still have slavery again and again, because, and he says, so when he went to South America, one of the very first things he saw was a slave market. And he said that side has made me turn me into lifelong abolitionist. And he writes about it very openly. In his books there's permission off the Spanish King to travel through south America and repays him, repays the cake by very publicly criticizing Spanish rule there. As he travels through South America, he sees how the indigenous tribes are treated. He sees what missionaries are doing, how they really treat the indigenous people so terribly. He sees how slavery there. He sees how the land and the people I exploited. And he writes about it. He never quite dares to tell Jefferson in his face, but everybody else in DC gets home, was like, you know, why is this? This is not right, because they're no superior racist. He says, because he looks at the human race as part of nature. So there is no better or worse, no inferior or superior. And he at some stage says something like nature is this realm of liberty. And he applies that also to the human races. Michael Garfield (18m 27s): This is on display time and time again in great scientists and philosophers, this tension between natural law and human law, biting the hand that feeds you. You get government funded research or government approved research. And then my loyalty is to the truth. You paint such a rich portrait of how his ecology informed his ethics. I'm glad we got here because it's not just slavery. It's also local food production and subsistence farming versus cash crops, anti-deforestation, critical of dams, generally an anti-colonialist thinker. It's funny because I see in Humboldt's work something kind of like what we saw with Albert Einstein, where his ideas end up accidentally creating this horror, this emancipatory philosophy that he espouses, like you said, the revolutionaries in Prussia, that he can point to a different way of seeing things, but he doesn't lead people through it bloodlessly. And you see the same thing with like Einstein sort of pivoting into like anti-nuclear oversight and all of this stuff. It's like an attempt to mop up, knock on effects of his problem child. Andrea Wulf (19m 50s): There's one extraordinary example where, because he's a scientist he's interested in a lot of different things. He was a mining inspector in his youth in Germany, and he inspects minds as he travels through Mexico. And there's this terrible thing that happens where basically speculators later use his information to speculate in Mexican silver, and he's appalled by it. And then there's this other thing where he brings back someone from Peru and the European scientists realized that this is a great fertilizer, which then results in, first of all, the Peruvian farmers don't have it anymore who just used a little bit of it. And it just destroys an entire ecosystem and hormone kind of regrets these things very much so because he's in search of truth. But I think because he's such a system thinker, he also understands these connections. I mean, we haven't really talked about this, but one of the reasons why I wrote this book, because really the forgotten father of environmentalism, and that was my starting point with all of this, because that's what speaks to my soul. Why have we destroyed this planet so much? So, and as a historian, I want to know where's this all coming from or who tried to help already before? So Humboldt as he traveled through South America, because he sees these connections to nature actually sees how humankind is destroying nature. So there's this historian a moment at Lake Valencia, which is in today's Venezuela, which was this very rich agricultural region. And he sees how deforestation has completely destroyed this area. And as he's there, he understands. And he's the very first to explain the fundamental functions of the forest for the ecosystem, without using the word ecosystem, because the term actually was then coined by Ernst Haeckel later on inspired by Humboldt. But he understands that trees enriched the atmosphere that they store water, that they protect against soil erosion. He starts to speak out against monoculture, irrigation, deforestation, because he understands what the long-term effect is of that that is so extraordinary and that it actually predicts harmful human induced climate change, which is just insane if you think about it. He couldn't know the effect of CO2, but he talks about the effect of the steam that comes out of industrial centers, for example. So he is someone who understands this when he travels through South America. He sees what happened when trees are taken away from river banks, how that destroys the river. He sees how missionaries collect X of turtles at the Orinoco, which they used to oil off the turtle eggs for their lambs and how then the locals tell him that every year there are less and less turtle eggs, because of course the missionaries just take what they want. So he develops this ecological understanding, which I would also argue helps and is informed by his very close contact with indigenous people. So his idea of earth as a living organism is something that comes out of Yana. But I think it is something that's then confirmed and pushed in even harder direction through the contact he has with the indigenous people. He travels with a very small team, so that sometimes only two or three people with him. They're his guides. And he, again and again, talks about how they are the best observers of nature, the best geographers, because he relies on their knowledge. So I think that living organism that everything hangs together, that's partly the kind of German nature philosophy, and partly the indigenous knowledge he encounters in South America. Michael Garfield (23m 34s): That's perfect because that brings us right to the hail Mary pass. I wanted to throw here, which is this work about this seminal historic figure, a visionary, a pioneer, an innovator is also about the development of a way of seeing the world and of being in the world that in part undermines that kind of great man narrative structure. You do a great job of, of explaining this in the chapter on Charles Darwin and the way that Darwin was influenced by not only by Humboldt, but by the enormous body of thinking on the transmutation of species that existed at that time and his own grandfather, Erasmus, Darwin, Lamarck all these other people really just the way that we currently seem to like to tell these stories, again, this gets back to like the narrative compression of information is someone was sitting at their desk and had a great idea. Really all the pieces were there already, which is why you get that code discovery. It just as a side note, you get the co-discovery of natural selection by Alfred Russel Wallace. It's interesting. When you talk about the privilege that Humboldt had and his ability to take the time to develop his ideas. Wallace was like blue collar specimen collector working in the South Pacific, who did not have the family backing the wealth and the luxury, the leisure to develop these ideas, except on the side. There's something about, ultimately, even though this is a story about a deeply important, in many ways under- appreciated, at least in the United States individual it's also a story about the communal enterprise of discovery and how none of these people really were capable of doing this on their own. And we completely leave out the indigenous piece of this in so many accounts of scientific discovery. I'm glad you brought that up. Andrea Wulf (25m 36s): So I think there are several things. One weirdly, no one quite believes me, but this is for me is not biography of Alexander Humboldt. IT’s a biography of an idea. That's why the book is called the invention of nature, which of course he didn't invent. And that's why I have eight chapters in there about the people who were influenced by Humboldt, because I was interested in how do these ideas travel through history? Humboldt did a lot of things that he never finished. For example, all his ideas about environmentalism. He never became an activist. It's then people like John Muir or George Perkins Marsh, who kind of pick up these ideas and follow it through. For me, I'm really glad that you brought this up because it's something that a lot of people don't actually understand. This is not a biography about this great white man at all. This is a biography about an idea and also about how this came from so many different people, because Humboldt, one of the reasons I would argue that he's not famous anymore today is because there's not one big discovery attached to his name. It didn't come up with a theory of evolution. He didn't discover a planet or natural law. And none of this stuff he comes up with is plucked out of the nothingness. Everything is floating around. What he is doing is he's putting a lot of stuff together that's floating around. He sees a lot of things on his travels that other people who sit in their kind of little study, don't see. So he can actually put these things together. And he's a great communicator. These ideas are there. So for example, shelling with his idea of nature philosophy in the unity, but is Humboldt who takes that and then applies it to science and to nature and explains it in a way in his bestselling books, that it reaches a huge audience and talking about like the army of people who's helping him because he relies on that. And he always talks about it. And it's the same with indigenous people. The big problem we have as historians is that we have very, very little documentation about this, which is one of the reasons I think why they get a smaller place than they should have, because even people like Humboldt, don't think they're important enough to kind of write about. So when you look at his very lavish books, there's engravings in his landscape engravings, he draws them. So, they are not devoid of them. He writes about them a bit in his diaries for us to really properly write about them. Not enough. There's a very long section, for example, in his diary where he describes the production of Curare poison and where he describes how the shaman does it. And it goes on for pages and pages, because he's absolutely fascinated by it. He's interested in, you must try. You know, he's like all these things he wants to, he wants to experience, he wants to learn. And the, in the indigenous people are his, are his guides. There's one scene where one of them, they can distinguish 15 different types of trees by eating the bark. And of course Humboldt has to kind of try it and is  it all tastes the same. How can they do that? There's a lot of that. So for me, this is why the title is not Alexandra Von Humboldt’s life, but the title is the invention of nature. Michael Garfield (28m 51s): It feels like the perfect time to get into some of that last piece of your book on the impact of his ideas and his work broadly. We've already touched on Darwin, but I do want to make sure that we get to Ernst Haeckel because Haeckel as perhaps the sort of err scientific illustrator holotypic individual, aside from, like you said, coining the word ecosystem is also deeply influential in ways that are kind of largely invisible or subterranean to people in terms of his influence on the way that we think about this stuff. I want to toss it over to you, but just briefly after saying earlier, when you were talking about extending a tentacle or out between one mind and another mind in this multicellular knowledge project. This reminds me of a documentary that was made about Haeckel’s life Proteus in which they situate his work on the descriptions and illustrations of deep sea and vertebrates that political and economic context that created that, which was, we were trying to lay that telegraph cable across the Atlantic in order to communicate stock prices between New York and London, they kept breaking the cable and having to dredge it back up and finding out that our beliefs about the ocean floor were completely wrong. We thought it was this frozen wasteland and it was fall of life. And these cables were in crusted with things that is where this documentary Proteus puts that threshold moment, where they start to articulate Haeckel’s development of nature itself as an art form, as an artwork, as a product of a kind of mathematical cosmic intelligence. This is again like here there be tigers. As far as this being a conversation about complex systems science. Multi-scale thinking this deepening revelation of the living world as an organism does tend to lend itself to this lofty thinking that results not only in gorgeous architecture, like you show by his illustrations, that beginnings of what we might think of now is sort of like biomimicry in architecture, but also lends itself to this understanding of humanity as participating in a mentation greater than our own. Andrea Wulf (31m 10s): I can't remember the last time someone asked me about Ernst Haeckel is so weird. It's one of the chapters I never really get asked about. You just suddenly kind of brought me back to it because I loved writing that chapter. And I loved writing the research because it was so rich and so different. I think he's an extraordinary scientist who believe it or not was also in Yena, but it just much later. So there's something going on in that little one there, but I mean, he's much much later there. He's this young scientist who was completely obsessed with humbled and reads his books. And he has like a humbled portray in his study and on Humboldt’s birthday, like a wreath rounded it, is forced by his parents to become a doctor and he hated, it kind of basically eventually ends up studying marine organisms. And he has that incredible talent, which I've talked to quite a lot of people about it, which is, seems to be very, very rare that he could look in the microscope with one eye and the other eye could be on the paper so he could draw, which when you look at his incredible paintings, you understand that it's not possible, can't be possible otherwise, but there are so stunningly beautiful. And I think he was, again, someone who makes sense of nature with a pen in his hands. He needs to draw it, to actually understand it. He draws these incredible tiny, tiny marine organisms, which he can only see through a microscope, publishes them as these large, beautiful colored plates. It's like a magazine which comes out in several parts and people love it. It becomes something very important. I think that's what interested me also very much is becomes an inspiration for artists, for architects, for furniture designers. So Tiffany, for example, Louis Tiffany is obsessed with him. And a lot of his lambs and jewelry is kind of inspired by that this kind of the kind of quality of these organisms. There's something so beautiful and alive in it. So art nouveau is inspired by these tentacles, by these curvaceous, by this kind of these shapes from nature. And, and this is at a time when the machine age takes over. So we feel this loss, this, this connection to nature. Haeckel provides them through a science with something that becomes part of a very different aspect of life. And that great moment when at one of the, and I forgot which year it is because it's like seven years ago that I did the research for that. But in one of those Paris expositions, the gate was a French architect kind of created and people could work through it. It was like a single cell organism just kind of blown up and people were absolutely enthralled by it because they had never seen anything like it. For Haeckel give really becomes a believer in monoideism. So he sees that there's this one divine force in everything that God has kind of everything is one because he's internalized this idea of the living organism and interesting, Humboldt for example, is someone who never writes about God or religion. So he kind of think in his very diplomatic way keeps out of it. I think Humboldt was an atheist. You know, he believes in a life force, but not in a divine force where Haeckel believes in the divine. There's another aspect to that. Michael Garfield (34m 44s): I love there's a section prior to this, where you talk about Humboldt describing the germination, blooming foliage, fecundity, fading, withering, and corruption of stars, which is again like a gesture towards, you talk again and again, how he's decentering human exceptionalism in this network, ecological worldview, and this is a Copernican move, right? It's moving us sort of off to the side to participate in a much greater thing. And he's doing that in time there too. And so again, this rings with me into ways. I feel like SFI attracts a lot of weird people, not just people here on campus, not the people doing the research, but tilting a spear after really profound questions tends to invite a lot of usually adorable lunacy. And one of them, I would say, honey traps for that kind of thing is in this conversation around the collective computation of societies, the notion of all of human civilization, as like a giant single superorganism having its own thoughts that are ineffable to us. Whether you want to talk about God or not, it does still reach out into, you know, the point where you can, as Haeckel did talk about Koons foreman, art forms in nature. I mean, this is so confused now because people are so polarized and touchy around the difference between evolution by blind forces of natural selection and random mutation and the idea of intelligent design. But then you get people like Michael Levin, who came and spoke here recently, Tufts developmental biologists, collaborator of SFI, external professor, Daniel Dennett, who's working on stuff that seems positively 19th century like the role of electromagnetic fields in governing the development of organisms, like the regeneration of limbs and the coordination of tissues and being able to use fields to shape the ontogeny. Dennett and Levin just wrote this fabulous piece for Ayaan a couple months ago about cognition all the way down. The idea that we're not just talking about thinking brains, we're talking about thinking cells. I've heard our president, David Krakauer talk about a kind of complex systems panpsychism that you can accept once you think of cognition as a property of adaptive matter, rather than something that is like locked up in one given scale or one given substrate. Andrea Wulf (37m 26s): That's why I'm totally obsessed with that Merlin Sheldrake book Entangled Life, because that's exactly what he's talking about. Once you leave, you're kind of preconceived categorie,s suddenly everything's just open up and he's also one of those scientists who says you need to use imagination because you need to leave these categories behind to understand there's a whole, now it's become accepted knowledge of world wide web. But when they started out with that, everybody's thought those early scientists were completely mad. Trees are communicating with each other. It's just kind of mad. And I think when you started looking about fungal systems, then it just goes, there's a whole other world of there. And we just have to open our minds. And someone like Humboldt was someone who just very open to anything, any possibility. You just let your mind roam. And very often there's a dead end, but then you just start again and start again, rather than going on that, that one motorway you have. That's why I think zigzagging is so good because only when you get off and go one, but, and down one of those kinds of dead ends, you will find like this path that leads you somewhere else. Michael Garfield (38m 38s): I feel like the place to bring this down for a landing is in embodiment of understanding and knowledge and cognition. You just mentioned thinking with a pen in your hand. I consider what we're doing here a form of kind of like termite collaborative mound building. We're creating a conceptual object that emerges somehow from between us, but we're just sitting here throughout the entire record of great scientific discovery. You hear, “oh, I was going for a walk.” And you talk about Wordsworth and Coleridge is walking poets. And I think that just for those who have been sitting at a desk, listening to us for this whole conversation, this seems like a good place to invoke the movement of the body as a cognitive act as like a part of the process of, of discovery. And I'd just love to hear you wax on that for a bit. Andrea Wulf (39m 32s): Humboldt would always say, “I don't want to be one of those geologists who judged the creation of the earth by looking at the local hill.” One thing is to kind of get out and see and feel. I give you an example for me to do my research for this book I think might be an example for this, why I really believe that you have to put your body out there. So it became pretty clear pretty early on for me that I will not be able to write this book if I've not actually seen some of these landscapes. What I thought I need to see them in order to describe them to make sense of them, whereas what kind of more intellectually almost, but then actually it turned out that was a much more visceral experience, much more physical. For example, going up to Chimborazo for me was, and it sounds maybe a little bit esoteric, but what I'd done is like I read the diary beforehand and then I decided, you know, these are the points I need to see. And then I took the transcriptions of those parts of Humboldt’s journey with me. So when I went to the Orinoco or to Chimborazo, then I would kind of reach wherever I needed to go and then read what he had read. So it was this very strange intellectual and physical experience where I really felt I was coming closer to him than if I'd not done that because his diary made so much more sense by breathing thin air. Once you are at 16,500 feet, your brain just doesn't work quite as well anymore. And then reading something and then you suddenly realize what he did. For example, paddling down the Orinoco was I had never been to the rainforest and I was so excited to go to the rainforest and it was kind of exciting for a day. And then I suddenly realized because I'm not a botanist. I’m not a biologist, it's just a big green wall. It doesn't, you know, nothing made sense. And there was none of that overview and you would just attack by mosquitoes the whole time. So it's something that comes up and in my writing, because I suddenly realized that homework and almost every single diary entry, he writes the mosquitoes. So the mosquitoes featured in the book, which probably would have not featured if I'd not been with my body in that place. Sometimes I have a writer's block when I go for a walk and I think, “oh, well maybe now something's going to come.” And nothing's going to. It's only, I mean, for me, it happens when I, when I put my hands on the soil and I garden, then it happens more. Sometimes weeks later, there's never an epiphany where I like, oh, I need to run inside and write this paragraph. But I do think that physicality and intellect belong together because in a way our thinking is in our body somehow, also, so is connected. So it is completely logical that that should happen in effect. And it's very strange in this pandemic, for example. This is a book, you know, the last 14 months, I basically sat on this chair, writing this book and it turned out that this is a book, the new book is a book about the self and weirdly I've written it in this very enclosed just with myself way. So I don't know if that has an effect on the writing of the book. I don't know, but it kind of feels like the pandemic had happened while I was riding the Humboldt, but we would have been an absolute disaster because I was out in the world for years, traveling across the South America and America. And this has been very much physically also what it is intellectually, just about, you know, the world through the prison of my mind. Michael Garfield (43m 6s): Well, I mean, there's a reason that churches have tall ceilings, right? The influence of the built environment on our thought processes is real, which is why when you talk about this, you talk about throw in this and Walden, you bring this up also in relation to Haeckel and his talk about urban flight from the polluted European cities of the latter 19th century, people just being desperate to get out. I remember in high school, I was given a creative writing assignment on the transcendentalists to just go out and sit behind my house. And I remember sitting there in like a, kind of a wooded area and just being annoyed by the sounds of car traffic and airplanes flying overhead until it clicked for me, which is unity of the human and the natural world. And so like, that's a kind of a revelation that can only happen when we are living in the wake of these discoveries and their consequences when the natural world inspires architecture and design and brings some kind of warmth and organic quality into the environments that we have created for ourselves after hundreds of years of pushing all that stuff out and seeking this like orderly regulated linear kind of world space around us. So it's just in a way it's hopeful to urban planning and sustainable design and all of this as a consequence, ultimately of the impact that all of these people that you've written about have had on society, bringing nature, as we now think of it back into cities in a way, because we understand having trees improves academic outcomes. People in treeless neighborhoods are dying from mental disorders from not being surrounded by nature. In a way where we're stuck. Things are going to look very different. Moving forward the world has integrated some of Humboldt's world we've taken up enough of it to start asking ourselves questions about what it means to be able to have that kind of indigenous appreciation for the systems in which we exist without having to leave the city. Andrea Wulf (45m 23s): One of the things is I've always thought that it's quite important. It's not just about going into the wilderness and that's very much white privilege. You can go and spend a lovely time in a national park or go up the Andes or something like that. Very few people. So in order to make this world better, we have to bring nature also into cities like cities have to be livable. That's incredibly important. And sometimes I have a problem with this whole kind of wilderness obsession. I think what is very, very important to actually set aside quite a lot of wilderness so that we kind of keep our biodiversity, but not for us to go and visit, but just to leave it undisturbed. For me when the pandemic started, the thing that kept me sane, I mean, I've always written about nature. I've written about gardens and everything. I've never had a garden. I've never had a kind of like vegetable garden. So I got stuck in Germany and I created out of nothing, basically only using recycled material, which I could find that in the neighborhood, like on the neighboring estate here, I built like a really big, big vegetable garden. And that kept me sane. So saying that I don't know where I would have been otherwise because there was something and we were so lucky about the weather here and like this year where it's terrible this spring, but you know, you put these shriveled seeds into the soil and it's such a cliche and there's a reason why it's a cliche because it works because there's something that does, it happens to you and you put a seed and then you grow your spinach, you eat it. And it's just so satisfying. For me, that's a human right. Every single human has, should have the right and access to nature in one way or another. It's incredibly important for our sanity. Because if you think about it, our imagination was full 10,000 generations ago in nature. It's in our DNA. We need to be connected to nature. Michael Garfield (47m 19s): And not just a pandemic potted plant obsession. Andrea Wulf (47m 22s): Hang a little bit more. So I'd like to think that we are in this now and it's terrible, but I think we are also all incredibly tired about it. And there needs to be a sense of not everything that happens now can be determined by having lived through a pandemic in a day. There is something else, also something actually much more important climate change. And we really need to tackle that. We can't just forget that. That's the bit I'm really depressed about, but that is only going to work. I think if we make, keep people care about nature, so otherwise it's going to work. Michael Garfield (47m 55s): Well, this has been a total blast. I'm deeply grateful that we managed to finally get it together. I'm sorry. It took so long, like a year and a half. Andrea Wulf (48m 4s): Because it was before we could because of the pandemic. Michael Garfield (48m 8s): I remember asking you in person on campus, if we could do this. Andrea Wulf (48m 12s): Well, I hope I can come back. I should be back next week. Michael Garfield (48m 17s): Then we can have a conversation about fierce individualism. Thank you so much for being on. Thank you so much. Thank you for listening.

61,Episode Details / Transcript Mark Ritchie (0s): Kind of my m.o. is when somebody throws a question at me that doesn't have a very clear answer, but is clearly important. My curiosity gets piqued. And so I don't really pay that much attention to the fact that I don't know much about it. I just start reading. So as I dug into the physiology, to the biochemistry involved in what causes plants to be good to eat or not, I discovered that our understanding of how temperature affects biochemistry is incomplete and not really well thought out. And not really, as we know now in very much agreement with the data.So that's what led me to literally start from the ground up, looking at enzyme kinetics and how that all might scale up to determine something like the nitrogen content of a plant leaf. And so in the process, I linked in with some of these ideas and complexity theory, which actually turned out to be tools that enable me to set up the problem. And then I could find solutions that you might expect evolution to favor by solving for the state at which you get maximum entropy production. Michael Garfield (1m 24s): Deep inside yourselves the chemistry of life is hard at work to make the raw materials and channel the energy required for growth, maintenance and reproduction. Few systems are as intricate or as mysterious. For this reason how a cell does what it does remains a frontier for research. And consequently, theory often grows unchecked by solid data. Most of what we know about the enzymatic processes of plant and animal metabolisms comes from test tube experiments, not studies in the context of a living organism.How much has this necessarily reductionist approach mislead us and what changes when we zoom out and think about life's manufacturing and distribution in situ? Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network, rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week, we opened a two-part discussion with ecologist, Mark Ritchie of Syracuse University on how he and his SFI collaborators are starting to rethink the intersections of thermodynamics in biology to better fit our scientific models to the patterns we observe in nature. Beginning with his history of research, into biodiversity, environmental science and plant herbivore dynamics, this conversation leads us to his latest work on photosynthesis and scaling laws and cells and inquiry with potent implications that far beyond the microscopic realm to economics and the future of sustainability. Subscribe to Complexity, to stay tuned for part two, in which we travel even deeper into how Mark's work relates to other SFI research and what his new perspectives may reveal about the nature of the complex crises faced by both human beings and the biosphere at large.

Thank you for listening.Michael Garfield (3m 43s): All right, well, Mark Ritchie, it's a pleasure to have you on complexity podcast, Mark Ritchie (3m 48s): Delightedto be here at SFI. It's always been a place I've loved to come here several times over the years, even did us short sabbatical here a really long time ago, but it's definitely be fun to sit and talk about science and the world and all that good stuff.Michael Garfield (4m 3s): I'd like to start where we start typically, which is on the ground in the human. A little bit of biography. It would be good to know your story, like how you got into your life as a scientist, and specifically what animated your passion, the specific topics that you've decided to spend your life researching.Mark Ritchie (4m 24s): That's pretty interesting. So I grew up in San Antonio, Texas in the seventies, and like many other reasonably good students who were interested in biology the only career that anyone ever thought of was pre-med health, science type stuff. Most people had never even heard of ecology or environmental science at that time. So I started that as an undergrad, which actually started a year early. I skipped my senior year of high school. So I was taking some classes at University of Texas at San Antonio, and one of the required classes was an ecology class.So we had to go out and do labs. Like we put paint on ants and use something called a mark recapture method for estimating how many ants were in an ant nest. So after we'd done about four or five of these labs, I went into the professor and I said, “I think I found what I want to do. I want to be an ecologist. And he looked at me, he goes, “nah, you don't want to be an ecologist. The best you can hope for is that, you know, you just kind of turn out to be a teacher. And it's nothing very exciting.” And I'm like, well, I don't care because I know I was born to do this.Because I said, I've been spending my whole life thinking about all these kinds of questions that a college asks. Then he looked at me, smile said, okay, great, welcome to the team. And I started doing projects that were related to plants. So then I have the opportunity to finish my undergrad at Indiana University, where I took another class called population biology. And that's where I started falling in love with the idea of using mathematics in ecology. So I actually wrote two papers that semester on using math to look at succession and plants and stuff like that.So then when I went to grad school, which was at the University of Michigan, I was working with professor Gary Biloski who was really into sort of connecting the idea of forging behavior of animals to these larger phenomenon, like population growth and community organization, which are all of these really tough questions that ecologists still haven't really figured out how to solve. So I did work on animal foraging and then later as a post-doc, which I did with Dave Tilman and I sort of took that basis. And then I scaled it up to sort of looking at herbivore effects on plant communities, which was sort of a big hole in the Tilman research effort at that time.And so after my postdoc and I started at Utah State University, then there are all these Western grazing issues of our wildlife competing with cattle and or cattle destroying the landscape. And then I was combining that with some of the work that I did at Cedar Creek, where we discovered that herbivores are having these big effects on nitrogen cycling that in retrospect seems sort of obvious, but at the time people were just kind of discovering that. And so that's kind of led me to kind of always have a thread of herbivore plant soil interactions, looking at everything from nutrient cycling up to diet decision-making kinds of things.And so then one of the questions that came up as I was a junior faculty member was I was looking at coexistence to grasshopper species. So I was creating these cages with pairwise species combinations. And I noticed that if I did the experiment early in the season, when the vegetation was pretty uniformly, good to eat, that one of the species would wipe out the other one. But if I did the same experiment later in the season, when the plants had grown up more and more, much more sort of spatially complex with leaves and stems and that kind of thing, that the grasshoppers species always co-existed.So try and understand why would get these different experimental outcomes to make a long story short led me to start looking at the role of fractal geometry as a way of quantifying complexity in nature. So that eventually led after about eight years of various stops and starts. But including the time that I spent at SFI for about six weeks in late spring, where it was just me and I could get up at 6:00 AM and I said, “Hey, I'm at SFI. I can think about anything.”Nothing is too crazy. So that eventually led to me writing a book or prince the monograph, where I sort of laid out the idea that you can quantify nature, a lot of nature as first approximation, as a fractal distribution, over a limited range of scales. And that turns out to be a really useful way of quantifying spatial heterogeneity or like how things are different in space and then how organisms with different sizes. They sample that encounter very different kinds of environments. So some are very much focused on the little details and others are only after big clusters of things.So that led to looking at biodiversity from this kind of bottom up functional perspective of an individual moving through a spatially complex environment. Then later I started thinking about temperature because people started asking me questions about, well, so how does changing temperature affect these planters or interactions? And we know that one of the key things that mediates those interactions is how good are plants to eat. So some plants have high nutrient content by sugar content. Herbivores really liked to eat them and literally eat almost all of the whatever leaves and stuff that are available.And other plants are not very good to eat that you have chemicals or they're really tough or they're thorns or something like that. And so the idea was how would temperature affect whether a lot of the plants that were available would be eaten or just avoided. So I started digging around in the, I guess this is kind of my m.o. is when somebody throws a question at me that doesn't have a very clear answer, but is clearly important than like curiosity gets piqued. And so I don't really pay that much attention to the fact that I don't know much about it from the start.I just start reading. So as I dug into the physiology, to the biochemistry involved in what causes plants to be good to eat or not, I discovered that our understanding of how temperature affects biochemistry is well, just to put a fine point on it as I said in my talk is sort of incomplete and not really well thought out and not really, as we know now in very much agreement with the data. So that's what led me to literally start from the ground up, looking at enzyme kinetics and how that all might scale up to determine something like the nitrogen content of a plant leaf.And so in the process, then again, I linked in with some of these ideas and complexity theory, such as thermodynamics and entropy production and those kinds of things, which actually turned out to be tools that enable me to solve the problem. I could set up the problem. And then I could find solutions that you might expect evolution to favor by solving for the state of what you get maximum entropy production. And so from that, we generated a bunch of interesting predictions about how different things should respond to temperature that seemed to agree with data initially.And so that's kind of where I've ended up on that question, but I think hopefully with all of this storytelling here, that you can see that I'm always intrigued by questions and problems and not really stuck on any particular system. That's just what gets me out of bed in the morning. It's like, this is the kind of problem that I'll wake up at three in the morning, thinking about wheels are turning. And that's what excites me about science. It's not about how much grants you get or how many grad students I have. It's about thinking about really hard and deep problems and trying to figure out some way to solve.,Michael Garfield (11m 57s): There's an enormous span thereAnd I hope why back over it. At least most of it, you gave us a really clear, not a linear path per se, but at least you mapped the random walk that you took from topic to topic. And I gotta say it rhymes a lot with the conversation that I had recently with Sid Redner on the show where you wanted to study all of these kind of mundane problems. Like how do you beat your kid at a game of war? Where do you find the best parking spot? And that's why I like asking these questions at the opening of the show, because something I would love to hear more of from science communication broadly is how the hypothesis is even selected.And then how the domain of interest within which you generate a hypothesis is selected. That's something that's like oddly ignored in the first pass education on scientific methodology I feel. So at any rate you gave a talk at SFI recently on this last subject that you just mentioned on the relationship between temperature and enzyme activity. And I would like to dig in with that one a little bit, because I feel like through there, we can cast out some tendrils and connect it to some other ideas and complex systems science.And you can tell me what you think sticks and what doesn't. As far as we research the things that are imminently important, like cattle grazing or global food production under the conditions of global warming. This is something I think a lot of people will find deeply relevant to their continued existence. Let's start with the way that biochemistry has traditionally described this system and this process, and then why that doesn't make sense.Mark Ritchie (13m 44s): Okay, well, if you just Google like biochemistry and thermodynamics, and you look at almost any basic biochemistry textbook, and you look at several hundreds of papers that measure what are called thermodynamic properties of enzymes, almost all of it is directed at the reaction that the enzymes catalyze going forward readily, or is it more difficult to happen? And so you can essentially measure that as a change in heat that happens.So we talk about something called like an exothermic reaction that requires, or that generates heat processes as it goes. Any process that does that so you start with two molecules or you start with enzyme in a molecule and the enzyme breaks the molecule into two pieces and generates heat. Well from the very basic definitions of entropy, that's an increase in entropy in that local area. So most of biochemistry is designed to say, so if I do this reaction, is it generating a lot of heat or is it not?And if it is then it's usually a favorable reaction that tends to happen without a whole of trouble. And even the most basic respiration reaction, so-called burning glucose, is really just a series of sort of chopping molecules off of a larger molecule and the series of steps that releases heat or allows the formation of ATP, which then later as phosphates chopped off of it to release heat work, the cell wants it to be, so this whole issue about whether reactions are favorable or unfavorable and just how favorable or unfavorable they are is kind of really where thermodynamics and biochemistry has been for five decades or so.And look, those even back to the thirties, when people started doing all of this, and then there was this kind of this cottage industry of taking a different enzyme or taking an enzyme from a different organism that does the same function as the one, like one in bacteria, like e-coli is a standard lab organism and comparing, is this one more likely, less likely at what point does the enzyme stop working? So I think where I was making progress on the problem was that I wasn't really asking the question of the reaction going forward or not.What I was asking is I'm sitting here looking at it from the whole cells perspective and a cell doesn't really want to increase entropy the cell from an anthropomorphic point of view, iIt wants to keep its organization, doesn't want it to fall apart. And we all know that cells don't just burn energy and then stop. They're continually taking in materials and doing work and getting rid of materials that can't use and dissipating heat to the environment. And all of that is going on while the cell continues to exist.So this is where I started saying is that we really wanting to know is not just simply or not whether or not a reaction is going forward, because it's easy for it to generate entropy. The issue is what does cell doing with all those things that are increasing its internal entropy. And we know that for it to continue to exist, to be organized, then it must increase the entropy of its surroundings rather than inside the cell. So that's that led me to just start formulating things from what are called reaction, diffusion dynamics, youth stuff, coming in, you know, work that gets done and stuff goes out.So when I set the problem up that way, I looked at it and I said, this is going to be really boring if the rate at which stuff moves has the same temperature, sensitivity is which work is getting done. So the very first thing I did was before I even started playing with the math was said, well, is that really a correct assumption or not? So it was a question I asked, because I'm looking at the math, but it was a question that didn't have already answer. So I literally had to do a literature review of basically how temperature sensitive either like diffusion or transport type processes were, and then compare those to what I call product formation.So hands-on takes a molecule and does something with it, produces a product, usually heat. And so the question is how temperature sensitive is the product formation relative to moving things? So when I did alert your review, I found that in fact, the product formation is somewhere around two to three times as sensitive as movements. So that means diffusion, if you increase temperature, it might double whereas product formation increased by like a factor of four six. So if I put those differential temperature sensitivities into my reaction diffusion framework, so now that I'm accounting for, as I increased temperature, how am I affecting the process of moving into and out of the cell, as opposed to the amount of work that gets done, then all of a sudden, all kinds of interesting things start happening.And in classical biochemistry, they don't really couple the movement, the things to the characteristics of doing work. The other thing is that most biochemists, when they study proteins, they study proteins in a test too. They don't actually study what they do inside the cell because it's really, really hard to do. And in fact, people who work like I, a colleague of mine at Syracuse who specializes in studying and finding ways to see really ridiculously hard things that cells do, that is the cutting edge is how do I see this stuff going on?But when they study the movements of enzymes in the cell, they find that there's all kinds of strange things going on. So people have discovered, for example, that cells are really more like they're not liquid inside, more like a gel. And so all of this means that everything that we kind of know about biochemistry in a test tube, it's not that what we've learned is useless, but there's just more things that are affecting how the biochemistry proceeds. So even in the simple reaction to fusion framework, which is way, way, way too simple for actual description of what's going on in the cell, then you get this problem that as you heat up the system, it can't dissipate products and heat fast enough to keep up with the rate at which he is being generated inside the cell.And so you can recast that problem as one of entropy. So what's happening to entropy inside the cell and what's happening to entrophy the outside. So when I did the calculations, it turns out that under a wide range of conditions that apply to real cells and real biochemical reactions, it's certainly possible that the biochemical reactions in itself could be limited by the ability to increase entropy outside the cell. So it's a rate at which that happens, which is called entropy production, which is kind of a misnomer or people will call it like flows of entropy.And there's all kinds of weird stuff that people use to describe it, which is not really accurate. What you're talking about is moving heat and materials. That's what flows, the processes increase entropy outside, inside. So that's what led to the whole formulation of a temperature dependent theory that says, when you get hot, you hit this limit and it's possible that you might hit this limit before you get to the point at which enzymes fall apart, which is the other half of temperature biochemistry studies, which has always been that when reaction starts slowing down, when it gets hot, that it must be because the enzyme is somehow coming apart or not being as effective at what it's supposed to do, but you can actually recapitulate what you actually get in an experiment from having limits to entropy production, without having assuming anything about the inside changing.And a lot of experiments have actually showed that as you increase the temperature, enzymes will maintain their structure and still maintain their affinity. But the reaction still slow down. And again, this is theory and there's lots of experiments that need to be done really to test this out. And I'm arguing that the reaction is slowing down because you can't move the products away from your reaction site. And so another part of thermodynamics says that all reactions are forward and reverse. So if a product sits around, then it starts to drive the reverse reactions.The net forward reaction slows down because there's too much reversal of a reaction. And so basically we're arguing that as you increase temperature, you get this increased reversal in the reaction. So one of the interesting things that came out of this is that there was this group and I'm not going to be able to remember their names right now, but there's a group in Europe that studying sulfide, reducing bacteria in the sediments, somewhere off the European coast. And they found almost inexplicably that as they increase the temperature, the sulfide, one of the key steps in the sulfur reduction pathway, the reverse of that reaction started overcoming the forward reaction.And they couldn't understand why that would be. And so they reached out to me and said, well, do you think that your model might explain that? So I gave her about a one paragraph description about how it would, so then they've done some subsequent work that suggest the same thing has happened. One tiny experimental system for this mysterious result that can't really be easily explained in biochemistry. There's others. So I talked about in my talk about the fact that there's these hot mitochondria. So mitochondria are being like, if you actually use the indirect measurements of what their temperature is, it suggests they're 52 degrees C while the surrounding cytoplasm is at 35 and people are like that can't be, but interestingly, it's something that lines up pretty closely with what would be predicted by these reaction, diffusion, thermodynamics and limitation by entropy production.So where does that take us? Well, mostly it just presents an alternative. It's like, okay, we've got this. It's like a standard model. That's been around 50 years and everyone just assumes that's the way it works, because nobody got a really conceive of a mechanism by which that wouldn't be way. So now I'm presenting an alternative that says, well, maybe in some cases it works in a different way. And if it does, then certain things will be true that you can't really predict from the standard model. And so let's go out and see whether these things are really true.So that can take on the form of sort of like the way astronomers work. You have a theory. The theory predicts that you should see or detect certain things or a magnitude of something. So it's called the classic hypothetical deductive method. You have a mechanism that says these things should happen, but you can't really measure those things for whatever reason astronomy is, because this stuff is too far away and you can't do experiments. So then you come up with a logical prediction that seems to be unique to that mechanism and say, okay, well that I can observe.So do I observe it or not? So we can apply that same method in this biochemistry context? No, literally put those ideas out there and stack them up against data. I mean, I don't want to get too far digressing about what, like dark, but I would like to mention that ecologists and biologists in general don't think that way. They don't think if I have a theory and should make a prediction and I should stack that up with what I should put it out there and say, okay, do the data support it, do they not? And this was a big issue in ecology in terms of trying to figure out what's organizing communities when we had the advent of what was called neutral theory.So the neutral theory basically said, it doesn't really matter what species are really liked. Doesn't matter what traits they have. Everything is just kind of this random (?) playing out. And then there's individuals moving in and out at random. So whatever I see is just the process that, and so when they started, they would say, okay, well, we can make predictions about what a community should look like. So how many individuals or what's the frequency of species that have different sizes of populations. What’s the place they started with?But it turns out that they didn't have independent measurements of all of the parameters in their model. So they allowed those to be fit, figuring, well, if the parameter can be fit, then that's probably good evidence that the model work well. Yes and no, it might be true, but a lot of times you can get totally different mathematical constructs. You can basically produce the same curve if you just put different numbers in. And since we didn't know what they were. So, for me, challenge comes from physics, which has a long history of doing this.Let's pretend that we actually can come up with decent hypothesis and these can be quantitative and described mathematically, and let's put out what that quantitative prediction should be that we would expect if we're correct and put it up against the data. And if we're wrong, that doesn't mean that the theory, I mean, it could mean that the theory is bad or it could mean that we didn't have good data or it could mean that we're missing some really key components that we haven't thought about. This is really, really true in ecology because we all know that there's lots and lots of factors that could be affecting things.And so some people just assume that that's always the case and that we can never know why anything happens. We should just study what's out there. So coming back full circle to the temperature biochemistry, it just seems to me that we kind of need to open the field up. And this reaction diffusion thermodynamics, isn't the only alternative that's been come up with. There's other people pointing out that there are changes in the heat capacity of enzymes that occur, which is also an entropy consequence.So basically as you heat up the number of different states, the enzymes can take on what, especially once they actually bind with the molecule so that we have your enzyme substrate complex, as it's called, then the number of different states that can take on is a lot less than what the enzyme could do before it binds up. And so that causes a drop in the heat capacity of the enzyme, which then causes their reaction to slow down as you get hotter. So that's like a totally alternative thing, but it's still kind of based on thermodynamics.So that also makes predictions that are different from the reaction to fusion models, but they're also different from the standard enzymes degrading theory. So to me, the rich or science is where we really take these new ideas and get out there and make predictions and see what the nature's actually doing, or do experiments to change certain things and see if the system responds one way or the other way, depending on what the predictions are. So I'm a long way from saying, oh, this is the theory that now explains all of the mistakes the biologist made for all these decades far from it.It's more of, we need to be more creative in the way that we take what we know and think about how systems work. And maybe it's a little more complex than enzymes falling apart because they're getting worn. But that doesn't mean that it's so complicated that we can't understand it or predict it.Michael Garfield (28m 30s): Well. Yeah. Okay. So once again, like so much I would like to address there, but for the sake of expedient narrative tour guiding through this, I feel like maybe the right link to cast in here is on the importance of first principles and ecological theory development. You were an author on this paper with a bunch of SFI people, Jen Dunne, Pablo Marquet, Geoff West, John Harte, and others. And you also study fractals and spatial scale.And so I'm curious, it doesn't seem like a huge leap from the implications of this particular work to the rhymes it makes with some of the troubling consequences of specifically like scaling laws as they apply to cities. And when people are using these mechanical metaphors to talk about what's going on inside a cell as little factories in this kind of thing, it's honestly hard not to try and analogize to, you know, macro economic flows and like the way that for instance, as a city speeds up, as it gets bigger, you know, this is all for folks that are not familiar with this.This is all stuff that we covered in episodes, 35 and 36 with Geoffrey West. And I highly recommend going back to that because his point has to do with the fractal structure of the social and infrastructural networks in a city leading to an acceleration of urban life as it scales and an acceleration of the products created by the activity of people in these societies. But then you get into supply chain issues. You get into these issues of like, how do you actually export all of this surplus productivity and looking at the way that my millennial friends are quite fond of sharing charts that show productivity in the workplace quadrupling over the last 40 years with wage stagnation. I wonder if, like just to cast one more piece to this when we had Brian Arthur on the show and he was talking about the way that economic networks scale and that at some point it looked to him like we were going to start needing active circulatory layers in the system to redistribute wealth. He was kind of calling for in his McKinsey 2017 essay, he was calling for a complex systems argument for universal basic income. Like you need a heart pumping blood once the organism gets above a certain size and what you see in those cases, compare it to like an anthill that gets above a certain size and then suddenly it's too productive and it actually needs to like more and more of the ants need to take more paid time off, basically. I wonder if we're not living through a kind of regime change like you show in this work where there was such a thing as just like more and more productivity and it could all be exported. And then we're in that middle regime maybe now where the rate of diffusion matters, that's the limiting factor. And then after that, there's just too much going on and you're actually doing the world a favor if you stop, like if you don't launch another podcast, for instance, like for the love of all.Mark Ritchie (31m 53s): Another information stream.Michael Garfield (31m 55s): Right, right. But at some point our entropy production is just too great. And we switch over into a regime where like seemingly paradoxical laws kick into dominance.Mark Ritchie (32m 6s): Well, I it's really interesting you brought that up because it really does kind of bring home what I've been working on with Chris Kempes as part of my SFI sabbatical. He's probably frustrated with me because I've spent the last three months dealing with an explosion in the space of grazing and soil carbon and greenhouse gas reductions, which I'll talk about later if we have time. But before that happened in January, he and I were working and had been working for some time.And mostly it's been taking a long time to do it. We're having to dig up obscure physics that people were working on various little separate contexts, but it deals that exact problem set that we're looking at what happens inside the cell, basically taking your city now and reconstructing. So we have this problem in the cell that we're doing work. And if we can't get our products out, that causes reactions to reverse. And so the actual rate of work slows down. So what it means is that cell can't just be full of enzymes because if the enzymes in the middle that they make a product that has nowhere to go, because there's no empty space for it to be able to move in and out of the cell.And so we have this fundamental problem of the cell, the more work it does, presumably the more divisions it makes or whatever. So you can imagine that cells that do lots of work would be favored by natural selection, but at the same time, it can be full because it needs to have space for stuff to move through. So the problem we were looking at was how much space is really required. And so we then get down into issues about like, if something is moving through a fractal, like distribution of obstructions, what actually determines the likelihood that we'll leave or the rate at which something will leave from some mean position in the middle of the cell.So in the end, we ended up combining some of the work that I done thinking about fractal distributions and fractal objects, and the ways of describing those with work that Chris had been doing with how many ribosomes were in a cell. And so like, how much should we say machinery is in the cell that's doing work. So we have succeeded in solving the problem, but only with numerical simulations at this point. So we're still looking for a more analytical solution, which I think is out there.I just haven't had time to get to it. And Chris has also worked on it. But fundamentally what we then discovered was that these kinds of first principles would generate something that had been sort of out there, but unexplained. So when people started measuring metabolic rates of single cell organisms, all the way down to the smallest bacteria, what they found was that instead of like what Geoffrey West found, especially mostly for vertebrae data, was that metabolic rate tends to increase with mass to the 0.7, five or three quarters power.So these original science paper that in 1997 and all the subsequent work has been about trying to understand why that exponent is three quarters as opposed to two thirds or something else. But when people looked at bacteria, they found that that relationship curved. So nobody really understood why it curved and nobody understood why it was so steep. So that even at the smallest sizes, you were actually scaling with an exponent greater than one. So this is called super linear scaling. And so it turns out that exactly what you were describing, when you start off small enough, you don't have a problem of diffusing your products.Like the very smallest cells are barely big enough to hold some of the more standard enzymes that are used in tablets. So once they produce a product, it takes almost no time at all for that to be able to leave the cell. But as the cell gets bigger and bigger and bigger, if the enzymes are uniformly or randomly distributed throughout cell, then you end up with this dead zone in the middle where stuff can't get out. So then that means that you're going to favor cells that are full of enzymes. They're going to have a lot of empty space in there because then each one of those enzymes that is remaining can sort of act in its full capacity and you can do more total work.And so it turns out that the scaling of those things then gives you this super linear scaling at the smaller sizes because as you add size, you sort of like double or triple the number of enzymes that you can have as you expand in the scale, because the enzymes are discrete thing. So it's kind of like if I have a trash can and I have cubes of a certain size, they don't just automatically all perfectly fill up with a circular trashcan. You're going to have some empty spaces and stuff, but the bigger, the trash can, the more likely you are to be able to more tightened, pack those in.So that's what generates a super linear scaling. Then it just starts to bend around as you get to this point. And it turns out interestingly to be that that point at which it starts to bend around and become the exponent less than one is about the point at which you have the largest bacteria kind of reach the general upper limit. There are a few exceptions which are kind of interesting, but you switch over to eukaryotes at that point. And so eukaryotes there's like four or five different major theories about how and why they evolved to be the way they are, but they compartmentalize.So they basically then creates these specialized organelles that do certain jobs. And they also have a lot of their enzymes on structures that are themselves fractal-like. People have actually measured the fractal dimension of these things in they're definitely not just uniformly distributed throughout the cell. So why compartmentalize? What's the advantage of doing that? The ultimate thing that happened was as you get bigger and bigger and bigger, then the exponent just settles down right to three quarters.But the interesting thing is, is that we haven't made any assumptions about like a vascular network or any of those kinds of scaling arguments. It strictly comes out of the fact that you're optimizing the amount of work that the cell can do, given that it has to move stuff in and out. And so it's just about how much empty space. It doesn't really say anything about the particular configuration space. Other than that, we're assuming that the particles are moving according to a random walk as they bounce around inside the cell. So we're really close to having a paper finished that pulls all these concepts together.That includes thermodynamics, which goes back to the issue that the reactions reverse if you can't dissipate products and the idea of organization and the trade-off between needing to move stuff and do work. And so it would extend almost beautifully because the curve, it is one of the interesting things is if you just put in all the standard thermodynamic parameters and diffusion coefficients and stuff like that, people have measured for cell, just take an average and you've plugged those right into the math. Then you get a curve that sits right through the data points.You don't have to fit it. So basically it provides an alternative explanation for what's happening at single cells that don't have organized or pressurized vascular systems, but that seamlessly merges into the theory of Western all in which you do have pressurized vascular systems. And so then it asks these really cool questions. Like why are you forced to use pressurized vascular systems when you get up to about a mass of about a grant and there are organisms that use them and even smaller sizes, but that sort of seems to be the limit of which you hit that.Why do you carry out its compartmentalize things or the other way of saying it is, how is it that bacteria are still around given that they can only get up to a certain size? And it also begs the question of, so is that what viruses problem is? Is that because they're so small, they can't fit enough enzymes. So they have to borrow somebody else's space in order to do the work so that they really are the ultimate parasite, which I guess that's everyone sort of thinks is a virus that way. But basically what we're arguing is that there's a physical explanation for why that happens at a certain site.So that's some cutting edge stuff that we're doing, and it's really, really cool. And it kind of does synthesize a lot of the work that both of us we've been doing over the past decade or so.Michael Garfield (40m 19s): Thank you for listening.

62,Episode Details / Transcript Mark Ritchie (0s): As we change temperature, it's not about how that's affecting production and that's part of the issue. But the other part of the issue is how are we changing the nutritional content of our plants and how can we get around doing that? And so what can we even do about? And because we're talking about these fundamental physical properties, it may not be something that you can get around with genetics. We'll just bioengineer a plant that can grow at hot temperatures, but it's also a high quality. Well, the genetics are happening in this physical context. And so those thermodynamics are sort of irrevocable, then genetics isn't going to permanently solve the problem. Michael Garfield (1m 1s): Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield and every other week we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks, to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week, we conclude our two-part discussion with ecologist, Mark Ritchie of Syracuse University on how he and his SFI collaborators are starting to rethink the intersections of thermodynamics and biology to better fit our scientific models to the patterns we observe in nature. Most of what we know about the enzymatic processes of plant and animal metabolisms comes from test tube experiments, not studies in the context of a living organism. What changes when we zoom out and think about life's manufacturing and distribution in situ. Starting where we left off in episode 62, we tore the implications of Mark's biochemistry research and ask what can studying the metabolism of cells tell us about economics. How does a better model of photosynthesis change the way we think about climate change and the future of agriculture? Why might a pattern in the failure of plant enzymes help biologists define where to direct the search for life in space? A better theory of the physics of bio-molecules and the networks in which they're embedded provides a clearer understanding of the limits for all living systems and how those limits shape effective strategies for navigating our complex world.

And so we have this fundamental problem of the cell, the more work it does, presumably the more divisions it makes or whatever. So you can imagine that cells that do lots of work would be favored by natural selection, but at the same time, it can be full because it needs to have space for stuff to move through. So the problem we were looking at was how much space is really required. And so we then get down into issues about like, if something is moving through a fractal-like distribution of obstructions, what actually determines the likelihood that it will leave or the rate at which something will leave from some mean position in the middle of the cell. So in the end, we ended up combining some of the work that I'd done thinking about fractal distributions and fractal objects and the ways of describing those with work that Chris had been doing with how many ribosomes were in a cell. And so like, how much should we say machinery is in the cell, that's doing work. So we have succeeded in solving the problem, but only with numerical simulations at this point. So we're still looking for a more analytical solution, which I think is out there. I just haven't had time to get to it. And Chris has also worked on it. But fundamentally what we then discovered was that these kinds of first principles would generate something that had been sort of out there, but unexplained. So when people started measuring metabolic rates of single cell organisms, all the way down to the smallest bacteria, what they found was that instead of like what Geoffrey West found, especially mostly for vertebrae data, was that metabolic rate tends to increase with mass to the 0.7, five or three quarters power. So the original science paper that in 1997 and all the subsequent work has been about trying to understand why that exponent is three quarters as opposed to two thirds or something else. But when people looked at bacteria, they found that that relationship curved. So nobody really understood why it curved and nobody understood why it was so steep. So that even at the smallest sizes, you were actually scaling with an exponent greater than one. So this is called super linear scaling. And so it turns out that exactly what you were describing. When you start off small enough, you don't have a problem of diffusing your products. Like the very smallest cells are barely big enough to hold some of the more standard enzymes that are used in tablets. So once they produce a product, it takes almost no time at all for that to be able to leave the cell. But as the cell gets bigger and bigger and bigger, if the enzymes are uniformly or randomly distributed throughout the cell, then you end up with this dead zone in the middle where it stuff can't get out. So then that means that you're going to favor cells that aren’t full of enzymes.  They are going to have a lot of empty space in there because then each one of those enzymes that is remaining can sort of act in its full capacity and you can do more total work. And so it turns out that the scaling of those things then gives you the super linear scaling of the smaller sizes because as you add size, you sort of like double or triple the number of enzymes that you can have as you expand in the scale, because the enzymes are discrete thing. So it's kind of like if I have a trash can and I have cubes of a certain size, they don't just automatically all perfectly fill up with a circular trashcan. You're going to have some empty spaces and stuff, but the bigger the trash can, the more likely you are to be able to more tightenly pack those in. So that's what generates a super linear scaling. Then it just starts to bend around as you get to this point. And it turns out interestingly to be that point at which it starts to bend around and become the exponent less than one is about the point at which you have the largest bacteria kind of reach the general upper limit. There are a few exceptions which are kind of interesting, but you switch over to eukaryotes at that point. And so eukaryotes and there's like four or five different major theories about how and why they evolved to be the way they are, but they compartmentalize. So they basically then creates these specialized organelles that do certain jobs. And they also have a lot of their enzymes on structures that are themselves fractal-like and people have actually measured the fractal dimension of these things in they're definitely not just uniformly distributed throughout the cell. So why compartmentalize? What's the advantage of doing that? The ultimate thing that happened was as you get bigger and bigger and bigger, then the exponent just settles down right to three quarters. But the interesting thing is that we haven't made any assumptions about like a vascular network or any of those kinds of scaling arguments. It strictly comes out of the fact that you're optimizing the amount of work that the cell can do, given that it has to move stuff in and out. And so it's just about how much empty space. It doesn't really say anything about the particular configuration of the space. Other than that, we're assuming that the particles are moving according to a random walk as they bounce around inside the cell. So we're really close to having a paper finished that pulls all these concepts together. That includes thermodynamics, which goes back to the issue that the reactions reverse, if you can't dissipate products and the idea of fractal organization and the trade-off between needing to move stuff and do work. And so it would extend almost beautifully cause the curve that is one of the interesting things is if you just put in all the standard thermodynamic parameters and diffusion coefficients and stuff like that, that people have measured for cell, just take an average and you've plugged those right into the math. Then you get a curve that sits right through the data points. You don't have to fit it. So basically it provides an alternative explanation for what's happening at single cells that don't have organized or pressurized vascular systems, but that seamlessly merges into the theory of [complex organisms] in which you do have pressurized vascular systems. And so then it asks these really cool questions like why are you forced to use pressurized vascular systems when you get up to about a mass of about a grant and there are organisms that use them and even smaller sizes, but that sort of seems to be the limit of which you hit that. Why do eukaryotes compartmentalize things or the other way of saying it is?  How is it that bacteria are still around given that they can only get up to a certain size? And it also begs the question of, so is that what viruses problem is? Is that because they're so small, they can't fit enough enzymes. So they have to borrow somebody else's space in order to do the work so that they really are the ultimate parasite, which I guess that's everyone sort of thinks is a virus that way but basically what we're arguing is that there's a physical explanation for why that happens in a certain site. So that's some cutting edge stuff that we're doing and it's really, really cool and it kind of does synthesize a lot of the work that both of us we've been doing over the past decade or so.Michael Garfield (10m 4s): You would be then I think the right person to, to pose a question that I posed to Geoffrey West in episode 36 and which to which he kind of just threw up his hands because his work predicts that the ongoing acceleration of cities as the demographic shifts continues and the human population grows that you get into the accelerating innovation crisis cycles, where you're constantly creating the externalities that then come back to bite you and you have to solve your way out of the problem that was created by the unintended consequences of your last innovation. So he plots this on this sort of ever steepening stair-step into the finite time singularity where he's like, this is the point where we either come up with a new internet level innovation every six months or civilization collapses. Those are your options. But when I look at this and everybody in the tech world seems to be trying to innovate their way out of the crisis created by innovation at the sort of meta level. But to me, listening to you talk about, well, there's a natural, upper bound set by thermodynamics on the size of a bacterium. And, you know, and we talked about that with Chris in episode 17, how that kind of sets the stage for these transitions into complex cells and that you see a similar, not identical, but something like that is going on in the transition from single cell eukaryotes to multi-cellular complex life. And so it kind of suggests to me, first of all, that human population, when people talk about collapse, people think of it in very sort of binary terms. Like we're either going to solve all of these problems and we're taking this to the stars or it's the end of human civilization and possibly the biosphere, and there's no sensitivity here to like the sign wave that we might be on, or the fact that all of this is precipitating some kind of major evolutionary transition in the structure of human civilization, which work by David Wolpert and Tim Kohler and others at SFI, Hajime Shimao, et cetera, have looked at this kind of thing through history happening again and again and again, that, you know, population scales to a point that begs a new information architecture. And at any rate, I'm just curious if you feel like this work that you're doing with Chris offers a possibly predictive model for the bounds of the size of cities and of the pace, the upper limit for the pace of civilization and whether it's suggests not equilibria per se, but reliable, quantitative thresholds that we should shoot for or mind over the decades to come. Mark Ritchie  (13m 1s): Yeah. I mean, since we're speculating, but one of the things that the theory predicts is that in fact, the three quarters exponent, isn't like at least from the mechanism that we're looking at is that really some hard and fast geometric rule. The number you get is still a function of the thermodynamics. So it turns out that in fact, that exponent is actually decreasing slightly as you get bigger and bigger and bigger. And so you can actually calculate the point that like how big of a metabolic entity you can have to the point where you get where the thing is strictly surface to volume ratio. It's basically about heat dissipation complete. Well, it turns out the size of that is something like six times 10 to the eighth, bigger than the biggest dinosaur. Now you can say when you get that big, you have vascular system. So your model shouldn't even really work. But my point was, if you did create vascular systems so that you could increase the speed of movement and things, then that presumably means that you could have a metabolic entity that could be much, much bigger than that. So what that to me suggests is that if we think of the planet is like an organism that's like spread super thin. So we think about the atmosphere and the surface of the earth setting the upper and lower bounds as a geometric object. But if you think about it as an entity, as a metabolic entity or whatever, that, I don't think that there may be limits step, but those limits are probably set by the speed at which you can move materials with them. And it would also suggest that there's a certain amount of space that has to be allocated to that movement. If we're just thinking about all I'm thinking about is sustaining metabolic and like the work that people are doing. So you can think about it and money flows. That's essentially how the internet has provided the cheat code. Because as we discovered during COVID, we can sit in the same chair in the same spot day, day after day, and still function at some level. And why, because we can get somebody to bring food to our house. Point is that at some point we're still limited by the ability to get materials to our own bodies, but we're able to multiply that same material into like 15, 5500 times much economic activity, because we can use essentially the information flows of the internet. I mean, we've known since the seventies, Paul Ehrlich's population bomb and all of the massive amount of work that's been done by NGOs across the developing world that may have a thermodynamics problem of how much solar energy can be converted into metabolically useful energy, because there's all those inefficiencies that we’d have to deal. So a lot of people focus on how much agricultural land can we even have, and is there a way to increase the efficiency of the land you're using? So there's that issue, but then the other issue is distribution. So if you ever fly, I don't know, most people forgotten flying somebody on a call today who was at an airport. He's like, wow, I forgot what an airport even sounded like. But anyway, but if you ever fly over one of those so-called mega cities, things that are like 20 million people, what you see is that there's part of the city is connected by fast moving hubs, allows really rapid movement of materials at well over the speed that's required to deliver it and support metabolic activity of humans. But a large fraction of those cities are we would call them like shantytowns or they have various names. But basically if you look at those, you can't even see how people move in and out of them, it's just basically like a solid wall and roofs, which is almost analogous to the cells that Chris and I were imagining of just being full of things that do work, but there's no way for them to get their products out. So you look at those and those are like massive centers of poverty. And they're self-organized because nobody came in and said, okay, you put your shack here or your house there. They just sort of built in a self-organized way. But because the flow of materials and stuff is so low because of the word nature of them, then you don't have to sustain such a rapid movement of things because the activity is low, but then you can't accelerate that because it doesn't have the capacity to deal with a greater amount of economic activity. And so to the extent that you get positive feedbacks in these things, so the roads are so narrow that you can literally touch doorways with your arms, to having four lane freeways moving in and out of the city center or mass transit things that move rapidly in and out. So you have the two alternate feedback. So then you build up this inequity of the ability to sustain metabolic activity. So if people say, well, we want to develop alternative livelihoods and markets and stuff in these poor areas. It's really hard to do because you can't, I mean, I don't know about the math, I'm just speculating here, but you just simply can't move things in and out of those systems as rapidly as you can other places. And so it might behoove from a very, very, very high up level about this whole issue about distribution networks and the inequity in those networks maybe the thing that's actually limiting our ability to produce things as humans, not because we've designed it that way on purpose, because most of these things are self-organize. So for me, the question is that if you just let people self-organize on what they're doing, then the amount of economic activity that they're engaged in will end up producing feedbacks that lead to these big discrepancies. And then you have this ever-growing larger portion of the population that can't participate in the rapid economy. And then you have this huge disparity in revenues and income and so on. So it kind of goes back to the points that you were making that is our limit, some physical limit, like in terms of we can design the world and then ideal fashion, could we be doing more than what we're doing? I'm pretty sure we could, but letting local self-organization principles that are operating under different constraints play out, then produces these discrepancies in the ability of things to move in and out of human systems. So that ultimately on a per capita basis puts a limit on our productivity. So I don't know, I'm trying to play along here and extending the things that we're learning about what's going on inside a cell, to the work that people have been doing with how cities are organized. And I'm probably trampling on top of people's sites. If you don't know what the hell you're talking about, because we all know that X, Y, and Z. So I, you know, I get it, but I'm just saying that I'm not sure that people often think that things like the internet and communication networks are still somehow ultimately constrained by material networks. And we still have to get raw materials to build houses, to eat, to drink. And people point out that one of the biggest environmental problems, aside from the global warming issue, as things like fresh water or access to health care, all of those things are related to physical networks like healthcare. I can tell you better things to do over Zoom, but ultimately there's really no substitute from having healthcare professional and person meet face to face. You just can't ever really truly get around that. So you still have to be able to move people around and people have to have access to things. And I know people who if the only place I could go to find a doctor is to go downtown New York City. I would never see a doctor because I just don't. I'd rather die than have to deal with that environment because it's just like they can't mentally process it. Whereas people from New York City, if I have to go sit in a log cabin for three months until the pandemic is over, that would probably have equal mental stress and strength. So if a connection it's probably due to what leads to the inequity in these distribution networks. And to what extent does that inequity put a constraint on the behavior of the whole system. So you can have all the innovations you want, but if they only apply to an increasingly smaller and smaller proportion of the population, eventually there's a tipping point at which the larger proportion of the people are not being supplied with materials, goods, and services they need, which you can really ultimately think of is like an unacceptable level of entropy in the system. So then it just kind of collapsed because it can't stay organized. Michael Garfield (21m 24s): Well, a couple things there. One is New York City. Have I ever been anywhere where the challenges of diffusion transport across the membrane of a city are not more obvious. The amount of effort it takes to get out of New York when you're in it is unbelievable. And to that point that you were making about slums and shantytowns and so on. When we had Luis Bettencourt on the show, back in episode four, he was talking about exactly this thing. You stage an intervention by using network models, to identify where in a slum streets should go for better transport of materials and people and so on. But you're right. It is an interesting analogy to chew on that people tend to think in terms of the sort of ideal of what is possible given top-down technocratic management, but that always bumps up against precisely the kind of hidden limits and constraints that you're identifying in this paper.  I think about that in terms of this is not just about how do we properly refrigerate our server firms so that we can continue to grow the surface area of the planet for better dissipation in our computations. But there's this other piece that you spoke to. And I think that this is where it really comes back down to earth in this conversation. In your talk you spoke about how the decline in the availability of elements with increasing temperatures reduces trophic transfers and ecosystems. It gets to this point of like, well, you might have the best idea in the world, but if you can't recruit the resources required to execute it, it's never going to happen. And I would love to hear you speak to this piece of it in particular, because this is sort of where the buck stops in terms of the implications of this application of thermodynamics to biochemistry. You say the nutrient density of crops is declining with global warming. So we can't just make this place hotter and hotter and somehow still apply a perfect solution to it because the material substrate upon which those decisions depend is falling out from under us. And I'd love to hear you speak to these two curves. Mark Ritchie  (23m 37s): This is something that we study in trophic interactions and ecological systems. So we have one place where you have this high amount of rainfall, massive amounts of productivity, and relatively little of that productivity ever gets consumed by another animal. So most tropical rain forest, while they’re massively good at decomposing dead materials, most of the productivity that's produced in them is never consumed. It just dies and then decomposes. So how do I compare a system like that that's massively productive. But if I actually look at how many things in sort of the total mass of things that are being supported by that productivity, it's much lower than if I go to let's say a grassland like Serengeti or the Great Plains in North America, where historically, or even still currently the animals that are in an equilibrium with the resource that at least according to the numbers are eating anywhere from 40 to 70% of what's produced. So the question is why and how do we get these differences? Well, the differences are driven by what is the nutrient content of the plants. And so then the question is, we have environmental factors that are controlling nutrient content, as well as environmental factors that are controlling the total amount of production. So any crop agricultural system is faced with that same dilemma in the sense that I can grow massive amounts of sugar cane, huge biomasses that far exceed the production of corn or anything like that, huge biomasses. But most of what's produced is inevitable to people. Whereas you can get these huge densities of animals and Serengeti living on something that only grows this tall and their differences, the nutrient content. So an agricultural systems and agricultural research organizations and universities and programs have for years been focused on production, like how much crop can you produce? And not that much work has really focused on the idea that well, as environments change or across different kinds of soils and rainfall and that kind of thing, then how has that actually changing the nutritional content? And I think mostly that's because nobody has ever, and especially with temperature, nobody ever really put the idea together that if I changed the temperature that the optimal nutrient content for the plant to grow at those higher temperatures is actually lower than would be if it was cooler. That's just a hypothesis. It doesn't really have a current physiological explanation, even though people have started to notice the patterns. And so the reaction diffusion thermodynamics would predict that that should happen. And the reason is, is because as it gets hotter and you have this bigger problem of trying to dissipate heat and products, then each enzyme can much, or as much more likely to be able to produce as much product as you can handle without having the internal entropy of the system increased too much. So therefore I don't need as many enzymes, I don't need as high a concentration of enzymes. And since much of the nutrition in a plant comes from things like chlorophyll and other proteins and stuff, they're all related to the amount of work that plant leaf can do. Then that means that those plant leaves and to some extent, by proxy to things like seeds. So if you're talking about corn or you're talking about wheat rice, then there's essentially less nutrients in the plant to be able to put into those crops. So that's the connection between the biochemistry and crop thing.  Again, there's a whole button where people would be screaming at me like, well, there's a whole bunch of leaps you just made there that you don't really have good experimental evidence one way or the other for that because nobody's bothered to look or if they had, it was just as one of the steps and they didn't see how they all fit together. So I think the thing that we have to realize for me, that's the main thing. It's just thinking that as we change temperature, it's not about how that's affecting production and that's part of the issue. But the other part of the issue is how are we changing the nutritional content of our plants and how can we get around doing that? And so what can we even do about that? And because we're talking about these fundamental physical properties, it may not be something that you can get around with genetics. I mean, that's the thing is everybody's, we'll just bioengineer a plant that can grow at hot temperatures, but it's also a high quality. Well, if that causes the plant to suffer from it dynamically, for reasons that have nothing to do with the particular genetic, I mean, the genetics are happening in this physical context. And so those thermal dynamics are sort of irrevocable, then genetics isn't going to permanently solve the problem because you're going to have plants that don't do that, that ended up doing better than the plants are doing. So it's just something that we have to keep in mind and to recognize that by the same token, cold temperate areas that never used to be able to grow crops because of the growing seasons are too short, maybe come are prime agricultural areas now because they're still cool enough to raise high quality plants. And now they're warm enough to have a long enough season that you can actually produce a crop. The downside is most of those areas because they had short growing seasons they often hold high carbon stocks because they have these seasons of productivity. There's carbon that goes in the ground. But because it's so cold, most of the year microbes don't break down the organic matter. So the organic matter builds up year after year after year after year. So you get these areas with really high carbon stock. So now I'm going to convert those into farm fields. Then all of that carbon that was stored, there just goes right to the atmosphere. So it's kind of like, there's like all these multiple unintended consequences that you have. So that's what makes ecology so fun and also so frustrating because policy people say, well, just tell me what solution I can use. Like, well, you need to try out like 15 different things and see which one actually works because there's too many variables for us to tell you the one right now. That's just some of my thoughts about it. But in terms of like engineering, how we deal with global warming, we need to be prepared. I think that there may be some fiscal inevitability that are built into the fundamental biochemistry of photosynthesis and the way that organisms do work that might cause us to have to rethink how we're going to respond to that. That's like, can we expand the corn growing region far enough northward, fast enough to keep up with climate change or does cultural barriers to doing that, make it hard for someone in Canada, who's never been able to farm corn because of the growing season. Now you have to think about farming corn instead of wheat. Those are other social issues that influence how things change. But I think that we have to ask those kinds of big questions. They cross national boundaries. They make us think more in terms of like whole biomes and very, very large landscape ecosystem type questions, rather than thinking about it from a biotech point of view, which is, well, I just need to engineer the gene and the plant that will make it do what I want in this particular environment. Michael Garfield (30m 38s): I mean, that's not even mentioning how much more nuance you have here than the brute force. Let's just throw a bunch of calcium carbonate up in the atmosphere. And let's say, I had, I guess, a last comment on what you just said, it's funny how much deeper the discipline of ecology has become since we realized. And you know, a lot of historians peg the sort of advent of cybernetics to World War II, targeting computers, but also to the nuclear bomb and the recognition that fallout gets up into the jet stream and blows all over the world. And there is no outside anymore. Just to kind of tie a bow on this, I think your work is so fascinating in that if you propose as you kind of hinted at a moment ago that the earth is something approximating the upper bound of one of these surface area maximizing intelligent living systems, where does it export it's like where are we at some point the conceit that we can control everything bumps up against the real physical membranes that we're dealing with here, and one of the things I love about the conversation going on right now at SFI around what engineering and design look like in light of all of this is it's not some sort of omniscient control of the markets or of architecture, but a tango with this adaptive intelligence that lies all around us and is distributed through all these systems. And super glad that we got the opportunity to talk. And I would love to know what, if anything, have we not discussed today that is the cutting edge for you. Like where is your curiosity tugging you right now? Mark Ritchie  (32m 28s): So I guess we could start the argument that a lot of people have argued that basically beef is bad. So if we want to change the climate and we all have to stop eating beef or things that are produced on factory farms because of the inefficiency and because of the particular case of ruminant animals, the methane that's produced. And then there's also calculations people have made that people have suggested that in fact, beef is also produces a lot of nitric oxide, which if we convert it to the equivalent, CO2 is a major thing. So one of the things that goes back way in time in ecology has been this idea that we have kind of like this production in the absence of consumers. And then if we have consumers, they just sort of reduce that production down to some level, whether it's just a little bit like in the rainforest and talking about earlier a whole lot, like in any grasslands. So one of the big questions has been, is it possible to take the 40% of the Earth's land surface that's considered rangelands? So these are lands that are too dry for crops, generally speaking, or they're on incredibly poor soil. So they're too nutrient poor for crops. Even if we put in massive amounts of fertilizer, they often get too much rain and the nutrients just leach out of the soil. So you have these massive areas across the blood surface that really the only way as we know of it now for humans to gain functional calories and nutrients from those systems is to raise them with animals. So the question is, is the methane of those animals, is that the only thing that we need to worry about? Well, so one of the things that I've been working on in the last decade is this idea that when animals graze the system, they only have episodic effects, which then allow the system to recover. So from a very SFI point of view, we have the network of trophic exchanges that then is essentially disrupted by a heavy amount of, you know, so some parts of that network are massively disrupted, but only for a short period of time. And then the network has the opportunity to be resilient to that. And so long ago, Sam McNaughton working in the Serengeti when he was sitting there looking at it, he made measurements that suggested that when we have this kind of episodic grazing, it actually leads to higher production of the system because the whole ability of the system to gather, so say assimilate carbon dioxide, and through photosynthesis, you basically go through that same process. And the reason is because you're putting the system back into a place where the plants are no longer resource limited again. So the net thing is that, so when you have this episodical herbivory and you have this regrowth of grass that follows the herbivory, the total amount of photosynthesis over the whole of the season is higher, under grazing than it would be without. So there's been this huge moment in the agricultural field, and it has like a ton of different names. It's gone from rotational grazing. What I call it now as short duration identity, the idea that we get a bunch of animals, we keep them together. We move them around relatively rapidly. So they're never in one place very long, but they have a really strong impact when they're there, but then they're gone and there's all this time and plants to like resource to regrow. And so if you convince systems like this, that you can actually increase the amount of carbon that's assimilated by the system and therefore increase the amount of carbon that's in the soil. So in a few of the cases now that people have studied, and again from a lot of scientists are not really on board with this because it hasn't been done in controlled experiments, but we have lots and lots of little test cases that would suggest that when you implement this kind of, and it's actually a form of mimicking natural systems, because a lot of the natural systems are migratory, but we've lost that because we've encroached on all their space. So when we mimic the natural systems, which are engaged in this episodic trophic transfer, followed by resilience and recovery, then the amount of carbon being captured in the soil far exceeds the methane is produced by the animals that are doing work. So a while back, I formed this little company called Soils for the Future, which eventually sort of settled into being a consulting company where I basically would make some measurements and do some modeling exercises and do things. And we worked on this project in Northern Kenya, where we got local pastoralists to start having their animals mimic the movements of wildlife so they were much more migratory and never stayed in the same place for very long. So we've actually got that point to the thing where we can demonstrate that the improvement of practices is actually sequestered way more carbon in the soil than the methane that the animals are produced. And so now everyone is trying to figure out how they can apply that to their system. So my little company that used to just get a couple months of summer salary equivalent of income, because now the deluge by people that are interested in trying to see if they can do this, even to the point that the whole country of Uruguay, the government of Uruguay wants to basically turn their entire country into a grazing management carbon project. So the key to all of this new work that's been doing was there was a student named Jacob Penner at Syracuse who went to Yellowstone and he did this experiment where he clipped plants each plant exactly by 50%, most tedious thing I can ever possibly imagine. And then he measured the productivity of those things after the clipped. And he showed quite clearly that there was an increase in production that came from doing this 50% clippings. So he had brought in this one paper that had some math about it, and I was looking I'm like, well, this paper's like missing the whole thing about plants. They grow up bigger, biomass become much more resource limited. So how is it he changed that? And then when I did that, then all of a sudden how popped all of these outcomes that were measured 30 years before by Sam McNaughton and Serengeti, so I'm sitting there going, okay, and then I'm thinking what, ecologists, I've never really looked at trophic interactions in this way. They always just kind of assume that if there's something out there eating it, they're kind of always eating. So everything is kind of at a steady state and it's described by differential equations. So there's this rate of removal and a rate of production. And so everything is sort of always happening all at the same time. So when you change that up and so things become happening as episodes are in discrete time intervals, then the whole dynamics of the system change. And I'm sure there's like hundreds of people out there studying networks and how they respond to pulses of disturbance and all kinds of other things like this. But in really complex systems, it's really hard to study that except in like specific simulations where you're like, okay, I'm going to mimic a certain kind of network and I'm going to do stuff to it computation because you can't really study it with differential equations because you have to know the time dependent function of change. I did it analytically, but I used simplest possible functions you can possibly use. They're missing a lot of stuff we're not going would say, so we normally don't have any college time dependent functions or anything. So it's really hard to study how these episodes play out other than in simulations. So to me, the thing that we need to get together moving forward is thinking about this in a broader context, way beyond grazing and soil carbon, and thinking about how necessary is it that we accommodate the idea that we build networks, that they ultimately have to go through cycles where they get disturbed, and then they have to show some kind of resilience and that the total amount of work done by these networks systems is much greater when that actually happens then if we just assume that they're constantly at some sort of steady state. And I'm sure there's people that have studied this, and I just haven't had time to go look at the general literature, but to me that it's like a great potential connection between solving some real world problem of, should we eat beef is a way to eat beef in a way that's friendly to the climate, not to studying fundamental properties of networks and how much work they do and the necessity for resilient episodes for their function.  Michael Garfield (40m 23s): I mean, just to link it again, relentlessly to other SFI research, it sounds a lot like the work that Stephanie Crabtree and Jen Dunn did on the Martu and fire foraging and the way that some indigenous peoples actually create biodiversity rather than just hammering the same thing over and over and eroding the top soil and destroying the terrific networks. Anyway, Mark, this has been totally fabulous. I thought it was really interesting. We just shared an article, a press release on some of Chris campus's work with the NASA agnostic biosignatures lab, trying to use scaling laws and stoichiometry to figure out the elemental ratios where you might find life. And I was just like, oh God, I want to ask you based on these dynamics, the decline in certain kinds of elemental availability suggests that there are probably even further constraints on top of the ones that Chris and Simon Levin and others just posed like, should we be looking on colder worlds than we would have otherwise thought for life? Or like, how does this change the way that we think about the Goldilocks zone and that kind of stuff. Mark Ritchie  (41m 26s): Thermodynamics would definitely have something to say about that. And probably there's an interaction between the temperature and the element ratios, meaning that certain element ratios would allow you to function in cooler environments, potentially assuming that you overcame the issue of freezing water. So if you have a different solvent that doesn't freeze it in a certain thing, but there are those speculations about life that depend on different solvents, then that opens up a whole different world of different possible limiting elements and stoichiometry that then probably depending on how those different elements play in building catalyst.   I think if we're looking at life, we're always going to be looking at right along with whether you have a substrate that can generate energy. You've got to have catalysts of some kind, and we use organic chemicals mostly for those catalysts, except that at the core of them, there are certain elements like manganese, magnesium, copper, cobolt. So all of those so-called vitamins and minerals that we always have to take, most of those are metals that lie at the core of those enzymes. And you can show, for example, nitrogen fixing plants, and certain places actually been shown to the limited by molybdenum because that's the core metal that sits in the nitrogenous enzyme. So there are a lot of places they're not, but there are places where they have been shown to be limited by that So there are a lot of places they're not, but there are places where they have been shown to be limited by thatparticular element. So what I'm saying is that if we're thinking about work and life exists, we have to think about where do we have substrates? So we have to have electron donors and all that stuff, but we also have to have the catalytic bio molecules that can do that. And whether those things are like pure metals, like chemical companies use all the time, or whether there's some kind of organic metallic and what that metal is and what those properties would be. To me, that's just a huge universe for exploration possibilities because of the interaction with temperature. Michael Garfield (43m 17s): It just makes me think that the global economy is only going to get as big as we have enough cobalt and palladium. You know, like at what point do we start harvesting asteroids in order to keep making phones.Mark Ritchie  (43m 32s): Papers that argue that this, the search for phosphorous, that that's the thing that's ultimately going to limit our agricultural production. I've seen a couple of papers in the last couple of years about that. And especially one of my grad students just discovered by looking at data from Serengeti. And in fact it looks like the impact of the herbivores may be limited by phosphorus in the Serengeti, not by nitrogen, which is what everyone or sodium that everyone has always assumed or speculated on. And most people who studied terrestrial ecology, unless they work in really old soils, like in Australia or Africa, they don't really pay that much attention to phosphorus in natural systems. And so things that make bones are highly vulnerable to the total amount of phosphorus they can accumulate over our lifetime. So we don't have a problem with it because we've massively shifted phosphorus from these pools in the earth. You've mined it effectively and put it on our crops and our crops have taken it up. But at some point, if we run out of that kind of fertilizer, then again, we get back to this plant nutrition rather than production as being the issue that limits us. So yeah, even on our own planet, we're still trying to figure out what elements are really limiting life. Michael Garfield (44m 41s): So Florida sits on a huge phosphorus deposit. Mark Ritchie  (44m 44s): Well, I mean, eventually it'll be like fracking, except you're fracking for phosphorus because you'll find a technology that when phosphorus becomes sufficiently expensive, then it's worth doing that technique to mine it out Michael Garfield (44m 57s): For parts. We don't need it.Mark Ritchie  (44m 58s): Yeah. It's like phosphorus is kind of like oil was in the seventies were ruined, predicted that we run out of it, but then we never have, because we keep inventing new technologies that allow us to access different pools anyway. Yeah. This is super fun. Super fun. I'm so glad that you invited me to chat. Michael Garfield (45m 15s): Thanks for taking an extra long time with us. Way, way beyond the book tower. Mark Ritchie  (45m 20s): Yeah, you too. Michael Garfield (45m 22s): Thank you for listening.

63,Episode Details / Transcript Machine-generated transcript by podscribe.ai edited by Aaron Leventmann:Devin White (0s): I was able to model fairly successfully big chunks of this ancient trail system that I could actually see from space using satellites. But I would identify ancient trails. I would go out on the landscape, ground truth them, map them out, and then generate theoretical models based on these cost estimate equations and to see if they would line up. It was sort of the early days of the research, but there are these couple of areas where I was working with the archeologist on the range at the time, Adrienne Rankin, who just knows that place inside and out, she's been there a very long time and they kept pointing to this one area. This area doesn't make any sense. Like the trails just aren't doing anything likeI would remotely expect that people are trying to move efficiently. And she said, well, two things. One, you don't understand that landscape as well as the people who've been living there for a very long time. And granted that's a very good point. And she says, also, you maybe need to think a little bit differently about what they are valuing in terms of what are they trying to minimize as costs. I spend enough time out in this region to understand that that area was what archeologists would call a ritual landscape. That the goal moving around in that area was not about efficiently getting from point A to point B.It was about getting between these very important sacred places. And so it just a completely different kind of movement. So it got me thinking about how do you quantize that? How do you actually get that into a model where it's squishy or so to speak? It's not slope, it's not temperature. It's not time. It's the value of people are putting on reaching a place and that place matters. And it doesn't matter how much it costs you physically to get there. Sometimes making the journey more difficult is the pointMichael Garfield (1m 55s): 70,000 years ago, humans migrated on foot across the ancient continent of Sahul to landmass that has since split up into Australia and New Guinea. Mapping the journeys of these ancient voyagers is no small task previous efforts to understand prehistoric migrations relied on course estimates based on genomic studies were on spotty records of recovered artifacts. Now progress in the fields of geographic information system mapping and agent-based modeling can help archeologists run massive simulations that explore all likely paths across a landscape, bridging the view from orbit, with thoughtful models of prehistoric peoples and how they moved through space.The new research expands our scientific understanding of how ritual and story and code vital geographic features and sheds light on how our modern world is the product of deep ancient forces. Agent-based modeling and archeology can also help save lives by improving science communication, empowering stakeholders in cultural resource management and facilitating better international planning and coordination as the climate crisis looms.Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield. And every other week, we bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week we talk with Stefani Crabtree as a five fellow and assistant professor in socio environmental modelingMichael Garfield (3m 34s): At Utah State University and Devin White, R and D manager for autonomous sensing and perception at Sandia National Laboratories. Stefani and Devin are the first two authors on the recent nature human behavior paper “Landscape rules predict optimal superhighways for the first peopling of Sahul,” a project at the bleeding edge of agent-based modeling for archeology simulated over 125 billion potential ancient migratory routes.In our conversation, we discussed bringing advanced technologies to bear on research into human prehistory. The ways humans make sense of space, how our Mayans and landscapes inform each other, and the ways agent-based modeling might help avert disaster for the sedentary populations of our century.

Thank you for listening. Stefani Crabtree, Devin White. It is a pleasure to have you on complexity podcast.Stefani Crabtree (4m 53s): It's very nice to see you and hear you, Michael. Michael Garfield (4m 58s): It's been awhile. Stefani. I'm glad to meet you Devin. You two are the first two authors on this extraordinary nature human behavior article on the first peopling of Sahul of what we now think of as like Australia and the related islands. Before we get into that, I want to invite both of you to just give a bit of a background about yourselves as scientists and about the kind of work that brought you into this project, what animated you to become researchers and then like map the pathway from where you started as curious minds into your peopling of this project. Stefani Crabtree (5m 45s): So my person as a scientist, I did my PhDs at Washington State University and at Université de Franche-Comté. So I have two of them. And while I was doing my PhD in the U.S. my work focus predominantly on the U.S. Southwest and being a Southwestern researcher, it turns out this is one of those lovely places where all the researchers get along and get to know each other, which is a great place to be as an early PhD student.And I was at our society for American archeology conference, I believe in San Francisco, when I really connected with Dr. Devin White, who at that point was in DC. I believe this was before he moved to Oak Ridge National Labs and his PhD when he was at CU Boulder was looking at human migration within the Southwest, across some really inhospitable landscapes. And I was an agent-based modeler.That was predominantly what I did. It's kind of like Sim City for researchers where you imbue an individual with characteristics, and you have an environment that changes over time, and you look at what happens and Devin and I decided to meet in the lobby of the conference hotel. And I was late because I had just seen an archeologist get mugged outside of the conference hotel. And I run in, I'm super worried about meeting Devin and here's this person who I've never had like huge conversations with.And we're like, let's do something awesome together. And so that was really the beginning of our work together was could we figure out a way to bring my expertise in agent-based modeling and lots of people moving across the landscape with Devin's amazing expertise of building this from everywhere to everywhere model that people. His dissertation that really changed the field of how we think about human movement. And so this was many, many years ago before I finished my PhD and we kind of tabled that idea until I kind of settled somewhere and started a post-doc.And I guess we'll continue that conversation of how we decided on Sahul or Australia and Papa, New Guinea and Tasmania, and the surrounding areas until Devin kind of introduces himself. I'm now a researcher at the Santa Fe Institute and also an assistant professor of socio environmental modeling at the Quinney College of Natural Resources at Utah State University. Devin White (8m 24s): That's a tough act to follow. So, but like Stefani I'm with Southwest archeologists, by professional training, she made a lot of great points about why it's such a great laboratory for exploring complexity and prehistory and even new technologies for how to go about doing that. When I was in graduate school, my original focus was very traditional and on Southwest archeology, but there was a professor there named Payson Sheets who got some funding and had been working in Costa Rica for many years on understanding human movement down there, trying to identify ancient trail systems.But he did it in a very novel way, which was looking for these trail systems using remote sensing. So using satellite technologies that were becoming more available to archeologists at the time. And so everybody wanted to go do this. There was a lot of competition amongst the grad students to get in on that project because you get to spend a summer in Costa Rico. And it's kind of hard to beat that. Now, if anyone's ever done field work in Costa Rica, they'll tell you it's not as glamorous as it sounds, but it is a fantastic opportunity, but he had one requirement. And that was, you had to complete a series of courses within the aerospace engineering program at University of Colorado on remote sensing method and theory, image processing, geospatial technologies, all these really crazy important, very difficult things to do, especially if you're an archeologist and you're not trained in anything like that.And so several of us went in. Only a few of us survived, but we came out of it inspired and went off and did this work. And I felt like even though Costa Rica wasn’t my area, just trying to understand prehistoric network, how people would move through them, how that sort of shaped their experience, how that helps us understand the past. I could bring that to the Southwest. And so that's what I did for my dissertation was looking at this really inhospitable landscape in Southern Arizona that honestly looks a lot like environmentally parts of Australia that we looked at for the current study.So there's a lot of overlap there. Most archeologists are all guilty of this. It's just human nature. You tend to focus on smaller areas. And what I think we've seen, Stefani was a pioneer in these generally archeologists that are coming forward that do this now, when we look at larger and larger areas, you know, bigger expanses of space, bigger expanses of time to do that, you really do need to bring technology to bear on the problem. So starting with my dissertation, and then moving beyond that into my professional career, I kept bringing bigger and bigger computational tools to bear on this problem and had to invent a lot of new ways to do so in the process.What was interesting about our professional meetings, the one where Stefani and I met several years prior to that, I had a very similar encounter with another archeologist when I went to grad school with who had been watching what I had been doing for my dissertation and said, could we take this and apply it to this area of central Mexico to try to understand some really, really important aspects of pre-history down there. And that was really the birth of a new origin of the technology that you applied to this study was I had to take what I was doing for my dissertation and supersize it in this really crazy way. It really set the stage for where we ended up with this study it almost 10 years later.And so this has been a journey of many, many years, and I've managed through my professional career, which has not been in academia. I've worked in federal agencies in DC and worked at Oak Ridge national laboratory for about six years. And I've been at Sandia for three and a half. Now is this has been a constant theme, trying to understand human movement, patterns of migration. These days it's not my primary job. I actually run our autonomous sensing and perception organization here. So we focus on AI and machine learning object recognition for what we'll call high consequence systems, things where people make decisions based off of these systems that impact human lives.And so there's a huge trust factor in that in terms of making sure that these technologies are doing the right thing. And so Melanie Mitchell and I think would get along very, very well in that regard. So this is not my day job, but it's something I'm incredibly passionate about. And working with researchers like Stefani and the team from Australia, it keeps me engaged. And it's just been an absolute pleasure.Michael Garfield (12m 14s): Well, I definitely want to get back to trust issues because there is something about remote sensing and the necessity of satellite data that kind of rhymes with big science and in general, and the abstraction of the research process, and definitely ties into where I want to land this conversation much later in the use of agent-based models as a teaching tool and as a tool for a much more inclusive science and like getting people involved in this stuff.So there's kind of a Mobius strip here that I want to explore with the two of you around the way that you actually did this research and the way that it requires basically standing on the highest mountain you can, which is in space to get a perspective on navigating this research terrain, but then having to come back down off that mountain. Before we get into the weeds here, I think it would be useful to talk a little bit about the prior research that you referenced in this paper. How have people tried to understand archeological research on migratory patterns in the past? You enumerate a number of different approaches and the limits of these approache.And I think that that's the right place to stand here to sort of understand the coastline that you and your coauthors expanded with this project.Stefani Crabtree (13m 38s): So I think it's easiest to begin by talking about when you get a guidebook that tells you about hiking, maybe around Santa Fe or anywhere else, it'll have a trail rating system. And that trail rating system is actually based on how difficult it will be going up, going down, how long the truck is, what you need to carry, if you need to carry water, if there's water along the way. When I was an undergrad in Los Angeles, I was surprised to learn that a lot of trails have like water fountains along the way.It's just a thing. Those ways of ranking trails are kind of at the basis of what a lot of path models do in a geographic information systems kind of way. But a lot of these GIS approaches take into account your start point and your stop point and what does it take to get between those two? And that's how a lot of models archeological and non-archeological have started from a beginning point to an end point. How costly, how hard will it be?How much uphill, how much downhill, how much flat, what do you need to those kinds of things? And that's great because it can tell you a lot about how difficult it would be to walk from say, Chaco Canyon to the basin of Mexico, which we know people did. But if you don't know where that path is, it becomes more difficult because you have to give it more and more starting and end points. So we have one-to-one. So that's one path. Now we have two to ones. That's two paths. Well, two to two, that starts getting more and more complex.Now, 10 to 10, you start doing the math and it starts getting kind of intractable. And then there are a lot of other things that you need to take into account when you do different kinds of models. And so maybe it's not just walking and carrying water, but maybe you want to walk by a certain spot or you want to avoid a certain spot. And so these kinds of things get into the complexity of this. So when we did this analysis, we looked at the landscape of archeological path models and looked at how many paths, places these studies created.And they were in the tens or dozens. Sometimes if people really wanted to get things going, they were in the hundreds, but the more computational complexity you have, the better computer you need. And it becomes increasingly difficult, ends up out by necessity. A lot of these are pretty simple.Devin White (16m 17s): There's sort of this siren song when you think about doing path modeling and archeology. I mean, it seems simple. It looks like it could be easy to do. There are push button tools to do it more importantly, we carry this technology around with us everywhere we go on our phones. You know, if you use any kind of GPS based routing to get you from point A to point B, it's effectively the same technology underneath, but since you're running it on your phone, you think, oh, this has gotta be pretty lightweight. Like it can't be that complicated to do this, but almost no one really thinks about every day, including myself is really all the computing is happening in some big, massive data center somewhere.You just send your request in, and then you get the answer back and you think this is instantaneous, but there's like some massive computing machine in the background that does all of this work. And so it's easy to fall into that trap of thinking, well, I could quite efficiently apply this to some archeological problem. And then you start doing this and you, and you try to do it at a human scale. You know, you think about anything high resolution, like being able to think about our built environment and how much detail is required to reconstruct that in some digital form and how we would move through it. If you start working at a truly human scale, it can limit the size of the area that you can look at just because of access to resources and in your knowledge of that space.And so there's a constant negotiation there, the kind of environment you build and the trades against what you can reasonably try to accomplish with your access to the right kind of computing resources and your ability to bend them to your will. And one of the things I discovered very early on in my graduate career was those push button tools were limiting. You know, they're 80% solutions for a lot of things. You know, you just want a quick answer. You can push a bunch of buttons, throw some data in, you can get an answer out, but they're effectively black boxes. Thank goodness that there's a lot more open source technology out there than there used to be.You know, there's tools that archeologists can grab. You can go look at the source code. It starts to get daunting pretty quickly if you want to go beyond just trying to understand what these tools are doing and start building your own, but to explore things at the scale that we're talking about and to have as much fine-grain control over the questions we ask and the answers that we were looking for, you really do need to start building your own stuff. And that gets intimidating very, very quickly, but also do it in a way that's efficient so that you're not waiting years and years for an answer is hard. And, and that's where a lot of existing studies break down.And none of us, all the researchers who are valiantly trying to do this, it's just, they run into these limits. There are limits in terms of training, exposure, proficiency in software programming, access to compute resources that it goes on and on. And so when we did this study about almost 10 years ago on Oaxaca, we sort of set a bar as myself and an archeologist named Sarah Barber who's at the University of Central Florida. She and I went to grad school together. We set this bar almost 10 years ago on what it would take to do what Stefani was describing in terms of modeling large-scale movement with fine spatial detail.And the community looked at that and said, oh, that's a lot. We really can't do that. So we set this really high bar. And then what Stefani I did with this next paper was raised it again. To her point if you kind of tell him to the back pages of our article, she did all this work to kind of tally up on a per study basis. How many routes these studies have calculated? It's a rough metric, but she said, you know, there's tens, hundreds, thousands. You know, some of the more ambitious ones kind of get up into the tens of thousands. Our original study at Oaxaca generated over 4 million paths.One we did several years later in the Mayan region was like 33 million paths, something like that. And then this was 125 billion if I remember correctly off the top of my head. Michael Garfield (20m 2s): It's daunting.To put that in context. One of the things that I appreciated in reading your research history in this piece was, I mean, most people are, I think, familiar with genomic models of migration and you make a really good point that the genomic models are limited by the resolution of genomic data, which is generational. So the timescale that you have is course, right? Like you're talking what like 15 to 20 years is your pixel.You've expended that so vastly and in both directions. And you make the point that you're using human scale agents in this, but you're also looking at this continental scale, very granular model. And I'd like to hear you talk little bit about the features that you identified as salient features and the considerations that you applied, the design of this hypothetical agents, moving through the landscape here to give bookends to the very big and the very small that are all feeding into this 125 billion simulations that you ran here.Stefani Crabtree (21m 13s): I think we need to jump forward to why did Devin and I start deciding to model within Australia and Sahul in 2017 in American summer. So Australian winter, I spent time in the Western desert with the Martu Aboriginal people, living with them, hunting, goanna lizards, doing all kinds of things. And I drove myself out from the airport in Newman to Barnwell and then had a rental.And I was given the advice, if you get a flat tire, anything on the dirt road, don't go anywhere, bring a lot of water. And I was given this apocryphal story of these bank robbers who stole a car in Newman and then drove out to the Western desert and didn't have enough water. And they pop their tires. They wandered out and didn't know where they were going and they died. And then they were eaten by goanna lizards. And so I was given this story as this like scare tactic of don't go anywhere if you pop your tires.And so it was kind of a little intimidated driving out there, but as this beautiful landscape, and once I got to the Western desert, it was very clear that something that seems inhospitable to someone who hasn't been there is somebody's garden for someone who's grown up there. I mean, it's the same thing for New Mexico where it's this beautiful landscape if you've spent time there, but the first time someone from New York comes there and you take them to tent rocks, they're terrified. They're like, oh my God, what if I wander off this path?I'm going to die instantly. But if you've spent time there, you know what signs to look for. And so my experience with Martu, people of wandering within the Western desert to go hunting for goanna was starting to realize that they were queuing on to environmental cues. That were things that may not be easy to recognize when you're not from there, but that there was nothing in the desert that is surprising to anyone.Tthat was kind of an aha moment of trying to look at migration.And my postdoc from 2017 to 2019 at Penn State working with Doug and Rebecca Bird was working in Australia. And so Devin and I were interested in looking at migration within this area. And we connected to Sean Ulm and Michael Bird, no relation, and Corey Bradshaw and Fred Trey and others who were interested in this question of the first people. So moving from my project for my postdoc was working with ethnographic data, people within last 50 years, but we then decided to start working 70,000 years ago. So what kinds of things can we understand about people and how people move and how people reason within their landscape, people today, whose brands are similar to modern humans who migrated out of Africa we'll say by 150,000 years ag., We have the same brains. We have the same way of reasoning.What are the things that people would have come into contact with? And how would people have understood this greater landscape when they're encountering novel types of fauna. There is Australian megafauna at the time, but they still need water. They still need to move. They're moving on foot. So I interviewed some of the elders in the Western desert about how they moved within the Western desert until 1964, when they were moved to missions on the periphery of their areas.So until 1964, they lived traditional nomadic life ways. And so I asked all these questions. How much water did you carry? I learned that they carried these bark cloths full of water, and it was about 10 kilos. I almost said 10 kilometers of water, 10 kilos of water. The most that they'd walked during the day would be about 30 kilometers. But you know, that's a little muscle may not be a depending upon the weather. And they would look to high points on the landscape to orient themselves.Because a lot of the time you'd kind of be walking and you'd be hunting and then you'd go, oh, where am I? And you need to look up and you kind of orient yourself and you'd have this mental map. And this mental map would be kind of a top down thing. If you look at a lot of traditional paintings, they're actually landscapes. And they're showing you this dot painting of the world of how people would wander around within there. And it's based on what they see on the ground, but they have this piece together, this larger landscape.And so we came up with these kinds of ideas of how they would walk and then who would walk. Well, it turns out that women, a lot of the times keep the family together. And so if we're going to model who is leading the pack, because they're going to have different caloric requirements, that's why we chose a 25 year old woman. She's kind of midway through her reproductive years, probably has some small kids with her that she's having to coax along. If you've ever walked anywhere with a four-year-old, you know, you need to coach them along.If you have a child, you might be carrying it in addition to the water that you're carrying. So all of these requirements we then have to put into a digital person. So how does a digital person make sense of this novel landscape and how do they move throughout it and how do they choose when they're moving from one space to the next. And so Devin, as he talked about before developed this model called from everywhere to everywhere, which is literally that. So we're not looking at that one point to the one point. We're looking at on a pixel by pixel basis.What are the costs of traveling from here to here and here and here and here, you know, looking at all of the spaces around you. So thinking about it like a checkerboard or something where we're not just moving like a rook, we're moving everywhere like the queen. That kind of formed the basis of how we were looking at these from everywhere to everywhere models. And then the other thing is when I say cost, I'm not meaning money, I'm meaning calories. What does it cost for you to walk uphill versus downhill?Those are different, but they both cost something. You know, when you're going downhill, a steep slope, you might be breaking a lot. If you're carrying a lot of water that might make something a little different. If you're going across a Rocky terrain, that might be different. And so all of these kinds of things need to go into this model. And so that was kind of my fact-finding mission was getting all that data together. And then that's when we kind of came together and we're like, okay, we have all these ideas, now how do we put it together into this model, the largest ever migration model into a new continent where there are not digital elevation models. So we had to create those, how do we then model people coming in here?Devin White (28m 22s): I'm glad you mentioned costs because you know, that's something I've thought about for years. It was one of the most humbling aspects of the early days of this research. And I started out as most archeologists do. You model the cost that you can understand? And it's easy to do this in terms of like distance or time, but that's what we're a lot of the tools do is what our GPS driven routing applications on our phones allow us to do. Stefani Crabtree (28m 45s): Andmore efficient route by two minutes. Would you like to take it?Devin White (28m 50s): But there's traffic in that direction now. So it makes sense that that's where you would start. What I quickly realized though, was cost was going to be more complex and we needed to be thinking about more sophisticated conceptions of what cost means to somebody traveling, especially through a really inhospitable landscape and the caloric work that Stefani's referring to, it's interesting. It goes back to the sixties and seventies, interestingly enough, it has its origins in the us army. They were actually trying to understand caloric expenditure of soldiers, moving over different kinds of terrain, different environmental conditions.So they put all these port kids on treadmills with different weights of stuff in their backpacks. And they tried to do as big a demographic slice as they could get in terms of just trying to understand the variability. So there are some limits that we recognize up front in terms of our ability to estimate caloric expenditure for non-Western non-military populations. But there are some aspects of the equations these guys generated going back again into the sixties and seventies that give you some reasonable insights as to what it's going to likely cost you if you're going to be walking at a certain speed on a certain slope uphill or downhill, carrying a certain amount of weight, and you're a certain age carrying a certain amount with you and over certain kinds of terrain.So, you know, walking through sand is going to cost you differently than walking through a brush area in a forest environment, or just like on open pavement. And so there's different costs involved there. And, but even with that, I thought when I started this research, initially Stefani mentioned this earlier that I was working in this really inhospitable part of the Southwest. It's the Western Papa Berea, which is actually right on the border of Mexico. So it's, it's this part of Arizona along the diagonal. That is a really, really difficult place to be.These days is actually occupied by the air force and the Marine Corps. It’s the Barry Goldwater air force gunnery and bombing range. A really interesting place to do your dissertation research, by the way. There's a whole set of stories there about just trying to navigate the complexities of working with any military bureaucracy to get out to this beautiful, pristine landscape and understand these ancient trail systems that are out there. And I thought, great. You know, I got this caloric approach. It'll make sense. People are efficient when they travel the economist fall into these traps all the time as well in terms of people being efficient, rational actors.And I was able to model fairly successfully big chunks of this ancient trail system that I can actually see from space using satellites. But I would identify ancient trails. I would go out on the landscape, ground truth them, map them out, and then generate theoretical models based on these cost estimate equations. And to see if they would line up. It was sort of the early days of the research and there's certain areas that work beautifully, but there are these couple of areas where I was working with the archeologist on the range at the time, but Adrienne Rankin, who just knows that place inside and out, she's been there a very long time.And I kept pointing to this one area. This area doesn't make any sense. Like the trails just aren't doing anything like I would remotely expect that people are trying to move efficiently. And she said, well, two things, one, you don't understand the landscape, as well as the people who've been living there for a very long time. And granted that's a very good point. And she says, also, you maybe need to think a little differently about what they are valuing in terms of what are they trying to minimize as costs? I spend enough time out in this region to understand that that area was what archeologists would call a ritual landscape.That the goal moving around in that area was not about efficiently getting from point A to point B. It was about getting between these very important sacred places. And so it was a completely different kind of movement. So it got me thinking about how do you quantize that? How do you actually get that into a model where it's squishy or so to speak? It's not slope, it's not temperature. It's not time. It's the value people were putting on reaching a place and that place matters. And it doesn't matter how much it costs you physically to get there.Sometimes making the journey more difficult is the point. If you think about a lot of pilgrimages that we even see today, like the whole point is for it to be difficult because it's supposed to be a struggle to get there. I always had this in the back of my mind since then. It was very humbling. And when stuff approached me about this project, and she told me about these interactions she had had with these Aboriginal communities and the things that they valued as they move it, brought this all back again. How can we try to encode difficult to encode things into a model at this scale? And so the visibility piece in particular was the most difficult that no one's ever really tried this before.Because we knew prominent things on the landscape were important. We heard this from the people who were descended from the ones who first came into the continent and then it became, how do we actually like put that into a model? To some extent it was a geographic information-science to the rescue again, where there's a computational approach called Bewsha modeling where you can simulate a person standing at a spot, and then you ask like, what can they see? So anyone who's played like a first person shooter video game has experienced this where you're in a 3d environment and you're presented with the thing that you can see based on your physical constraints.What we ended up doing though is running those sorts of calculations at the continental scale at regular intervals and kind of building up what we'll call a heat map of the most visible places from wherever you happen to be standing. So what would be visually attractive or visually approachable from anywhere? And so as you did that, you ended up kind of creating a probability model for the most attractive visual places on the entire continent. And then we figured out how to boil that down into an estimate you could put into the model so that a traveler as they were moving could factor that into their sort of internal mental map as, okay, I need to go this direction versus this other direction.Because I can see that thing over there. And as a visual, a landmark in an otherwise very, very flat place. And it's something that's an anchor for me. That is probably one of the biggest things that we introduced into the model that took me the longest time to figure out what it was, how to encode that information, but it made all the difference in the world with respect to the results. We tried the more practical approach of modeling early on in this project and the results weren't lining up very well. But as soon as we went back and really thought about figuring out how to get the decision processes and the mental map of the Aboriginal communities, at least with this one factor of visibility, getting that built into the model.So suddenly things started to line up much more nicely. And again, it's just very humbling to think through that. Anytime we make a travel decision, anytime we move, we're optimizing against a lot of things. Some of them are conscious, some are unconscious and how do we get a window into that? So we can build a better understanding of how people are moving. I'll get off my soap box here. Stefani Crabtree (35m 12s): I justwanted to add two little things to that. And one is that the heuristics that we're using for these people who lived 70,000 years ago, who are the ancestors of the people who I worked with, we're not saying that the people who are there today are a representation of these people. You know, we're not falling into that trope of anthropology from a hundred years ago, but we are saying is that there are similarities between how people reason and how people move about the landscape that are likely to be rather similar and things that we can use in a computer model to these people's great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandparents who came in there. And so that's where this beautiful view shed analysis comes in, where we know that everywhere people navigate, when you can't see where you're going, based on high terrain, if you don't have a map and you're put somewhere, you will orient yourself based on what you can see and people in the Western desert do that. And people probably did that when they first got into Sahul 70,000 years ago or so.And I don't remember the other thing I was going to say.Michael Garfield (36m 28s): That's just fine because actually between what you both have just said, there's like this very interesting kind of gem of correlations that I want to try and articulate and then pass back to you so that you can kind of riff on this. I love Devin, you bringing up this whole question about the tension between the remote sensing satellite piece and ground truthing something not just by walking the terrain, but by understanding how other people that inhabit that environment are walking that terrain.I'm reflecting on a conversation. I had recently with Andrea Wulf who wrote the Invention of Nature, the story about Alexander Von Humboldt and the origins of modern ecology and climate science. And she puts the narrative high point of his scientific adventure at the literal high point of his travels at the peak of Chimborazo standing at the top of this mountain, which by the way, indigenous guides led him there without which he could not have done this work.It's important to acknowledge that hisNaturegemälde,thismasterpiece of science communication, that he comes back with this showing all of the different vegetation that occupies different heights, different altitudes. There is this question about what it is that makes a site sacred. Why is it that it's the holy mountain and not the holy Arroyo? And it seems like it has to do with this relationship that we have with our environments and the use of visual cues. Like when JFK says we choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard or George Mallory says he climbed Everest because it was there.It is so prominent, so information bearing getting up there. The fact that most of the explanatory power seems in your models to have come from visual prominence is really interesting just as a sort of meta on how it is that you're doing the research for this paper and the way that you're combining. I was just reading some of the work by Lauren Klein of Emory University who came and gave a talk here at SFI earlier this year on data feminism, talking about distant versus close readings and like how you combine the distant reading of a text and the close reading of a text.And there is a really interesting formulation. Living here in Santa Fe, the El Camino Ray, all this ancient trade route that now a huge stretch of that thousands of years old trail is Agua Fria. You know, it's the street that runs through the center of the town. And so you get these questions about the way that we paraphrase Winston Churchill, like we make the paths and then the paths make us. Our sacred maps of the landscape not just imposed arbitrarily by our emergent, from this relationship that we have with the landscape and with non-human entities, with the ecological engineering animals that are helping to shape that landscape. Thinking about the heuristics that you're talking about the visual cues, the fresh water least cost stuff, what this says about a general law for search. That's not simply true of humans, but it's true of agents in general.And you know, how you navigate an information bearing landscape. And it lands in the kinds of questions that SFI economists like Sam Bowles, Wendy Carlin, and Suresh Naidu, and I do are gesturing toward with their core economics project where they're saying people only look crazy because you're looking at human behavior through this extremely chorus model that assumes basically like caloric expenditure rather than a much broader and multifarious definition of value that is actually this multidimensional value is the way that we encode much more profound information about the environments that we're trying to navigate.Devin White (40m 28s): It's interesting you highlight that because, if you think about it, when you're traveling, it is a type of transaction. You are exchanging one kind of set of resources for some kind of angle. In this case, it's you moving to a different location. So you're constantly doing this optimization in your head. If you, even, if you don't realize that about, it's worth it for me to go from this place to this other place. And so there's a lot of parallels there too. I think economic theory about how people make decisions regarding things like near term versus like term goals and gains like where I'm traveling tomorrow could be different than where I'm going a month from now.And as you're moving into a new landscape, that's a whole interesting set of factors to consider because there's just so many unknowns. But I also wanted to touch on something else. You mentioned a few minutes ago about one of the structural weaknesses of a lot of least cost analysis approaches is if you do these point-to-point analysis where it's just a couple of 10, 20, 30, hundreds of haves, you're doing these point to point transactions. You're getting these little glimpses into how people are negotiating with their landscapes and how the landscapes are affecting their movement and vice versa. And you get these tiny little glimpses.You don't start to see the big sort of emergent pattern of that landscape and how it could structure human movement until you do something like what we did in this study. And that's really the origin of why we developed this from everywhere to everywhere approached so many years ago is we were interested not in any particular movement from one place to another, but from anywhere you might start, like, what would the landscape do to channel that movement? One of my former colleagues at Oak Ridge called it a pedestrian hydrology, like you're pouring a bunch of water on the landscape and you'd see where it flows. David Malakoff the writer for Science, he mentioned it as dropping a bunch of marbles on landscape and seeing where they go. That's really what we're after here is these general things that the landscape permits or restricts us from doing. And then how do we adapt to that? But then also how do we take advantage of what the landscape is offering to us and here's how we move around. And so it's like a negotiation and a dialogue as you go not to get too meta on you about it. The longer we've done this, the more we start to see this and you get away with those transactional studies and you really start thinking about these bigger problems, then you start wandering into other disciplines and then thinking about how these ways that we've explored optimized travel, depending on how you define costs, can impact studies in other things.And I'm interested in stuff's thoughts on this as well. Stefani Crabtree (42m 45s): Whenyou brought up the idea of transactional and the things that you get of landscape, you're also giving something in return where you're creating a path and these paths have permanence. And we see that actually.If you kind of look at the paths that we created, these superhighways the ones that were chosen the most often by people. When you first go through a landscape, you might be creating those footprints. Imagine being the first person snowshoeing through open meadow covered in new snow, and you can put those snow shoes anywhere, but then you come back at the end of the day and everyone's followed your path because you've made it easier for them.Well, these people are doing the same thing. They're going across. Maybe they're following game trails of kangaroos are larger megafauna, but once those paths are there, they're going to keep being chosen. If they choose to not go on the path, that's an interesting thing, but people are going to choose that easier route. We call it the landscape architecture, the underlying geophysical constraints of the landscape make people move. And then people keep continuing those. You can see those paths and stock routes and the colonial routes from a hundred, 200 years ago, being kind of similar to where our super highways go.We see this within our Sahul paper, but also you bring up Agua, Fria and the community and all that.  Whenever I run into people who are lost in Santa Fe, and they're having such a hard time. I'm like, you need to stop thinking like a car and start thinking like a Jesuit priest and a mule. You're at this Santa Fe and a lot of Northern New Mexico is very much constrained by a lot of the Jesuit movements and a lot of the indigenous movements and a lot of the pack animal movements.And those movements are not going to be the same kind of straight roads like you get here in Utah that are optimized for white colonial settlers who show up 150 years ago or so. And so they're very straight, very rigid. You can count them, but in near Mexico, they're wandering because you're following the arroyo, you're following the high places. That style of route is very similar to what we see in south hall and are from everywhere to everywhere analysis. We make these 125 billion pathways.These are how do people move throughout the entire continent over and over again. And I remembered my point from before. We're building up complexity, we're starting with the Knoll model, the knollest of knolls. And then we're looking at freshwater needs. We're looking at the needs for orienting yourself based on those high prominent places, which is how people would have navigated in Santa Fe 400 years ago, using the high places where you see Fort Marcy now. Avoiding the arroyos, especially that sand can break an animal's ankles walking near them, but not in them.Those kinds of things are shaping the movement. And so while we start with 125 billion pathways, those aren't the paths that people are choosing. They're choosing some subset of that amount and those paths are being chosen over and over and over again. They're being inscribed and incised into the landscape so that we could still use them today. If I were to hand the map that Devin and I and our coauthors made to anyone and teleported you to the middle of Australia and said, okay, you're in Farmar.I want you to walk to Perth. Here's a map. You could do it because we're using the geographic, the geologic underlying constraints of this landscape that have been there for 70,000 years and longer, because right, it's a continent that's been formed by billions of years of geologic processes. But if I were to give that to you, Michael Garfield, you would be able to take that and walk because you would know where the high points are. It might not be your favorite walk, but you'd be able to do it.It's still there. Devin White (46m 46s): Yousee the same thing on the east coast as well. If you look at some of the earliest historic accounts for Western society settlers, those trails generally started out as a game trails that then the native communities followed and then inscribed. And then we started following them. Then they became wagon routes. Then they became roads. And now they're part of our infrastructure. And it gets interesting questions about how does that sort of transportation network structure the way cities look today. And it just keeps going and going. I was also reminded of this several years ago when we had the opportunity to take the speed approach and actually apply it to a modern-day situation.We were looking at the movement of refugees out of Syria, absolutely horrific situation. And the question was, could we apply this technology in a way that you could create like an anticipatory map of where they might go based on their concerns and their worries and their fears and just what was open to them and try to meet them where they were even at borders and try to help them, so this is very much a humanitarian assistance and disaster response activity we were working on before I got to San Diego. And what was really interesting about this. It was several anthropologists working on this.And one of them pointed out that some of these main routes that we were able to ground-truth, refugees really were taking these routes. And they've been important well into antiquity that many of these routes were ancient road systems through Syria. There were just persist to this day because they are just the most efficient ways to get around for a variety of reasons. And they've just stayed deeply inscribed in this landscape. And it was just the natural way for people to flow. So a lot of what we develop isn't just good for sort of projecting into the past, but we can also apply it to, to modern day and future scenarios. Not that I want to shift the conversation in that direction right now, but kind of just want to give you a teaser that we started to look into this and it speaks directly to what you would highlight it and stuffI brought up that many of these routes become deeply inscribed. And until you not only something about the human relationship to that place, but also you see it reflected in architecture and city organization and just how you move in general and even potentially how you think, because you're just in a different environment. You know, the Western U.S. versus the Eastern U.S. cities and built environment looks very different. Some of that is structured, I think because of some of these very ancient relationships between people in the landscape and how you move across it. And some of that's based on geology, some of that's based on other motivations for travel, as we've talked about.Michael Garfield (48m 57s): This is reminiscent for me anyway of research awhole bunch of SFI people were involved in Mike Price, David Wolpert, Hajime Shimao, Brendan Tracey, Tim Kohler. It was a paper led by Jaeweon Shin. I hope I'm saying that right,scale and information processing thresholds in Holocene, social evolution, talking about the ways that we invent new information technologies. It seems from their analysis, it looks like major evolutionary transitions. We reach a scale of society that we need to organize new Infotech and that's, and that's where we are.I mean, if you zoom out far enough, that's the story that we're telling about remote sensing and computation and a global civilization.From that point of view, it's just funny to reflect on how, I don't know who it was. I heard say this, but you can always tell what the most important feature of a society is by the tallest building.Used to be the church. The BBC's in our time has a great episode on this, about how arguably modern banking in the west started with the temple of Athena and then like borrowing your tributes back from the goddess Athena.So the temple became like a loaning organization. And then now if you go to somewhere like Austin, Texas, the tallest building in the city is the bank. What we're actually seeing is we've crossed this threshold between the geographical features, having prominence to the society that the landscape agency sort of constrained and sculpted. Perhaps the least cost thing, since you did bring it up would be deeper applications of this model.You did say let's not rush into the future here. So let's take a detour into the past and the controversy surrounding the peopling of the American continents. This is an area where I think a lot of people passionate about archeology have strongly held opinions about this. And it seems like your team might be able to shed some new light on this particularly contentious question.Stefani Crabtree (51m 2s): There's somedebate in Australia and well people who study Australia on when people got there. People definitely got there by about 40,000 years ago, but the date has been pushed back quite a bit, but there still was it 50, was it 55? Was it 7 million? There's still debate there. And there will be debate there for a long time. There's a debate in the Americas about when people got to the Americas and how they got here, whether it was by land or by sea or both. There are people who are very staunchly,well, if it was by land, it couldn't have been before the Clovis technology because it was impassable.But then there's this idea of people kind of voting along the shore. And there've been various archeological studies that have given us dates that were controversial. But about a week ago today being June 18th, there was a study that came out in nature that redated the collect Scotland cave study, where the dates that had some controversial old dates and the new study says 20,000 years old, which is very much so before the Clovis technologies showed up.I think that hypothetical use of feet to look at people coming in by land and people coming in by sea, and then looking at the spreads of people throughout and looking at the demographic processes of the spreads of people throughoutand how quickly could you get people in these different areas like the Southern tip of Patagonia, where there are controversial dates of 20, 24,000 years old. I'm sure we'll be better dated soon. This would be a way to weigh in and say, people were likely here before, or they could have been if they followed these kinds of models. A lot of the time computer models are oldmodels.And they look at ways of taking the fragmentary record that we have, whether that's of archeological data or looking at refugee migrations, things that are probable and possible that we don't have data for, or various other things like that. And kind of connect the pieces and say, if this is what happens, this is what you'll see. In a way, feet could be a way to ask those kinds of questions. If people were coming in by boat and we'd have to have a good model of that migration and then where those places of embarkation would be and how people would spread throughout and where that spread process would be.And then we could apply some kind of agent-based model or cellular automaton model to look at people moving on those highways and how people would spread out. That would be one way to address the Clovis first controversy. I'm not going to weigh in on Clovis first. That's not where I work, but obviously like every archeologist, I have opinions based on my reading of the literature, but I think that computer models would be a good way to weigh in on controversy.It's something that I've done before with the paper weighing in on controversy. There's been controversy about whether there was a hierarchical ritual structure in the Southwest, or if it was egalitarian and you can use computational models to look at that. And I wrote about that in 2017 and as a person who is a peace-loving person I like to always show that there's a middle ground. So I'm sure that the use of feet or something similar would be able to show that yes, even Clovis first and non-club is first people can get along.Devin White (54m 40s): One of the things that Stefani mentioned about, the whole by land or by sea ideas is something that I've grappled with for more than10 years now, iswe built, pedestrian travel model. And if you're going to integrate any kind of maritime component to it, you have to kind of think about travel and movement and cost in a different way. And it's daunting, is something that even after we did the Oaxaca study almost 10 years ago, Stacey Barber said, well, what about modeling trade in canoes along the coast?Because that that's a really important aspect of how societies at the time that were sort of in charge would have moved around. Like how do we do this? And I was like, oh shoot. Like, that's really, really hard.Modeling people just moving around on solid ground is pretty difficult. If you start putting them on a liquid medium with all these dynamic things going on, temperature and currents and everything, it just becomes very hard. One of the things that has come out of us publishing this paper, this has been some outreach in particular, from some research communities interested in looking at, for example, how the entire Pacific was populated. Getting to these remote places, getting to these islands, these little specks of land in the middle of this massive ocean landscape just requires a different way of sort of thinking through how people would move and peopling of the Americas kind of as a bit of a hybrid here because we would want to explore and would like to show if we went down this road in some fashion or enabled people to do sowhat these flows of people would look like coming through the land corridors when they're available, but also trying to, at least as much as we could accurately, I'm going to air quote here, accurately model maritime movement to this question keeps coming up again.And again, is people move by water too. How do you incorporate that? Or at the point from a technological point of view, and also for my mental peace of mind that I think we could probably try to take this on. So I have this outreach after the paper came out from a group that was looking at how the entire Pacific got populated, which takes the Australia studywe did, and just blows it up even larger. I mean, it just makes my head hurt and thinking about trying to take on something that day,Stefani Crabtree (56m 41s): People have looked at boat moving. I mean, there was a study at least cost analysis looking at how people could have gotten to Sahul and then a colleague of mine, M.S.Slayton who's at Carnegie Mellon for her dissertation looked at least cost analysis throughout the Caribbean, and has also looked at how could rice have gotten from mainland China to islands on a recent paper with Jesse Lasky, from Penn State. So people are looking at it, but it would be that amazing combination of the two that I think would really advance that kind of work.And also just on the scale of the work that we did, the 125 billion routes, that is the kind of scale of analysis that would be needed for understanding the peopling of the South Pacific, since it came in different waves with different cultures, and there are now so many different language groups.Devin White (57m 33s): It feels like the next frontiers is these sorts of massive movement questions in other parts of the world. I mean, we make that argument in the paper that we would really love to see the fundamentals of our approach picked up and applied in different areas. Part of it is to see how well they do, but also is just how generalizable are some of the things that we foundtoother cases of large scale human movement as a function of time across the globe, be it on land it in water or some combination thereof and keeping that big scale aspect to it rather than zooming into a small area.Although it does work at that level too. You have to kind of tune this for the question you're asking. And another one of the modern examples that'd be, can always explore depending on time and interest, is it, you have something like a really detailed 3d model of a city. For example, one of the things we do in the remote sensing world is that we collect laser scanning data over large geographic areas, but it's a very, very fine resolution. And you can reconstruct three-dimensional landscapes, fine level of detail to the point where you could have a city in 3d, how would you model movement using the technologies that we've developed through that kind of landscape?So, the computational complexities there is just you've narrowed down your geographic emphasis, but you can still explore these really fascinating questions. So the one case we did this that I've been involved in, it was after the earthquake in Haiti, when their infrastructure just blew up. Bridges fell, roads collapsed, just became impassable. And so everyone was moving around on foot through the city environment. And we need to understand, again, from a humanitarian assistance point of view, having the Google maps at that point, wasn't going to help us because that's not the reality of the people on the ground. And luckily that was at the Rochester Institute of Technology through a UN fund was able to get down there very quickly.And they flew a laser scanner over Porter Prince. And Haiti came back with this really rich 3d data set, which is publicly available. Anyone can download it. And with it today, the whole goal was to do this as quickly as possible and make the data freely available. So we pulled this massive 3d data set in and ran a pedestrian flow model over the city in this new broken environment. How could people move around? Where might they be versus what the reality would have been prior to the earthquake? It was all about scaling your problem.You can still apply these techniques even down to the scale of a city or a part of a city. And in some archeologists have done this for ancient examples as well. I'm thinking like Scott Branting, who's at UCF who has done this in the middle east. He was one of the early pioneers of the approach. It's exciting stuff. Michael Garfield (59m 60s): Just as an aside, there seems like an obvious link to work that Geoffrey West and Marten Scheffer did with MIT recently on the visitation law, finding those power law relationships in the places that people are choosing, be interesting to dovetail those, but I know that we have a hard stop. I really want to land this conversation in the upcoming SFI press volume, Stefani, that you've been working on,a textbook for agent based modeling for archeology and an article that you led in advances in archeological practice on outreach and archeology with agent-based modeling.There's something that you said in this piece about the use of agent based modeling for communications with stakeholders. I know that in archeology, typically you're talking about cultural resource management. Given the obvious link between this particular paper and approach to studying migration, the conversation I had with Tim Kohler and Marten Scheffer way back in episode 33 on the shifting future human climate niche and their prediction of like billions of displaced people by the end of the century, that makes everybody a stakeholder.So it really invites a set of kind of challenging questions about the way that this research is performed,the tools available to us to communicate it, when are the tools that we can use for research, the same tools that we can use to broaden popular literacy and invite stakeholders into a more interactive rather than merely receptive kind of relationship to this kind of thinking. Just as a nod to the indigenous piece of it.I remember in Interplanetary Fest a couple of years ago, this conversation around, well, you know, for the indigenous dystopian, apocalyptic science fiction is regarded in the past rather than the future that they're already living in the wake of apocalypse. We're really into the big view here, which is when you start to see the systems completely enough, everyone is downstream. Everyone is a stakeholder. Everyone deserves to be involved. I'm curious if we can just close with your thoughts on where this hits the street and how you see the opportunity is for science and public involvement and this kind of thinking in this kind of research changing over years to comeStefani Crabtree (1h 2m 21s): Well, archeology is a really interesting thing because in a lot of ways, everything that we are experiencing today and will experience in the future, somebody in the past experienced,whether that is mass migration of people or massive pandemics or things like that. Those are all things that we can look at data from the past to understand the present and the future. And I think that's one of the strengths of this paper is that we're looking at the possibilities of human movement across a large, somewhat inhospitable, unknown landscape, with different kinds of fauna and flora that people would have never experienced before.And people moved on their feet. And this is going to be the reality of people fleeing, drowning coastlines in the future is that people are going to have to use their pedestrian movement to move from a lot of areas. Wealthy people will probably be able to take planes or cars, but if anyone saw the 1995 movie Independence Day, you know that the LA freeways get blocked up when the aliens invade. Well, it'll probably be relatively the same. If we have massive amounts of coastline change very rapidly. The ability for people to use their big brains to move through inhospitable terrain is something that we'll have to do in the future.And so this kind of approach is very useful. Archeology is also something studying the past, studying our ancestors is something that most children have had an interest in. Whenever I tell people I'm an archeologist on the airplane, they always say I wanted to do that when I was a kid. And so you're right, Michael, the stakeholders are everyone, but computational modeling is a thing of taking what we know about the past and using these hypotheticals. And it's very game-like and it's a way for people to integrate their understanding of the past and watch it unfold.And so in that way, the textbook that I have, and that paper that you mentioned are ways of trying to get more people involved and understanding computational approaches for social science applications. Archeology is not just digging in the dirt and finding a pot. It is understanding everything about humanity in the past. Archeologists have to be psychologists. We have to be economists. We have to be able to read these old army reports to understand how people move.So in this way, the textbook is aimed at being veryaccessible for teaching people computational approaches and ways to integrate other kinds of computational work and social science work together to understand humanity. And so really, I do think archeology can save the world because we can look at the ways that people in the past have dealt with this in an ethical way, use these computational models to try and better our present and our future. Michael Garfield (1h 5m 14s): That was fabulous. It was really wonderful to talk to you both. I am left with so many more questions for you, but perhaps we'll have another chance to have you on the show. Thanks depo, Devin. And I could talk for hours. Thank you very much, Michael. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you.Speaker 1 (1h 5m 36s): Thank you for listening.

64,  Episode Notes The popular conception of ants is that “anatomy is destiny”: an ant’s body type determines its role in the colony, for once and ever. But this is not the case; rather than forming rigid castes, ants act like a distributed computer in which tasks are re-allocated as the situation changes. “Division of labor” implies a constant “assembly line” environment, not fluid adaptation to evolving conditions. But ants do not just “graduate” from one task to another as they age; they pivot to accept the work required by their colony in any given moment. In this “agile” and dynamic process, ants act more like verbs than nouns — light on specialization and identity, heavy on collaboration and responsiveness. What can we learn from ants about the strategies for thriving in times of uncertainty and turbulence?What are the algorithms that ants use to navigate environmental change, and how might they inform the ways that we design technologies? How might they teach us to invest more wisely, to explore more thoughtfully?Welcome to COMPLEXITY, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute.

65,Episode Details / Transcript Katherine Collins (0s): I kind of liken the economy to a person. You can gain 30 pounds cause you're having a baby and it's awesome. You can gain 30 pounds because you ate a lot of pizza it's not so awesome. And you know, the economy is the same way. The economy can grow in a way that is improving overall health and wellbeing and capacity of the whole, including the individuals within the whole, or it can grow in a way that is extractive and divisive. And the headline number is the same, but it's not the same implication at all.So this past year, I think for all of us has been a chance both personally and professionally to kind of step back and ask that essential question of why have I been on the path I've been on? Is it enough? Is it enough on all the dimensions that in some cases are newly illuminated to me? And if not, what might make sense from here?Michael Garfield (1m 14s): We are all investors. We all make choices all the time about our allocation of time, calories, attention, even our bodies. Our behavior and anatomy represent investment in specific strategies for navigating an evolving world. And yet most people treat the world of finance as if it is somehow separate from the rest of life, including people who design the tools of finance or who come up with economic theories. Many of the world's problems can be traced back to this fundamental error and by extension, many of the problems we create for other life forms on this planet. What changes when we take the time to pause and listen and reflect on how the biosphere already works? How do we balance innovation with sustainability or growth with resource distribution? Could a careful study of nature, not only lead to better business outcomes, but also help us heal the living world?Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week, we talked to SFI as new board chair, Katherine Collins, Head of Sustainable Investing at Putnam about insights encoded in her book The Nature of Investing. We discuss how investing has transformed in the 21st century and what new challenges have emerged because of it.The tragedy of value capture, the push and pull between sustainability and efficiency, the consequential differences between risk and uncertainty problems and mysteries, how multiple times skills interact to produce complexity in the market, balancing growth and development and what all this means for those who want to do good and not just well with their investments?

Katherine Collins. It's a pleasure to have you on Complexity Podcast. So you just became the new board chair at SFI. So welcome. And in preparation for this call, you sent me your delightful book, The Nature of Investing: Resilient Investment Strategies Through Biomimicry. We'll link to this in the show notes. This is the product of a nonlinear path that you have traced in your life, I guess, as the crow actually flies rather than as the crow proverbially flies, if you can trace your strange path in and out of and back into the world of investing so that we can anchor this conversation, as I know you and I both like to do in the human, the personal, and the biographical.Katherine Collins (4m 21s): Absolutely. For the sake of trackability, let me split things into three major sections. So I had a very long initial chapter right out of college as an investor at Fidelity, one of the largest investment firms. I thought it would be there two years and figure out something about the stock market, learn something useful and move along with my life. And it turned out I love it. I love it so much. And the thing that surprised me is that at least for long-term fundamental investors, if you are a curious person and you just want to learn more and more and more about how things are made in the world and how different systems connect with one another and what might be emerging in the future, it is an amazing perch.And so I spent 18 years in that first long arc of very traditional investing. So doing heartful long-term fundamental research, which basically means you try to find out everything you can about a company or an industry, whatever it is you're investing in. And by having that more complete understanding, hopefully over time, you're making better and better decisions. So I loved that curious element and kind of the open-ended connected to our world element of investing that I started with. But during that period, a lot of things were developing, some of which were specific to the financial field, but some of which were more universal.We found that like a lot of professions, the more expert you get the narrower your professional field or scope tends to be over time. And I wanted my scope to be broadening and not narrowing in this specialized way. So there was a little bit of a push and a pull there. And then the second element that was a challenge is I had been interested in sustainability issues or what we now would call sustainability issues really all through my life, doing a lot of transdisciplinary kind of research all through my time in college and really all through my investment career as well.But increasingly we were finding that there was a little tension there also. The sustainability conversations are happening in one place and the financial conversations are happening at another place. And we weren't yet so great at translating between the two. So my second big chapter was to do a really deep dive to try to get closer to the roots of sustainability. So this is the period during which I wrote the book that you just referenced. I did a Master's Degree at Harvard Divinity School, studied philosophy. I had my own independent research firm, which I kind of described as the time to take the things that are in the corner of your whiteboard that you're going to think about someday, but the day never comes. I took 10 years to dive into that list of things. And I studied biomimicry and natural systems during this period with the idea that natural systems are a much better framework for thinking about not just the financial markets, but investing in general in a way that is closer to how the world actually functions as opposed to kind of a factory model. And so now I'm delighted to say this third chapter is my work at Putnam. I'm the first head of sustainable investing at the firm. I've been there four years now. It's combining all of that at long last into one giant role, which is intended to connect the dots to make better investment decisions by having this more complete kind of holistic view of what is kind of true cost, true benefit from a company and investment perspective.Michael Garfield (7m 40s): I mean, it seems like one of the nuggets of wisdom that comes out of this book is that taking the shortest on-ramp doesn't necessarily get you there in the way that you want.Katherine Collins (7m 57s): So that's a very gracious interpretation. Yes.Michael Garfield (8m 1s): And as a career ranter I think I am sympathetic to that. You start this book by talking about three changes that you invite people to undergo with you, to rearrange to reframe and to refrain. And I would like to start there, if you can, if you want to just provide a little bit of exposition here about what you mean specifically with those three terms. And I think that that'll give us a good launching off point to get into some of the nuance in this book. Katherine Collins (8m 32s): So again, the premise of the book is that the practice of investing in maybe even more particularly the practice of finance that goes along with it is pretty often seen as sort of a more mechanized, more transactional set of activities. And there's a role for that transactional element. I don't mean to be dismissive about it, but when you think about the real purpose of investing in the thing that gets me really excited to make this my profession, the idea is that you want to be over time creating something of value in the world, not just trading straws around in the same pile over the longer term.And so the three elements I started within the book, these ideas of rearrange, reframe, refrain were an effort to pause before diving right in, and really set that bigger context for everything that was to follow. And so of those three, it's interesting, I get by far the most questions on the last one, which is refrain, the idea that you would pause and maybe do less and not do more as sort of a standard objective is not especially intuitive for a lot of folks.And I really got that directly from my biomimicry studies. And I think had I been trained more formally in science, I would have taken the same thing from that education. The idea that if you really want to understand something, you need to shush and observe and really trying to do nothing but observe for a pretty extended period of time, not to leap to a theory, not to leap to an explanation, not to leap to a judgment, not to go forward with your ideas about how things should work or could be, but to really pause and take in as much as you can about the facts of a given situation.And from there start to really do your work and your inquiry. So I wanted to start the book with that deep breath and that sort of pause like, Hey, what are we really curious about here? What do we wonder about, what do we want to observe in more depth? And from there, you can get to a really interesting place.Michael Garfield (10m 40s): So to get to that really interesting place, and we can try and compress this into the span of a podcast episode, but I mean, the fact that you've written an entire book on it, that is itself a condensation and synthesis of much, much larger ream of experience and research requires a kind of time privilege. And as someone who lives in an extremely fast paced world, and you even mentioned this in the book that it is difficult for many people who are operating within a particular system of incentives to take the time to even have these thoughts.And so, this is where I want to start to map out the problem with you and then start to identify places where biomimicry which is like for our purposes, loosely synonymous with complex systems thinking, offers us some strategies for starting to untie the knot into which we have tangled all of civilization and the biosphere. So like first is like, as part of your reframing, you talk about recognizing ourselves as part of nature, rather than as set aside from it in some way.And you write about this in some really interesting ways in the book that at least for me, seemed to kind of allude to the time that you took away in divinity school. And like this notion of Paul Tillich's ultimate concern like religion as a notion of ultimate concern, or the etymological origin of that word as like a reconnection, which is a process and a virtue that you come back to again and again in this text. And so I like where you start this book. You say, we are all investors, like if you're thinking in terms of metabolism and thermodynamics and evolution, and the idea that every organism represents a metabolic and developmental investment in a particular strategy for navigating an environment that the information aggregation of evolution has modeled and embodies in these organisms and that there is a really lovely non-duality here.So that's us as investors. And then that's also our instruments, which are kind of like species of creatures occupying different niches in this system. I'd love to hear you riff on that a bit and give us some examples of the different kinds of creatures that like to the extent that we have created in our efforts to control the world, that we have created a new wilderness that exists in this deeply abstracted realm of financial agents that it's kind of this like love crafty.We're like on the inside of this giant hyper object, we call the economy. I'd love to hear you go in there as a skilled taxonomist and talk about some of the different financial instruments and investment strategies and how they look to you as an ecological thinker.Katherine Collins (13m 41s): So one thing that is intriguing to me when I talk to my friends who aren't investment professionals is that they reflect on the whole world of finance and sometimes the whole world of capitalism that goes along with it, as, you know, sort of this strange and foreign land that I didn't ask to visit. And now I'm stuck here and I'm not sure I like it. And one thing that's really interesting to me to observe about my own career is this is my hometown. So like it's not perfect.There are some seedy corners in some neighborhoods I'd rather not live, but it's all very comfortable. Once you're in it, it's pretty affluent. I have friends who are pretty senior folks in Washington, and I feel the same way about a lot of things about how government functions and to them that's their hometown. Like they just get it and can maneuver with kind of fluency and ease. So it is a real gift to be able to observe both from the inside and the outside for a system like this. And you alluded to a really important condition in the midst of your query which was the idea that we want to be able to analyze and control things.And I do think that a big point of the book really of the whole huge decade plus body of research that went into it is that there is this root of the desire for control that's at the heart of a lot of structural and kind of interpretive flaws, very hard to separate yourself from a system that you're a part of, but it's even harder if you want to cling to the idea that you somehow are in charge of it. And so this, this is a real challenge for all of us.It's especially challenging. I think for many folks who have been educated in Western educational settings, where you have been taught that if you want to understand something, the first thing you do is you take it apart. And then you kind of dissect all the little pieces and you try to understand all the little pieces, and then maybe if you have time, you kind of reassemble them. And as we all know, and as you know, one of my main motivations for hanging around SFI for so long, as you know, that's not really how a lot of things in the world function. You can't take it apart and put it back together and actually have a complete understanding of things.So this is a challenge within finance and I'd say within a lot of professional settings, probably within a lot of human settings, the idea that the first thing I want to do is disconnect myself from the system and pretend that it's something over there, because once it's over there, I can then take it apart and dissect it and put it back together in a very sort of linear and conventionally logical way. It's a lot more interesting, but also a lot harder to put yourself in the middle of that system and try to understand some of the iterative loops.So to give you a kind of tour of some of the things that are really easily observable, if you're in the middle of investment practice, I'll give you a sense maybe with the concept of feedback loops at the heart of it. So what are the signals that are coming at you every day and how have those changed over time? One really easy and visible signal for all folks, whether, in this profession or not, is the simple signal of price.  Pick a security, any security, Bitcoin hit something from the headlines. If you want to price, it's a pretty intuitive, easily understood signal.When I started in the profession, which was not that long ago to get a real-time price on a security, you either had to be very privileged and working in a professional setting that paid a lot of money to get that real-time price, or you had to be patient and wait until it was printed in the paper the next morning so a whole overnight cycle, and then you could check where the security had closed the day before. We often presume that having real-time pricing is automatically this wondrous thing, but you know, what function does that serve is my question.And there's a narrow set of applications for which that real-time pricing is helpful or efficient, but that doesn't mean it's more effective. And so the default now, when I log in, in the morning, even on my personal devices, let alone my work devices, is a real-time price on everything. And not only that, it just keeps coming unless I proactively turn it off. That is the signal that is literally flashing before my eyes all day, every day. If you're a professional money manager, your relative performance is calculated based on those real-time prices.Now you can hit refresh all day long and just follow the basis points as they come and go. It is mesmerizing, I got to tell you, but it is almost certainly a poor use of time. And so that's just one example of this feedback loop that sort of emerged. And yet who decided that, who opted into it. If you think about the characteristics of it and feedback loop, it's supposed to be relevant information with an effective receptor to take in that information and an appropriate response.Those are the three essential, functional elements. So this is just one example within finance of a very, very loud signal that is almost unavoidable. And yet what is the receptor to take that in and the appropriate response. And should that be a signal at all is a pretty legitimate question. So I'll pause there. I mean, that's one tiny little microcosm, but it's a pretty vivid example of where a system can kind of go seemingly on its own, even though we know we all have a little bit of influence alongMichael Garfield (19m 1s): So this is precisely the kind of ominous Jurassic Parkstuff I wanted to get into with you. You give a couple of really interesting examples. One is the three by three morning star grid, the assessment tool that allows people to bundle particular investments into different classes and then decide, and you tell the story about how your funds were right on the line between these two basically artificially generated categories.And you had people saying, well, if it slips over to the other side of the line, I have to sell, I have to pull out, which is related to something that Jessica Flack and Melanie Mitchell touched on in one of their recent articles for Ionabout bad metrics about grading and like how, as soon as you try assessing students for this particular set of metrics, then they'll achieve that, but they won't actually achieve real learning. And you quote in here Robert Kennedy about GDP, which I don't think anyone listening to this show is going to be shocked by a critique of GDP as an insufficient metric of the health of a nation.But, just to put this in here, because it's such an elegant statement, the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of the education, the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. And yet this is another sort of post on the rat king that we have here. And yet the more we try to measure all of those things, it seems that the more those things, at least in the system, as we have it now become themselves sort of subject to speculation.We found a way to measure them all on the same chart, but that's not the kind of multidimensionality or decentralization that you're talking about. And so there's a tension it seems to me here between true cost accounting and a number of other constraints such as the time that we have to respond to change, or the amount of energetic or computational resources that we have to navigate the complexity. So it's about finding our level. And I'm curious because you give so many examples in this book that are not quantitative metrics, that are qualitative metrics. You talk about the way that learning biomimicry made you feel, you talk about gross national happiness.And so there is this paralyzing question in my mind about how we make the decision in our economic models to limit the scope of that which we quantify, not as a way of intentionally maximizing externalities and creating more efficient gains in the short term, but as a way of actually honoring the sort of natural principle of being no more all-seeing than is actually necessary.Katherine Collins (22m 14s): There's a lot of layers there. And I have a lot of recent examples here too so the work of sustainable investing, as I mentioned, is the intention is to broaden all of that back out and to think about multiple dimensions of health and wellbeing, and by doing so to make better long-term decisions. So all investment relevant in the end, it's not an either or premise. But I'll tell you some of the challenges that have come up. It's the exact same challenge.It's turtles all the way down, right? This push and pull between wanting things to be both efficient and quantifiable. Those are two things that are deeply comfortable for most of us. We live in a very, very uncertain world. And again, one body of work I've benefited from so much related to SFI. And the research there is the distinction between risk and uncertainty, how vital that is and how totally uncomfortable it is to sit in the uncertain part instead of the risky part. If something's a risk it's analyzable and you benefit from doing the analysis.So it's an awesome sort of can do space. And most of us presented with a risk or in theological terms, this would be a problem. You sit with the problem, you dive right in, you analyze. And after analyzing it, you are in a better place to make a better decision. You might be wrong, but you have improved your odds by analyzing it. Something that is uncertain or a mystery in theological terms is not that. It's where it is an analyzable. The outcome is unknown and the range of possible outcomes is also unknown.So a problem you need to sit with, and that is not fun for any of us. And so the tension that you're appointing to this idea that every metric we have, regardless of the topic, is a proxy for something else nine or 10 times out of 10, I would say, and we forget that, right? So we use the metric as if it's sort of a statement of truth, as opposed to a clue about an underlying condition that we're trying to assess. So there's an inherent mismatch at the very root level of almost all metrics that we tend to forget about in part because we're too busy and in part, because it's overwhelming to remind ourselves time and time again, like, oh, this metric, it's just a clue.It's not a conclusion. Don't ever forget. It's not kind of a statement of capital T truth. And that gets harder the more interesting that you make the metrics. So look at the sustainable investment world for example. I have fantastic metrics on the gender composition of boards of directors. Why do I have fantastic metrics on that? Because you can count them. You can count the people. It's a finite problem. It's a little bit of legwork to do it, but you can count it and have very high confidence in the integrity of that analysis. I do care about the gender composition of boards. It's ridiculous, really mismatched compared to any subset of the general population, but why do I care about gender composition of boards? It's because they care about having healthy diversity at the decision-making levels of the organizations in which I'm investing. Well, gender composition of boards is really far from thinking about more multidimensional definitions of diversity. And that in turn is really far from thinking about the inclusion of that diversity, which is where you actually get the benefit of it being there in the first place.But I don't have metrics for those other things. I have metrics on the first thing. So that's what I'm going to code into my database. And that's what I'm gonna sort on when someone comes and asks us about our process. And for most people who are asking about process, that would be a big check plus on the report card and the folks who are willing and eager to have this more substantial conversation are relatively few. So it's an issue that comes up one situation after another. I'm constantly reminded of an early mentor of mine, Leslie Christian, who was a real pioneer in sustainable investing. And she is colleagues with Judy Wicks, who is a pioneer in sustainable business. Judy Wicks had this notion of a beautiful business. So this idea that she would wake up in the morning and she wanted to look around at her business and how it connected with its employees and its suppliers and its community and its customers, and see all these pieces coming together and know that this was a beautiful business and they could pay their bills at the end of the day, but that was one of many indicators.And Leslie had this idea that she wanted to have a beautiful portfolio where all the numbers were great, all the conventional metrics were great and also so much more. I've really kept that idea of beautiful portfolio in my mind, as we've gone forward into our work at Putnam. And I'm excited to be in a place literally an organizational place, but also a moment in time where there's at least some room to ask that bigger, more essential question, but it's uncomfortable. And it gets us right back into that kind of trade-off between risk and uncertainty like, okay, if your numbers are great, I'll let you ask these more open-ended creative questions, but if your numbers aren't great, I got no time for that. And you know, that's fair. I would say for where we are in the world right now, but it's a riddle that is not going to be solved by just adding more and more metrics that are proxies for much deeper, more interesting issues. We have to do that work for sure. But to mistake that for the finish, as opposed to the start is a really big problem. And when you have a system that is very focused on efficiency and kind of mechanization of processes, that problem is amplified.Michael Garfield (27m 54s): So to explore an angle on that, one of the things that in reading your book I just found myself constantly coming back to this because that particular road is very well trodden in my mind at this point, is the conversations that I had with Geoffrey West for this show and his sort of ringing the bell for the finite time singularity, which just for folks who haven't heard that episode, Geoffrey West is a physicist whose research on biophysical scaling, the scaling of distribution networks in the body, the circulatory and nervous system, et cetera, but then also took that work, he and his collaborators, into a study of cities as social reactors and how cities are this kind of ever accelerating ratcheting, social reactor that brings people into affiliation with one another and works in the way that you identify sort of one of these biomimicry virtues of connecting and finding new diversity in these recombinant relationships. Like you talk about plant pollinator relationships in the book, you know, with the mascot honeybee.The problem that West identifies is that this leads to a point at which the problems that we're creating, that we're innovating, not just wonderful new things, but horrible new things. And that the problems that we're creating are coming at us faster and faster. Because you've written this book that looks at across, you know, the short, the medium and the long-term. And I think that that really is in some respects, a core fluency in complex systems thinking is being able to stretch out to multiple time and horizons and kind of see them all in relationship to one another.I wanted to like bring up a couple of things that you talk about here. One is high-frequency trading and the flash crash of 2010. Go in, however you like into this forest here and hack your way through it for the rest of us, however you see fit. But the fact that there was high-frequency trading has led to a series of crashes that economic forensics still doesn't properly understand given all the time in the world, that we still don't quite know what happened back in 2010. A related problem is that the burden of information absorption on financial analysts is now so great.You mentioned the time it takes just to read reports has just gone through the roof. And so it's getting harder and harder to actually like see the forest for the trees, which is a related to a problem in the hyper specialization of scientific expertise. And the way that our credentials conferring systems in education are not changing as fast as the landscape itself. So like when you talk about risk and uncertainty, basically my question for you is it seems as though the world today is far less about risk, far more about uncertainty than it once was.And so given those examples, how do you think about this? What are the investment tools that you recognize work working best for a game in which are fundamentals of value are themselves changing? Is the mutual fund a horseshoe crab, like a stable strategy amidst a changing world, or is it like a stegosaurus that doesn't survive the proliferation of a new terrestrial ecosystem?Katherine Collins (31m 27s): That's a pretty vivid choice. Horseshoe crab or the stegosaurus either way. I wished for something a little more, I don't know what, so a few layers there that are really important. I think what you're alluding to within the field of finance and the different product forms and approaches to investing, it's the same set of questions that we see again in the organizations we're investing in.It's the same diagnosis when I look at a lot of other functions in the world as well. So one thing that has led to the high-frequency training element is, again, this idea that we're not always as creative as we think. So what did we do when we got some fancy new toys? We did the same thing we'd always done, but faster and more. There's no real reason for high-frequency trading, but there's sort of a opportunity available if you're a little bit faster than the other guy. And so why not go ahead?And that's true in a whole lot of different fields, the idea that the first wave of technology or new tools or development almost always is applied to doing the last thing faster or bigger, but not different. The next wave that comes usually is different. And so we've talked a little bit about some topics that are some days on the glass, half empty side of the ledger. For me, I think this bridges to the glass half full side, which is where are we now, one thing you can do with lots and lots of more speed in data conveyance and processing is to do the same thing you used to do, but faster and faster and faster and bigger and bigger and bigger, which is essentially the Geoffrey West model, but applied to trading, right?And it does exactly what you think. It gets faster and faster and more and more fragile at some point. And, you know, as we all know, doesn't always resolve itself in a really positive way, but the other path you can take, and this gets to, you know, when you look at Geoffrey's charts and there's the curves that are going up into the right and they're kind of exponential, but then another curve has to start, right? And that's the new thing that starting, which is much more interesting. So we could take those same capabilities and have started to at least in data recognition and processing and pattern finding and everything else and steer them at either different inputs or different intentions.And that gets really interesting. So when I think about all the different things I could use those same high-frequency tools for, what if I could use those high-frequency tools to actually assess, I don't know, employee wellbeing at a company that has millions of employees. There's probably a way to do that. We've got a few little clues about new tools that are underway to try to get closer to that. They're pretty modest at this point, but you can kind of see the potential there. That would be an additive and interesting and different insight as opposed to just price, price, price, faster, faster, faster.So we're starting to see some of those applications.  There's some new imagery from satellite technology that gets to a map of real-time methane emissions. So instead of waiting three years for the EPA to catch someone and find someone and then see it reported in the news. And then for me to follow up as an investor, you can just look and say, Hey, there's a leak here right now. It's in your best interest to stop the leak. You're losing money and you're frying the planet, let's fix it. So I think when I look at those curves of Geoffrey’s and we've talked about this many times, when I see that the near vertical part of any one curve, I start to feel awfully anxious.But when I see that new curve starting, that's where there's a lot of potential and we don't have to do just the same old things faster and faster, more and more desperately. We can choose to do something newer and better. And that's where I see a lot of amazing potential.Michael Garfield (35m 16s): Well, that brings me into the $64 million question, someone leading Putnam sustainable investing. You've got a great section in this book on balancing growth and development. And to again, invoke a circulatory system metaphor or a nervous system metaphor for the economy, it seems like a lot of the innovations that have been made in investment and in finance lately are at least at the edges of that, like among retail investors, it's like you already identified a realtime prices, but then there's also fee-free trading.And here we are, after GameStop and AMC, and you've got pundits saying, well, you know, that clearly was a bad idea. You mentioned in the book that people are trying to pump the brakes to protect investors. And that there's a tension there between access and between risk mitigation, which again has to do with sort of like the surface area of the margin of this thing, much more creativity, much more instability as we increase the surface area of the economy.And so, it would seem that to balance that growth, you need to increase the size of the aorta, which gets to thinking differently about redistribution. And it relates to a conversation that is stretched across episodes recorded with Brian Arthur and with Mark Ritchie of Syracuse University and Melanie Moses and others about what these scaling law models mean. At one point Ritchie’s model, for instance, the system is limited by productivity, and then it's limited by distribution, which it seems like a lot, at least in many areas like food is a good instance where we're wasting a lot of food because we're producing more than we're capable of distributing.You look at the amount of GDP growth over the last 30 years versus wage stagnation, et cetera, that looks like a distribution problem. And when I look at the natural world, it looks like the way that the elder systems we are listening to in this conversation have solved for this is by backing off a little bit is by making more room, that the 75% of ants that are doing nothing at any given time in a giant ant hill, Brian Arthur's advocacy for a universal basic income, but then there's like the other piece of it, which is you mentioned this in the book that we have to make sure that distribution is necessarily like centralization, that we're not just creating fragility.And then really the bigger piece of this is your comments about failing gracefully in this book. It seems the conversation is too simple, too one dimensional around endless economic growth or total collapse of civilization. And people are promoting a de-growth kind of rhetoric or thinking, but that also seems limited to these almost uselessly abstract and oversimplified ideas of value and the kinds of growth that are capable for us.So you speak a lot about realization in this and about the innovation of financial instruments that more closely match the kind of patterns that we see in reality in the non-human world, I should say. So I'm curious about your thinking about de-growth about the economic collapse, in what ways economic collapse might be surprisingly good, or at least offer opportunities for other kinds of growth that lead to a more resilient and ultimately beneficial kind of way of practicing economics.Katherine Collins (39m 10s): Well, that last part of your comment, I think, is key. So a few things that I do just to translate this maybe to daily practice, and then we can loop back to the bigger ideas because these ideas are on my mind day in and day out. And I think they are really relevant for long-term investors to consider it. This is not a separate conversation than deciding what stocks to buy and sell in my mind. This is the essential question for deciding what stocks to buy and sell in my mind.One thing we can do as investors, and again, SFI has taught me so much about this is ask a different question. Hopefully ask a better question or maybe a bigger question. And so to be fair, sometimes I get blank stares when I ask these questions, but I've been trying to get a little bit off script on purpose in our regular conversations with company management teams. So I will ask things for example, of a company that is essential in this accelerating access to creative forms of investing for folks who may not be experienced investors to ask the question to that group, instead of how much faster can you go, how much freer can you make it?What do you want to slow down? Where do you want to insert friction into your processes? That's a fun question. And it's not one that I think they get as often as the opposite question, to ask a company that is known for steady or significant revenue or cashflow growth over time, instead of saying, Hey, is it going to be 12% or 14%? Let's figure it out to ask the CEO, what dimensions of growth are most important to you? In what areas do you want to grow?So just broadening out the discussion, like, okay, it may or may not result in 30% earnings growth, but what do you have to grow within the company in order for anything else good to happen? And pretty often when you ask a question like that, you get answers like, oh, we really need to invest in our people. We have come up short on every possible target we've had for growing the capacity of our own team. And here's why that's harder than we thought. Here are the things we've learned along the way. Here's, what's possible if we are able to engage people who are really devoted to our mission and well-equipped to see it through here's. What's not going be possible if those people, aren't the first kind of foundation of our growth.So in some ways it's just connecting that bigger conversation. It's not instead of the traditional financial conversation, but it's trying to put that in its proper place, which is a pretty small place compared even to one organization, let alone to the broader economy. So I like asking those different questions. I think it gives you a chance, again, to start with this notion of re framing. Towards what end is not a bad question to keep coming back to, and if there's not a good answer for that sooner or later, the problems tend to accelerate in the way that you were describing.Michael Garfield (42m 16s): So again, to take the invitation that you're constantly making in this book and put things in context for goodness sake, don't trust general advice. Trust specific advice. So I'd like to reflect with you on what's going on right now in history, which is the reopening of much of the economy that has been closed over the last year due to the pandemic. And as you and I were discussing before the call, the way that this last year has by enforcing a slow-down, by putting the human economy on timeout, has had a lot of people sitting in the corner, reflecting on what they've done and the systems that they have sort of bought into without a lot of reflection, without time for that reflection.And as is the case with the personal dimensions of illness where it's like, okay, I can't be productive. I have to sit here and reflect on this. It obviously develop a much more rich and nuanced set of values or at least acknowledge values that they have that were not necessarily always behind the decisions that they were making. And so like, just as one example is that a lot of people just aren't going back to work, that they realized that family is more important or that their sanity is more important.And you know, this seems related to a piece that Sam Bowles and Wendy Carlin wrote together for Voxeu on the COVID-19 narrative. They're arguing that we've been thinking about things in terms of a balance of influence between the government and the markets. This is a very Sam and Wendy kind of statement. So much of human behavior is not motivated by state authority or by material incentives. It's not about obedience or about pricing and competition. It's about things like on their list, reciprocity, altruism, fairness, sustainability in group identity, social norms, the exercise of private power.This is the meso scopic scale of human organization, of community at neighborhood organization that made itself so obvious during the pandemic when mutual networks had to sprout up as a matter of necessity. And I'm curious how you see all of this playing out, like I've been tasked by David Krakauer to kind of go around SFI and ask people about the reopening and about what people expect from the next year or so, not what to do per se, but where the constraints are? How are people going to be seeing things in new ways?What are the meaningful new ways to consider all of this? And so, you know, again, it seems to always come back to how do we kind of model the unmodifiable, but I'd love to know yourthoughts.Katherine Collins (45m 10s): Few things are coming to mind. One is that my divinity studies in many ways are by far the most professionally relevant studies I've ever undertaken. I find that perhaps because they are non-traditional skills, at least within the realm of finance, they are more valuable than the things that kind of everyone has been trained in and everyone knows. And one of the big arcs of study that I undertook in divinity school was study of trauma and resilience and fragility and recovery kind of all bundled together.And a key lesson from that is that when you're in trauma, none of what you just mentioned is possible. It is true survival mode. There is no room for reflection and there shouldn't be. You need to kind of get to some level of health in order to have the capacity for reflection. And so the first thing I want to say is that I have been thinking through a lot of the same issues you just described in that, in and of itself as an incredible luxury. So to again, first kind of step back and put those questions into this bigger setting of the fact that such a huge proportion of humanity is still in that realm of trauma, I think is a pretty foundational recognition that can and should inform the direction for folks who are at the stage where reflection is possible and kind of making a different choice.So that's kind of the starting point in this setting. I'm thinking of after divinity school, I did that big Camino walk across Spain, the way of St. James. So it was 500 miles. I've never done anything that extended before. And I thought it was going to be this wonderful spiritual epiphany, tip toeing through the wild flowers for a couple of months, but it was hard. It was really, really hard. And sure enough, I found that I was deeply reflective the second day when the weather was perfect and I only had to walk 10 miles and it was pretty flat, but then I got these awful blisters and then I hurt my knee and there was no reflection whatsoever for like the next month.It was just one painful step after another. And then by the end, I was well enough that, I could have a little bit of space to kind of consider. So in a tiny, tiny inconsequential way, there's a lot of metaphor packed into that couple of months journey. So I think of it often when I'm trying to orient myself in the midst of the activities from this last year, but the questions you're asking I think are really essential ones. And they link back to what we were just saying about the insufficiency of some of our metrics as proxies for things that are deeper and more nuanced and may be more complete.So one thing that we don't have great metrics for either in the economy or in investing or in life, I think is this question of enough, what is enough-ness on any given dimension of life? We kind of can feel it a lot better than we can actually tangibly measure it in most cases. And again, this gets to a root that I think is so essential. We're talking about how endless growth is a challenge and the idea that there should be graceful post growth models for all sorts of things is really necessary.We probably need a different term for that, because even that term is so alienating. So growth 2.0 or growth in a different dimension as opposed to just, I'm going to keep going on this same path forever, but I kind of liken the economy to a person. You can gain 30 pounds because you're having a baby and it's awesome. You can gain 30 pounds because you ate a lot of pizza. It's not so awesome. And you know, the economy is the same way. The economy can grow in a way that is improving overall health and wellbeing and capacity of the whole, including the individuals within the whole, or it can grow in a way that is, you know, extractive and divisive.And the headline number is the same, but it's not the same implication at all. So this past year, I think for all of us has been a chance both personally and professionally to kind of step back and ask that essential question of why have I been on the path I've been on? Is it enough? Is it enough on all the dimensions that in some cases are newly illuminated to me? And if not, what might make sense from here? So these are big, big questions. And again, to me, it still comes back to this question of risk and uncertainty.The easiest course for many of us is to, I mean, there is just a pull back to like whatever used to be that is so strong because it's comfortable and it's knowable. And even if it's deeply flawed, you've been there before. And that is in many cases, a lot less daunting than something that might be infinitely better, but as new and not knowable a priori, I mean, it takes some courage to go in that new direction.Michael Garfield (50m 7s): There's a lot in there. Where do I even let me think about this? Okay. So another conversation that comes up a lot on this show is one that I had with David Krakauer about a year ago this week, probably that we're recording this when we were kind of cutting a conceptual trajectory through some of the SFI researchers contribute to an essay series on coronavirus pandemic, and Bill Miller had written one on high beta investment strategies. Miguel Fuentes had written one on the fragmentation of social graphs. Leading up to revolutions archeologically historically we talk about civilizations collapsing, but what they actually do in the words of interplanetary festival contributor, Annalee Newitz is scatter adapt.And remember, and so this was drawing on Tony Eagan's work about constitutional politics, that it would be great if we could come up with a kind of dynamic constitution that expands its regulatory influence, it's top-down influence in times where risk mitigation is preferable and then strips down to a fighting trim when it's time to emphasize agility and the ability to Dodge the ball from whichever direction.And we may not have the collective wisdom to actually design these kinds of systems, but they do seem like they're designing themselves, that there's an emergent quality that just to put one sort of last glass bead on this glass bead game metaphor string. I remember a SFI fellow Albert Kao coauthored some work that was led by UC Santa Barbara on how mass capture fishing is reducing the size of fish schools in the ocean. And there seemed like a real obvious analogy to the Exodus from the clear net that's going on, that that people are aware that they're being harvested by predatory surveillance capitalism.And so they're fleeing to platforms like discord, where they're trying to return to a more human scale and that that's also echoed and maybe a much more meaningful way in the real localization of economic behaviors. And you talk about how, even when people are locked out of various economic participation as investors in this larger arena, that we're starting to see a proliferation of new options for people to invest at the local level. I'm just curious whether you see a balance in the sort of top-down design of this kind of flexibility or whether it's all happening so fast that we're in that sort of trauma mode that you talked about, and we're just kind flinging stuff at the wall and seeing what works, which is not a bad thing, right. That's a mirror sanabilis is kind of stay home and thinkabout things.Katherine Collins (52m 60s): Well, there are a few elements that intertwine in your observations there. I think there's a really neat connection between the question of on what level do you want to organize? Like what scope and scale do you want to organize and the adaptability of whatever it is you're creating. In many cases, at least in the economic and financial world, the greater the scale, the lower the adaptability.I'm not sure if that's true as a universal statement, but it is for most corporate organizations. It is for most economies, I would say it is for a lot of governmental institutions and kind of big institutions more generally. So you're treating heft for nimbleness, which is not a bad trade-off, but I think you're framing this question as a design question is a really key element. Pretty often the things that were designed to be kind of cool, innovative, small, nimble things can grow quickly enough that there are big, giant dominant things.And there's a mismatch between the way that they've been designed and the function that they end up performing. So I think of a fairly long list of newer technologies that fall into this category where the technology inherently is actually pretty cool. It's just scaled all out of proportion to the underlying function that it was actually designed to perform. In some ways there are elements of the economy. There are certainly certain types of trading strategies that have the same issue. Something that's really neat when you're doing it with $10 million in your basement is not at all acceptable if you actually ended up influencing the entire global financial system. I talk with a lot of entrepreneur as part of my work. It's one of the most fun parts of the job is particularly talking with folks who are right on the edge of going from being in that startup phase to being kind of bigger, grown-up potentially public companies. Like that's not an easy or even a welcome transition for a lot of organizations. And so talking to the leaders about what is it that made you super cool and potentially disruptive, although it's not my favorite word when you were starting out and are those the same things that are going to make you awesome when you're a hundred times bigger or are those the things that are going to make you a menace and to really try to think ahead on that front, especially if you think you're going to grow tenfold this year and tenfold again next year, that's a real skill to have.So I think one of the challenges more broadly is that we often are taking questions or metrics or activities that are best suited at maybe a small and nimble and local level. And we're trying to cement them into these much bigger infrastructures. I'll give you an example from sustainable investing that is really top of mind for me right now and I think potentially existentially troubling. So we've got giant financial system, big power of money flow in the world, and a lot of positive potential if we can redirect investing towards more beneficial outcomes on all sorts of different dimensions, but what is the first thing we want to do?If we want to influence that system, we set up some standardized metrics and we sort things high to low. And we set a very clear kind of binary indicator for this is good. This is bad. This is acceptable. This is not, this is the threshold, above or below which we characterize your activity as worthy. That type of design description is almost a complete mismatch with the function that we're trying to perform. So if you are really trying to influence, for example, a transition to more renewable energy, the last thing you want to do is take a single backward looking point in time metric sort from high to low and divest from all the high numbers on that list.It leaves you with a bunch of stranded assets. It leaves the most problematic assets in the least capable hands for migrating them in an effective way. And it really distorts in the meantime, valuation for the up and coming solutions that need to be more affordable in order to take off. So you've got this really strong, well-thought through intentions and then a total mismatch of the metrics that go along with that intention. So I think this question of matching design with function is something that my biomimicry studies and my work with SFI over the years has really helped me to hone in on and my personal, I'll share it with the world.My little like nefarious Trojan horse is that every time I'm asked to comment on standards, whether it's regulatory standards or disclosure standards or something else, I just work in the words like appropriate or adaptable or evolving, like anything that I can get into the commentary that implies that this is a changing thing that is going to be iterative over time. It seems very small, but actually is gigantic when you look at the potential difference that an adaptive system could make, even on the simplest metrics in the world versus one that is frozen, but we like frozen.It gets back to that question of certainty. It's false certainty, but it doesn't matter that it's false. It's still certain in it. Many of us would choose false certainty over realMichael Garfield (58m 26s): Well, another shout out to Brian Arthur, because I'll be interviewing him soon about his recent essay on economics and nouns and verbs. That's sort of been lurking over this whole conversation about this argument that modeling everything in an algebraic equation means that you've specified all the variables and that's not what economies do. They're indogenous novelty generators. So thinking about it more in terms of a recipe, rather than a concrete prescription, I really appreciated how much attention you gave to design and form and function.And you know, this kind of approach. You make a statement on page 121 for people reading the hardcover resilience is about maintaining function in light of disturbance, not retaining form. And this rings when I hit the bell of the shift that's going on in conservation biology and ecology right now about what you elsewhere in this book described as a shift from preservation to renewal and attention to meaningful diversity, rather than the charismatic species that it's not about the panda.It's about what pandas do. And so in a weird way, you know, this opens us up into an inquiry, more suited to Harvard Divinity School, Katherine Collins, which is about, the questions that are left with us when we move into the 21st century, which is the century of complex systems science, and you've got papers coming out like the utter banger, "The information theory of individuality," which reframes our own identity as organisms in terms of the mutual information we exchange with our environments or with our own past and future states and brings us into something more like Alfred North Whitehead is process philosophy.You know, so when you start thinking about yourself and when you start thinking about economic instruments as strategies and your own funds that you create there, their values, like what comes up for you in this epistemic shift, from the known quantity, from the risk to the uncertain from the noun to the verb. You talk about making the shift from static to dynamic here and that's kind of where I'd like to end it, because that feels like an inspiring thing for all of us who are cast about, on the waves of change right now, and struggling, amidst the turbulence of this time where do you find inspiration as a private individual, as an investor, as a leader in the sort of phase transition that we're the ever more fluid identity that we now seem to have to inhabit.Katherine Collins (1h 1m 8s): Well, I don't think any of us having lived through this past year can legitimately cling to a true sense of control anymore. So one way or the other, we we've all felt put upon.  We've been forced to realize whether it's welcome or not that there are a whole lot of things in the world that we don't have a choice about in some ways and at some level. I think that the dark side of that experience is if you follow down that path too far, and without reflection, you start to feel like you have no choice about anything, and things are just going to be done to you and circumstances are going to arise.And that's a terrible kind of helpless feeling. One really important element of my studies in divinity school and really gets to the root of philosophy, ministry, religion, all of it is the notion of agency. And the idea that regardless of the circumstances, in, East of Eden, it's one of my favorite novels there's this word that is puzzled over for a really good chunk of the book called timshel. And there's this debate, you know, amongst all these different characters and scholars involved in the book, what does this word really mean?And that the debate is what the interpretation of this ancient word is. And in the end, the decision is that the word means though, mayest so it's this notion of free will that, regardless of the circumstances, there is this kernel of volition and agency that still remains, you know, how you respond to those circumstances still at some level, no matter how small is within your control. So that's kind of the extreme version, but this notion of agency, I think is the key to everything we've been talking about, which is inherently a little bit anxious at times, but full of potential.It's the key to all of that coming together in a positive way. So I try to kind of recenter on this question for my work, but really also my life, very simple question, but it's what can you uniquely add to this situation? And there's not always an obvious answer. Sometimes I'm more self-aware than other times, so you don't always know what you can uniquely add, but to be asking that question, instead of saying, what other people expect of me, what doors have been closed to me, how can I fit through, this really narrow recipe for success that's been put in front of me to flip that around and ask this more open-ended question of what could I do that would be truly additive that no one, but me could contribute to this ideally. I asked the same question of company CEOs, you know, when they meet with a lot of sustainability oriented investors, they go through this big, long report card, you know, a hundred pages long and 80 pages of it is irrelevant and 20 pages is highly critical. And by the end, they're just like, you know what ESG and I want to hear about it.  But if you flipped around that report card version and instead ask someone who's leading an organization, which by definition is unique compared to all other organizations in one way or another, what's the coolest thing you could do.Like you know your company better than anyone else your people, your products, your community, your customers, what is the most amazing thing that you could contribute to the world right now? I mean, that's a little out there for a question, that's a little bit Pollyannish, but oh my gosh, you'd be amazed at the answers you get. It's totally different than that report card kind of conversation. And I find that for a lot of us, our inner monologue is the report card monologue, points off for this points off for this. I'm not enough of this. I'm too much that, if you're not in that category, lucky you, but for a lot of us, there's sort of this inner report card that whether we're conscious of it or not we're comparing against, we flip that around and ask that question about potential like, oh my gosh, the things that would be possible.So that's what I see. Again it's a reason I keep showing up SFI one researcher after another, every time I meet someone, I'm like, oh my gosh, no one else could have done this research that you just did. Like you needed this combination of like people and ideas and background all to come together. And this is a piece of research I could not find anywhere else on the planet, that is additive. And, you know, may or may not get lots of external accolades for any one publication, but that is what the world needs. And so when we talk about things like inclusion, that's why it's important.It's not that I just want more people assembled. It's not just that I want more ideas. I want all of the additive qualities to come together. And so it links to the metrics we talked about and links to the systems we talked about. It links to all the challenges we talked about. The flip side of that challenge is that those ingredients are there. You just need to ask a different questionMichael Garfield (1h 5m 52s): That feels like a satisfying place to end this, Katherine, thank you so much for being on the show. That was really fun. Thank you. Thank you for listening. Complexities produced by the Santa Fe Institute, a nonprofit hub for complex systems science located in the high desert of New Mexico.

66,Episode Details / Transcript Tyler Marghetis  (0s): In saying that jazz is like an ecosystem that foregrounds the bi-directional non-linear relations between different componentsand makes hazier other aspects of jazz. That might also be interesting. But in both cases, you have this really interesting nesting of timescale. I think you were hinting at that a bit with your discussion of mass extinctions, where one thing that a mass extinction does is it resets the accumulation of timescales. It resets that lamination of deep history, moderate history, recent history, and all of a sudden you get these generalists becauseyou don't have these wonderful arroyos that have been laid out by the long history of the ecosystem.And you definitely do have that in jazz, even in free jazz. Tyler Marghetis  (51s): So yes, in freeJazz, they don't have a written out score that they're riffing on, but there is a long history of practice and norms that all of these players have internalized. You can't just get a bunch of random musicians together and be like play. There's a genre, there's a set of expectations. And those have a history. And what I think is really powerful about this ecological metaphor is it sheds light on those multiple timescales.Michael Garfield (1m 39s): When in ecosystem and economy, a jazz ensemble, or a lone scholar, thinking through a problem, critical transitions, breakdowns and breakthroughs appear to follow universal patterns. Creative leaps that take place in how mathematicians think out loud with body chalk and board look much like changes in the movement through music space, traced by groups of improvisers. Society itselfappears to have an aha momentwhen a meme goes viral or a new word emerges in the popular vocabulary, how to collectives at all scales be they neurons research groups or a society at large suddenly changed shape. And what early warning signs portend a pending bolt of inspiration. Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe.This week, we talked to SFI fellow Tyler Marghetis of UC Merced about regimes and ruptures across timescales from the frustration and creativity of mathematicians and musicians to the bursts of innovation, that appear to punctuate civilization and the biosphere alike. Speaking of creative bursts and breakthroughs, please, excuse us for getting this episode out weeks later than scheduled. My second child came sooner than expected last month and our communications office has been busy dealing with knock on effects.Michael Garfield (3m 17s): Ifyou value them research and communications efforts, please subscribe to Complexity podcast or wherever you prefer to listen, rate and reviewus @applepodcasts and/or consider making a donation at santafe.edu/podcast. Give you can find numerous other ways to engage with us at Santafe.edu/engage. Thank you for listening. Tyler, welcome to Complexity podcast. I think I've been chasing you for what, two years now or something like that. Tyler Marghetis  (3m 53s): Yeah. And Ihaven't been running away. It's felt more like a dance than the chase, so I'm very happy to behere.Michael Garfield (3m 57s): Fair. Yes, actually, that's funny because you know, that's one of those Lakoff and Johnson metaphors we live by, you know, is love war. Is love a dance, the journey. It's a journey. So we're on a journey together. And I think, you know, consequently, this journey will be one in which I'm constantly exposing my own implicit cognitive biases just in the way that I speak and gesture through our conversation. And so for anyone who can't see, my hands are doing this and Tyler's hands are down here. All right. Well, anyway, the first one I want to talk with you about was a piece that you presented on briefly in last year's working group on complex structures in musicology that this piece on creative leaps in musical ecosystems, early warning signals of critical transitions and professional jazz, which honestly is kind of like a drinking bingo victory for me with like all of the possible, you know, like how did you manage to fit all of this interesting stuff into one, one paper?This is a Matt Setzler and Minje Kim that you wrote this with. We need to loop back and give people a little bit of biographical stuff so that people can get a sense for who you are and how you became a complex systems researcher and ended up at SFI. And why it is that you're animated to study the kinds of things that you're studying here.So yeah, a little bit of backstory, please. Tyler Marghetis  (5m 47s): It's been a circuitous route. I was not an early acolyte, althoughmaybe sort of an early fan boy of complex systems and the Santa Fe Institute, you know, in my earliest days, most of my time was taken up with sport. I was a competitive gymnast as a youngkid and then fell in love with Olympic style wrestling. And that consumedmy life really from my early teens into my twenties and was also a gateway for me to see the world. I was the alternate for the Olympics, traveled all over the world, representing Canada, I'm from Montreal, Canada, and just had a fantastic time pursuingthis strange form of excellence which is friendly combat. And as I was wrapping up that particular journeyand trying to figure out what I want to do next, I had this inflection point where I had to decide I was retiring at the ripe old age of 25 niece or ears malformed from years of wrestling what comes next. And a couple of things were happening at that 0.1,Tyler Marghetis  (6m 44s): I was moving away from sport andreally wanted to finally try to make a go at it as a scientist. I'd always dreamed of being a scientist, but you know, just. I didn't have scientific role models in my life. It really felt like a stretch. The other thingthat happened was, you know, in my mid twenties, I realized I was gay and had to go from dating women to sort of inhabiting this whole new social identity. So I experienced a number of like pretty severe ruptures of social, sexual identity. I came out to my family, oh my God. And then my professional identity basically a pro athlete, it was funded by the Canadian government to some kind of scientists. I didn't quite know what kind of scientists to become next. And then I discovered cognitive science, which for mebrought together all these different things. I was interested in;The brain language, culture interaction, and thiskind of beautiful systems, complex systems, the perspective on all of those in one of research practice. And so that brought me from Montreal, Canada, to San Diego, California, all the way across the continent to do my PhD in cognitive science. And while I was doing that, I always had my eye on this world of complexity science of complex systems, because that was really the perspective that I felt fit most naturally with my own intellectual inclinations. And so after getting fully certified as a doctor of cognitive science, it was really a dream toend up here at the Santa Fe Institute where I could finally let my complex systems freak flagfly, and didn't have to pretend that I was just your run of the mill cognitive scientists interestedin individual psychology. I could be completely transparent about the fact that the issues that animated me were really issues that go beyond the individual that even go beyond the human and are really questions about complex human social systems more generally. And that's been my joy since being here.  Michael Garfield: It seems like a lot of people come out of the closet as interdisciplinary transdisciplinary. That kind of thing. Tyler Marghetis  (8m 54s): And it's arelief and you see bodies relaxing the same way that in my own experience of coming out as queer, you know, all of a sudden I slept better. I feel like Iwas taller. You don't get your whole embodimentchanges. And you see scientists come in this sort of slinking into the Santa Fe Institute. And they were like, well, I guess I'm a physicist, but really I'm or, you know, I officially am a sociologist, but really I'mand they finally just have that freedom to be themselves.  Michael Garfield: It was funny. I was on the other end of the spectrum. I was just talking to a friend who is considering quitting her PhD program at a rather esteemed university because she came into it with a real clear, strong sense of how freaky she was and how big the questions she had really are. And that she's been suffering and she acknowledges must be some kind of psychosomatic stress-related chronic disorder now two years into her PhD.And she's like, I think I have to quit in order to get my health back. So, I mean, clearly this is not what I expected to talk about today, but I do think that in so far as your work explores the relationship between the way that we think about things, the way we talk about things, the way we enact them in our environments, in our bodies, I suspect we're going to keep bumping into this fundamental relationship, or perhaps even kind of like non-duality, if I may, between the way that we are in our heads and the way that we're allowed to express ourselves in the effects that has on the way that we relate to one another.So now that you wrestle ideas instead of people, why don't we wrestle this piece on jazz and on the application of an ecosystemic metaphor to what's going on in jazz and the kind of collective cognitive activity that we see on display in improvisational ensembles. So talk a little bit about the inspiration for this piece and why throughout this piece, you continue to articulate these questions in a way that makes it seem like you're pushing a kind of daring proposal, which is that this analogy actually holds, and that it's not as ridiculous as it may seem to some people. Tyler Marghetis  (11m 21s): First of all, the inspiration is that I like doing science with friends and Matt Setzler my co-author of that paper as a buddy and a wonderful cognitive scientist, as well as a wonderful composer and jazz saxophonist. So that's part of the motivation, but really the bigger motivation is that I have a couple recurring puzzles mysteries that I sort of carry with me throughout my research. And those include things like, why did we get stuck in ruts in our thinking and our activity?How do we break out of those? And also as you've been hinting at, what's the role of the body sort of our fleshiness in those ruts and those ruptures. So that's why a lot of my early work was on mathematics because that's a place where people get really stuck in their ways. And then all of a sudden someone has a breakthrough. There's a new proof and they radically reconfigure their understanding. And those issues really show up in a fun way and improvise jazz on this wonderful short timescale that makes it much easier to study.So in free improvised jazz, there isn't a notated score that is brought into the performance. Most of the playing emerges spontaneously out of what the musicians are doing with each other. They're riffing off each other. They're in conversation, they're coupled, they're decoupled. And out of that initial cacophony, you get sometimes really interesting sounds. And those sounds stick around for awhile. They become entrenched maybe for a minute, two minutes, three minutes, they settle into a rut or another word that I use as they sit onto a regime or a sound world.And then suddenly seemingly out of nowhere, they completely reconfigure what they're doing and they end up somewhere else. And so for me, this was like a prototypical example of this recurring tension that I see throughout the human experience between these really, really stable ruts or regimes that we get into. And these moments of sudden radical reconfiguration. And so jazz was the perfect case study and also a heck of a lot of fun because jazz musicians in general are just more fun to study than video of mathematicians working on proofs at a Blackboard.I love mathematicians, but video data of mathematicians, less exciting than smokey basement jazz club video.Michael Garfield (13m 49s): So, yeah, so reading this paper for me looming over my reading of this paper was the conversation I had recently with Deborah Gordon at Stanford, who studies distributed computation and ant colonies. And she makes the point that contrary to the way that we were thinking about ants, maybe a few decades ago, it's very much like a jazz ensemble, that the roles are mutable, that there is no score in that we were bringing this kind of managerial mindset or a classical symphonic mindset to the study of these systems that figure things out in a very ad hoc kind of way.And consequently it's like, yeah, there's no manager like the queen is not telling people what to do. I do want to circle back to the question of jazz and that particular mode of distributed cognition and its relationship to these other kinds and like the ecological influence that lead to one strategy over another strategy. Because what we regard as improvisation might be kind of the same thing that we're seeing going on with composition, but at a different timescale or spatial scale, but that's all sort of a meta on this paper.And we have a responsibility to actually talk about this before we leap into that. So it seems like the place to start here would be in the precedent set by people like SFI, external professor Marten Scheffer talking about what is actually going on at these thresholds or these transitional moments and how it is that we can identify the features that we can look for to anticipate them. So like setting a little bit of laying out some of the core concepts there and then how you and your co-authors sought to identify the features in the music that you were examining that would allow you to kind of quantify all of this.Tyler Marghetis  (15m 48s): So Marten Scheffer is an ecologist and he, along with a number of different ecologists have been trying to identify generic early warning signals that an ecosystem is about to undergo some kind of critical transition. So you can imagine a lake that goes from a really healthy, thriving, clear watered state to one where all the fish die off and you get a sudden catastrophic algebra bloom.Can we know that that's about to happen and what those really clever ecologists have done is taken some technical tools that were originally introduced in statistical mechanics, sort of physics broadly looking at when we can predict phase transitions. And the idea is that when a system is perched on the edge of one of these transitions, it's lost resilience in some way. And one way that you can test for that is you can poke the system.So imagine the lake example. You go in, and maybe you kill off a bunch of the fish, or you add a whole bunch more and you see how rapidly the system is able to bounce back to return to its healthy, happy functioning state. And if you sort of measure that return time, the time it takes for the system to bounce back after you poke it, that gives you a good sense of how resilient the system is. You want it to sort of really rapidly be like, okay, you poked me, but I'm back.I'm back to usual. A lot of systems that we want to study, we don't have the ability to go in practically and poke them. It would be irresponsible to poke a lot of like big, healthy functioning ecosystems. And so what you can do instead is you just let the system sort of work on its own. It's just sort of like living out its life. And you look at the noise structure of the system. As it bounces up and down, just on the basis of natural noise in the system, there are, it turns out some recurring measures that you can calculate that tell you how resilient the system is.So you can look at auto correlation or variants or flickering. These are sort of technical terms for different calculations you can do that can give you an idea of how quickly the system forgets these pokes, these prods and returns to its natural resting state. Now, my idea was that these measures of resilience might work just as well in the quote ecosystem of jazz improvisation. So really drawing on those ecosystem metaphor when really that's sort of a way of speaking. What I want to say there is that in jazz improvisation, you have multiple elements that are interacting with each other in a distributed way.And I could have called that an ecosystem or an economy, or just flat out called it a complex system. But the idea is that in these kinds of systems where you have distributed elements interacting in nonlinear ways, you can sometimes foresee this loss of resilience that precedes a sudden catastrophic, critical transition. And so we set out to try to use the tools that had been deployed so well by folks like Marten Scheffer and others for natural ecosystems to see if they would work just as well for this human social, cultural, technical, jazz ecosystem.Michael Garfield (19m 11s): Now, if I'm understanding this correctly, one of the main differences between this sort of experimental poking of a forest or whatever, and what you're describing here is the difference between exogenous and endogenous disruption. So in a way that strikes me, this is more similar to say a model of technological innovation, where it has to do with the relationships between the members of the ensemble, rather than say a heckler in the audience.And although there are great videos of Jacob Collier are responding to people whose phone goes off during a concert or whatever, incorporates it into the play. And he manages to just stay on the rail while acknowledging that that's happened in a really clever way. So I would like to talk a little bit more about the two factors that you're looking at here ,increased variability and lagged auto correlation. So this is a whole lot clearer to me looking at the figures in this paper where you've managed to put this musical data through a series of transforms so that you can kind of see the four members of this jazz ensemble and see in a really stripped down low dimensional way of kind of how they're relating to one another.But yeah, unpack that a little. Tyler Marghetis  (20m 31s): I mean, so the tactic we took was to transform the music they were producing into a trajectory through this high dimensional space of sound. So now instead of just having audio that we're dealing with, we've transformed the performance into kind of like a journey through space. So they start off in one corner, they may be bounced around there for a bit. And then by the end of the performance, they might be an entirely different corner of this high dimensional. We can imagine just picture a room, right?So the walk in by the door, they're hanging out by the door a bit, then they go over to the corner, they're sitting on the couch and by they I mean the sound they're producing. Once we've done that, all of a sudden we have a whole bunch of mathematical tools because instead of just a bunch of sounds that were sort of subjectively appreciating, we have a trajectory, a mathematical expression of what they're doing. And the idea with increased variability like autocorrelation is that you can look at how that trajectory through musical space is behaving and whether it's highly staple.So very low variability, they're basically just doing something very, very similar over and over again, or highly variable. So even though they might be staying in the same region of sound space, they're actually more and more sort of diving out and then coming back. They're playing something that sounds really different. And then returning to the thing they were doing before. And then that mathematically, it looks like increased variability in this trajectory, through the sound space.Michael Garfield (22m 7s): And it strikes me that that's at least geometrically similar to what you see again in like ant foraging, how the loop out exploring for new resources and then somebody will find something and then the whole nest sort of changes direction at that point, all the other ants follow and having organized a group improvisational exercises in my past life in Austin, you feel that you can tell people are getting kind of bored and then they start testing things and then everyone notices and latches on to something.But it's curious because in this piece, you kind of suggest that we don't expect to observe this kind of thing in composed scripted music. And yet when we look at like the harmonic structure, as we move through a piece of music be at classical, this whole build and release, something becoming more and more dissonant before it kind of condenses into a new form or an electronic dance music, there's the buildup and the drop. And so I'm curious if those seem substantively different to you than what you're observing in the ensemble, or it's not merely a structure that we observe in kind of like real-time improvisational collaboration, but it has something to do with like the way that we process information and the way that we organize narrative structure and the way that we move through various spaces at whatever timescale.Tyler Marghetis  (23m 47s): And so I think in the compose case, you're completely right that compose music is playing off a set of expectations of cognitive responses that we're likely to have so far as we may have evolvedto be sensitive to this kind of loss of resilience in a system before an exciting, critical transition. It's entirelypossible that composers, maybe even unconsciously have been building inthese kinds of signals into their music as a way of communicating to the listenerthat something is about to approach. On the other hand, I don't think we would see the same kind of loss of resilience and compose music that we see in jazz at the micro structural level, which is reallywhere we see it with jazz. We see it breaking down on the millisecond to millisecond level where all of a sudden what's happening in the present moment is much more tied to what they were doing a secondago. This is lagged autocorrelation, this is memory. So the system is building up a memory, what it was doing before it's taking longer and longer return to its happy spot, right? It's the sort of that natural attractor. And I don't think we would see that with composed.But I want to circle back to your point about the ant going out and exploring, because I think that's also really interesting and there, a lot of folks woulddescribe that as a trade-off between explore and exploit. So a lot of systems engage in and by systems, I mean, say like a foraginganimal will find a patch of food and then it's, you know, chowing down. It's a buffet, it's super happy, but it needs to make a decision. How long does it stay there? As the food begins to run out. When's the optimal moment to be like, okay,yeah, this is great, but I'm running out soon. I should probably find the next berry bush or whatever. So when it'shanging out and just eating, that's the exploit phase, it's exploiting the food and then the explore phase. And when it goes out,which is costly right there, I have to move through space. There's a metabolic cost. That's beenstudied a lot by biologists and ecologists,whether foraging actually lives up to the optimal trade-off between exploiting a food source and exploring for a new one, we can ask whether musicians do the same thing or storytellers or mathematicians. There was a similar trade off that the ant colony needs to make between exploiting where it is right there right there, sort of thesecollective free jazz musicians, really riffing on a particular sound world and be like, this is fun. And then deciding, okay, when is it not paying the same dividends that it was before? When should I begin to explore some other region of the sound space? When should the little ant go out and start exploring somewhereelse? And you brought up boredom, which I think is something that's really interesting about human social systems that you don't necessarily have with natural ecosystems. So in a natural ecosystem that can exhibit these kinds of critical transitions, this critical slowing down, which is what you see before with this loss of resilience. You don't have individual fish who are like, okay, we've been in this particular ecosystem, stable state, we've been in this basin of attraction. I'm bored.I really want something exciting. I would love like a mass die off and a bloom of it. Like that sounds way more fun. That doesn't happen. You don't have individual that have a Metta image of the entire system and goals and aspirations for that system. Should do you do have that with jazz musicians where the individualisn't just sort of riffing on its own and unthinkingly coupling withthe other players, they have a vision. And if the system has been stabilized in area for too long, they can get bored because they're interested in more than just maintaining their local dynamics in some sort of stable way. They're also trying to impress an audience. They're also trying to be interesting. And that's what makeshuman social complex systems so interesting is that you often have these local representationswithin the individual, within a book, within a play of the collective of the society of the performance andthat sort of multi-scale structure where the local partsend up representing what they aspire the whole system to do is something that I think is really unique to human social systems.  Michael Garfield: Oh, good. We just walked right up the ladder to the sort of meta that I wanted to ask. So, you know, thinking about jazz as a strategy, this was one of our undergraduate researchers with Abby about she wants to study a music project and I was suggesting looking into the composition and improvisation and kind of an evolutionary dynamics thing. So in so far as any anatomy or technology is an adaptation, is it response to a given environment and therefore kind of a hypothesis or embodied model of the world, right? Jazz is saying something about the world that it merged into or emerged through.And certainly, many people have said very eloquently that jazz, as we understand it in the United States emerged as a response to the trauma of the world wars and a challenge presented by industrialized warfare to the model of the world that we had, the linear narrative of the progress of modernity. And so when we talked with Laurence Gonzales on the show about his book, Surviving Survivaland on trauma, the relationship between trauma and creativity, the fact that jazz musicians are playing off a score and are responding at this whole other timescale to these minute variations in the environment, seems like it's symptomatic of the fact that we had to throw the script away, that suddenly Wagner looks like a Nazi, that like he was, but like when I spoke with David Krakauer about mass extinctions and market crashes in episode 29, and we talked about how a high beta trading strategy, this more like exploratory mode of investing and how that's related to in mass extinctions, you see this mature ecosystem with like dinosaurs and other megafauna, you know, very narrowly specified symbiotic relationships.And then all of that comes crashing down. And what survives are generalists that are actually horribly inefficient in one of those systems that you in a mature ecosystem, be it ecological or cultural, you find a lot of specialists, but then as the unpredictability of the environment goes up and up and up, then suddenly that inefficiency pays off. So it's specifically like free jazz is like this very narrow subset of jazz and you address that in this paper.But, you know, I just curious what you think about all that, because I'm inclined to push for an even deeper embrace of this analogy than you seem to in the paper. And like in particular, the way that you just said, as you say in this paper that one difference between humans and nature, as we're talking about them here is that we don't have these centralized transitions in nature. And yet here we are in the Anthropocene where you have mega billionaires that are capable of like leaving an impact on the geological record.And that's like the ultimate invasive species. And like, it does seem to blend together for me in a different way.  Tyler Marghetis : I won't argue with you about that. I mean, I think there are a ton of really productive analogies between these. I do think it's funnyto look at the history of everyone's favorite analogy. There's been a bit of a discussion within the Institute over the last week about this recurringphrase, you know, everything has a blank. This was a meme that was contrastingAaron Clauset, which external faculty at SFI with Cris Moore, faculty and residents. And I think Cris Moore was saying nothing is a network. And Aaron was saying everything is a network or vice versa.Tyler Marghetis  (31m 45s): And that prompted this fun internal reflection about as long history of everything asa blank statement. And so therewas a period where people were saying, you know, everything has an ecosystem. And I think I'm part of that tradition in saying that, you know, a jazzensemble is an ecosystem, but prior to that, there was everything is an economy and who knows what the next metaphor is going to be. And so if I resist sort of a too strong identification between jazz and natural ecosystems, it's only because I recognize that our favorite modelsystem is going to change. And like with anymetaphor, certain things become clearer and other things become cloudier. And so in saying that jazz is like an ecosystem or is an ecosystem that foregrounds the bi-directionalnonlinear relations between different components and probably makes hazier other aspects of jazz. That might also be interesting, but you're right. That in bothcases you have this really interesting nesting of timescale. I think you were hinting at that a bit with your discussion of mass extinctions, where one thing that a mass extinction does is it resets the accumulation of timescales. It resets that lamination of deep history, moderate history, recent history, and all of a sudden you get, you know, these generalists because you don't havethese wonderful, arroyos these wonderful river beds that have been laid out by the long history ofthe ecosystem. And you definitely do have that in jazz, even in free jazz. So yes, in free jazz,they don't have a written out score that they're riffing on,but there is a long history of practice and norms that all of these players have internalized. You can't just geta a bunch of random musicians together and be like play. There's a genre, there's a set of expectations and those have a history.and what I think is reallypowerful about this ecological metaphor is it sheds light on those multiple timescales.So we have the micro timescale of the saxophonist picking up on smalllittle variations in how the drummer is playing. Then you have like a miso timescale of the hopes and aspirations of these players for what they want to do withina piece. And then with that a gig, and then also a lifetime of training, and then also a cultural historical timescale of how those drums developed. And in that paper, we really focus on the micro time scale. But I think there's a really interesting story to be told about similar critical transitions in aesthetic regimes over the long historical timescale of music. And what really excites me is a finding generic mechanisms that apply equally to the micro timescale of the millisecond to millisecond variation in play, as wellas to the longer socio-historical timescale as you said, this sudden visceral response to the horrors of the world wars that gave rise to something like jazz, which itself is like a critical transition in the history of music, but on a very different scale.  Michael Garfield: So this is great because now we're getting into a conversation I've been, I guess, prosecuting on social media, which is about this phrase, the death of the genre. If I call back to the conversation I had with Geoffrey West and 35 and 36, and you know, this ominous graph that he draws of the finite time singularity where, innovation precipitates, it's a crisis that is then solved by innovation, which resets the crisis clock.But now the clock is moving faster and we just keep doing this over and over in this like super exponential curve of delayed disaster. And this is, you know, much like Simon Levin, just co-authored a piece in PNASon using evolutionary models for financial markets. And they were talking about a very similar thing in innovation and finance, where we now have these high-frequency trading algorithms and the flash crashes that they induce, things are moving at such a pace that it sort of defeats our ability to even adequately model them, which sounds a lot to me like what people are getting at when they say the pace of recombinant change now in a global musical context, where everyone is exposed to everything and it's remixing constantly doesn't afford the kind of subcultural insulation that allows for stable genre categories.And it looks more like horizontal gene transfer among bacteria than it does the kind of stable you carry euchariotic inheritance of Darwinian evolution as kind of commonly conceived. So I guess what I'm getting at is like, it seems like to some degree free jazz has been released into the water supply. And I'm curious where you might push against that or to what extent you think that that holds that. We're kind of at a point now where in spite of the fact that yes, free jazz is a genre that the notion of genre now has to be bounded or constrained or contextualized in a certain way to even mean something.And you know what that means in terms of the fact that we're actually inside one of these critical transitions that your paper models that the critical slowdown is happening all around us.  Tyler Marghetis: I am not a historian of music. And so I will speak softly, but two things, one, all of the examples you just gave or of catastrophic negative transitions. And I think it's important to remember that often these critical transitions are beautiful and transformative and elevating.So think of a great artistic breakthroughthat suddenly leads to a period of great productivity or, you know, a mathematical insight or two people falling in love. These are all examples of critical transitions that are really quite fantastic. And I think on the surface can be modeled in really similar ways to Geoffrey West's singularity, these kinds of horrific market disasters. But I think it's important to remember that they're all so are really fantastic, beautiful, criticaltransitions. Michael Garfield: Honestly, I don't mind the death of the genre. It means that we get know as long as we have algorithms to recommend me music. So I don't have to try to like figure out in a record store where to go for what I want now. It's like, there's more excellent music now than there ever was.  Tyler Marghetis : The other thing I'll say is that in a jazz performance, you don't have pieces that lasts two seconds and you don't have pieces that last for days, theyseem to fall within this range of two to 40 minutes. You know, if you're really sort of riffing hard. Likewise with things like genres or other cultural objects, the brand, the scaleof those objects emerges from the culturaland that can change. And so when we talk about the death of genre, I think we're actually talking about a change in natural scale. The scale of the cultural system has changedso that the right way, of course, graining people's cultural productivity is no longer the scale that we're used to from our younger years where we sort of had an expectation about the right way to slice up cultural space.I think it's changed. I don't think there areno longer naturally emergent divisions, aesthetic preferences, clusters of interest. Thosestill are there absolutely there just on a slightly different scale than we're used to. And, that's a little uncomfortable because we're used to knowing the rightscale to look at, to pick out the genrehas changed. And I think that's fun. And I think my betis that if you jumped in your cryogenicfreeze and machine froze yourself, came back in a hundred years, people are still gonna be talking about genres, but they're just going to be on a scale that's unrecognizable to you, or to me, I think we're in that process of shifting temporality of shifting scaleat which we experienceproduce and sort of classify artistic products generally, but especially in music.  Michael Garfield: That really strikes me as a kin to the work that David Krakauer did on the evolution of syntax back in the day and that, like, if we are looking at this recombinant creative explosion, it's in response to gear shift here. I guess shifting the relevant scale that looks a lot like the shift from trying to remember every word that humans have to remembering a few rules and a few words, and like knowing how to put them together in a more interesting way.And then at that point we can specialize because then your group over there can have words that I don't need and so on. But then again, like at that point who's doing the sorting and we cannot expect anyone to actually know all of the different, highly granular genres that were created by the downward causal pressure or whatever of this new domain. Anyway, I don't know that could be word salad. We're at a pretty good point where we can get into this other paper, which we're only going to do the two.Michael Garfield (41m 13s): So this one you led with Kate Sampson, Dave Landy, the complex system of mathematical creativity, modularity bursting times, and the network structure of how experts use inscriptions and this rhymes in an interesting way, the jazz piece because you're looking at how people are thinking out loud. Or rather, like in a visual way, the equations on a chalkboard you're coding and examining video, but this is largely about zooming out from the jazz ensemble that might be going on in someone's brain. And then looking at it, how that creates a network of symbols on a blackboard and then how that person's writing and attention moves around in that network. Maybe I've just spoiled the whole thing.  Tyler Marghetis : There's the punch line. I will say in a fundamental way, this hearkens back to the comment that you made at the top about the role of our bodies in thought, and that's been a real through line of a lot of my work dating back to my PhD days, which is that even if you look at the most rarefied abstract forms of human reflection, you find that the body is there front and center, and thisis especially true in mathematics. The received vision that we have of mathematics is that it's pure rationality detached from our fleshy emotional bodies. Who do we think of when we think of, you know, thesort of outer reaches of mathematical reasoning, it's like Stephen Hawking,a person who in many ways did not have access to his body as a tool for thought. And sothe fact that that is a political image of mathematical reasoning says something aboutour received cultural pictures of how math works. But if you actuallygo out and look at how math done, it turns out it is par exellence, an example of manual labor, right? It's themost manual of all the labors years ago, I sawthis ad for a government retraining program and it said something like in the future, there will be no manual labor, but the picture was of a computer programming typing with his hands. Let's not forget whatmanual labor means. It means working with your hands.Michael Garfield (43m 43s): And there's sucha cultural judgment associated with the, using our bodies for labor in general. We value white collar workers who don't sweat, who don't use their bodies in our cultural videos. Sothat's sort of the cultural image. And so we forget that, you know, whenever we're doing something we're doing with our bodies, right. We're biological organisms and that's true, no less of mathematics. What does math look like? It almost never looks like Stephen Hawking sitting in isolation in his chair. It looks like often a small group of people scribbling away at a blackboard or whiteboard or here at the Institute on our windows with markers. And we're being our usual fleshy mammalian selves. And even the case of Stephen Hawking, there's this wonderful ethnography of Stephen Hawking by the sociologist Helene Mialet who looks at how has he been Hawking is able to do at all. And it turns out he does it by relying on the bodies of other people, of his students. So Stephen Hawking would recruit a new student every year and would give them these short commands that would guide how they should scribble draw diagrams, write equations on the blackboard. And he would sit back and inspect what they were doing. So he didn't have access to his own body due to mathematics. So he had to recruit the body of another. So that realization that our bodies are core part of even the most abstract thought, even the most arcane regions of mathematical reasoning has really a lot of my work. And a lot of my research has trying to quantify what exactly our bodies are doing in this quote unquote abstract realm of thought. And that's what we're trying to do in this paper. We're trying to use the tools of complexity science to quantify the use of people's bodies as they were working on fairly tricky proofs. These were math experts. You know, most of them were finishing up a PhD or on their route to a PhD in mathematics. And again, adopting this ecological metaphor, we were trying to figure out what within the natural ecosystem of mathematical reasoning, which is one or more bodies out of blackboard where they're scribblingand erasing and pointingand looking and talking and doing all the things that are part of the canonical mathematical situation. Michael Garfield: So the thinking in space, right? That's a big piece, actually. There's several of your other papers get at this and your work with Nunez, right? Like you did your PhD study, Where Mathematics Comes From, really interesting, cool book. If folks want to dig more deeply into that, but like, you know, for, for the sake of time, like let's focus on how you and your coach analyzed the way that people were writing out their thoughts in the two dimensional space of a blackboard, his dad has networks in order to formalize it.And then the patterns that you found in those networks, because that, I think gives us a place to anchor this piece back into the first half of this conversation and talk about the flights of the imagination. Tyler Marghetis  (47m 14s): And so the methodological tactic we adopted here was a focus oninscriptions being put on a blackboardand to treat each new inscription,whether that's an equation or a as one node in a larger network of inscriptions. And so the vision we had was that when people start working on a problem, you know, they might just write out the statement of the problem. That's one note, and then they think, okay, maybe I'll draw a picture, drawing a picture, always a good idea. When you're trying to solve a problem,a little diagram, that's another note. Then they can look back and forth between those and that act of shifting your attention between those two nodes. That's the edge. And so what we could do is look at a dynamically updated network that was changing over time. It was gradually accumulating, more and more nodes as people were introducing more and more inscriptions to their quote ecosystem of thought. And what this allowed us to do is to step back from whenever they're thinking, which we can't see inside their skulls. We don't have a cognito scope that allows us to extract their thoughts. And instead to focus on, as I said before, the manual labor of mathematics and this wonderful dynamic structure that they're creating in front of them that seems to be really important because we all do it when we're doing math. We fill up whiteboards or blackboards or windows with inscriptions. We want to see what does that actually look like? What's the structure there? And so we were able for all of these different mathematical experts, working on these problems to build for each of them, a network representation of how they'd gone about solving the problem, and then ask questions about the structure of those networks and the dynamics of people's attention as they're shifting their interaction from one diagram to a different equation, to another word, to another diagram within this network representation.And really the metaphor that I had in mind was of niche construction, the way that some organisms transform their worlds, spiders, building webs, animals, building dams, to completely transform the local terrain and to think about mathematicians as people who engage in this kind of cognitive niche construction, changing the terrain of thought so that some insights become easier and others become more difficult.And looking at those notations as the mathematical equivalent of the spider web or the dam that's being created by the organism to changetheir niche.  Michael Garfield: Well, I mean, certainly, you know, it, it calls to mind that hilarious fictional video, or it's rather a, a kind of a remix fictionalized remix of the old video of we gave all these different drugs to spiders and here are the effects. I'm sure many of the listeners to this podcast have seen that excellent Quantaarticle from a few years back about the web as a cognitive extension of the spider's own brain.And so I don't feel like you're making a huge analogical leap here at all.  Michael Garfield (50m 27s): I mean, from, from orbit, everything looks really close. So from that aerial view, two interesting patterns emerge here that you figure in this paper and they're characterized by what I recognize actually as musical terms, clusters, which again, a shout out to the musicology and complexity working group. You think about tone clusters and just kind of mashing your hand on the keyboard. Everything's really close versus loops where things are a little bit more spread out and that's sort of orthogonal, unless you're like Dimitri Tymoczko and you're actually mapping this stuff on a circular object.But one network is really sort of dense and a one network has these sort of long linear arcs in it. And yet these are two different approaches to solving the same problem. And I'm curious what that says to you about the way that different people solve these problems. And then also how it might relate to a talk to a link to in the show notes that Simon DeDeo I gave last year on explosive proofs of mathematical truths, where he's talking about not these solving of an equation per se, but the formulation of a mathematical proof and how rather than it being this linear thing, you can actually represent them as networks.And then you can knock pieces of that proof out. And the whole proof still holds. Whether you think that viewing this solving of a mathematical problem in this way, whether certain approaches are more or less brittle to disruption in the way that the day I was talking about certain paths to reprove being more robust.Tyler Marghetis  (52m 5s): I will say, first of all, the patterns that we saw weren't necessarily individual differences between people, but more so different patterns that we would find within the same episode or problem solving session. So a single person might produce a whole cluster of notations that were all tightly interlinked so that they would move fluidly from one to the next, from the diagram to an equation that might be describing something in the diagram to a English phrase that they'd written out.And that very same person might also produce these loops of inscription, where there was a natural order that they would travel through. So if nothing else, I think that's a nice quantitative demonstration that the way that we teach kids to do proofs in school, which is you start from the axioms and then you write out linearly from top to bottom, how you want to work through. That's not how mathematicians actually do math. It's a much more beautifully tangled process with different notations entering into different relationships with other notations within the larger quote ecosystem of the blackboard.So the first point there. Second point is I loved Simon's talk. And I actually went back and looked at our data to see if we found some of the same patterns of out and in edges, in not the sort of like statements or deductions that people were making, but their use of inscriptions. And it wasn't a perfect match, but it looked very, very similar to what Simon was reporting. So in the same way that Simon found that you can get these robust proofs if you have this nicely unbalanced relationship in how different statements are relating to each other. We found a similar pattern, this is unpublished stuff in the relationship between different scripts, which makes sense, right? Because these inscriptions are corresponding to some thought or statement or claim or inference, but it's nice to see that parallelism, if not like a strict isomorphism between how people are setting up these proofs as abstract inferences and then how they're actually structuring their world to arrive at those conclusions.Michael Garfield (54m 26s): So to a point that you made just a moment ago, you see examples of each in any given mathematicians approach to solving this. It strikes me that this goes back to what we were saying a moment ago or a few moments ago about the tension between explore and exploit. And that the sort of bursting in the patterns that you're observing you say in this precise amount of modularity likely reflects both the demands of the particular problem and the stochastic situated decisions.And I'm thinking, does this tell you something about the level of comfort that a mathematician has with the particular problem or rather like, are they building the bridge very slowly and carefully and or are they throwing these large ropes. You know, at what point do you realize you're stuck and that you have to back out and, and take a completely different approach? Again, there does seem like some kind of a family resemblance again to what the pattern we were seeing in the way that the jazz ensemble moves through its own kind of search space of interesting new musical possibilities.Yeah. And so, yeah, I guess when would I say this is like, what does a healthy mathematical ecosystem look like. If we were engineering these things, how would we want optimally to set up this ecosystem of inscriptions so that practicing mathematician would be most likely to arrive at, you know, a really fulfilling insight and that's exactly what we're doing right now. So one of my PhD students, Shoddy Tabatabian is looking at these network structural and also these sort of more dynamic measures like bursting us that you mentioned and seeing whether we can use those to predict when mathematicians are going to express an insight, when they're going to have that in some cases, a literal aha moment when, you know, in the videos, they're at the whiteboard, they're struggling, they're huffing and puffing. And then, you know, there's a beautiful park. And they said, I got it. When do those show up in relationship to the dynamics of inscription that have been going on before? Can we predict when that's going to happen based on the quote healthiness of their notational niche that they've set up, still working on the analysis. But what I suspect we'll find is something really similar to what we found with the jazz musicians which is that we can find these system level indicators that the jazz musicians are about to move into a new regime of sound production and the mathematician or the mathematician brain, body blackboard system is about to shift from a regime of confusion and frustration to one of fulfilling insight and realization.And so there's definitely that really, to us, very explicit parallel between the micro level ruptures, the critical transitions of the jazz performance and these slightly longer timescale rupture or critical transition in the mathematician.Michael Garfield (57m 36s): I could be getting this completely wrong, but it strikes me that what you're talking about here has a relationship to maybe parallel studies in the network dynamics of virality. You say here that the predictor with the largest relationship to burstiness and the only one that was statistically significant was modularity more modular inscription activity with communities of densely interconnected inscriptions was associated with more bursty temporal dynamics. And, you know, this reminds me a lot of, I cannot track the citation down to save my life, but I remember a few years ago saying that there was some research on what actually leads to a viral meme and it had to do with like saturating a local network.And then at that point, it sort of able to burst out. And the way that you're describing it could be somewhat analogous to the moment at which society at large has the idea, where it's on its own little island, mutating and then something clicks and suddenly it has percolated through everybody.Tyler Marghetis  (58m 41s): One difference here is that the network reputation we have of mathematical activity is much more serial and much less parallel compared to a network representation of virality, where in a network representation of orality, each node is a person who may or may not have adopted a particular meme or become interested in a musical genre if there was still exists while in the case of the mathematician, we're really tracking their attention as it shifts step-by-step from one inscription to the next.So that's perhaps a superficial difference, but it means that the mathematics of how we make sense of this is going to be slightly different. I will that in some of my other work, and this was a paper that we were maybe going to talk about today, but I don't think we'll have time to talk about it today is I am really interested in how these critical transitions in abstract thought occur at the even larger scale of entire societies or linguistic communities and there this metaphor of virality is absolutely germane.And so you mentioned George Lakoff at the top of the show, who's written and thought a lot about the metaphors, that structure, our thought, and that get into our language. And so for me, what happens with the jazz musician, where you have this critical transition from one sound world to the next, and what happens with the mathematician where you have this rupture from confusion to insight is in a certain sense, similar when you wear the foggy glasses of complexity science. Those two processes are really similar to what happens when an entire community goes from thinking and talking about, say the nature of time or justice or right governance to an entirely different one. And to me, the interesting questions are like, what are the generic mechanisms that allow us to understand and predict when this kind of human social system is going to go over the top of the waterfall and end up in entirelynew ones?Michael Garfield (1h 0m 46s): Well, I mean, it would seem that that has, when you fall over the edge, seems to have everything to do with where your body is and what it's doing. And we we've made it all the way back around in that regard. Well, okay, Tyler, this has been awesome. You've hinted at some of the direction that these inquiries are taking. That paper in particular had a rather extensive list of how you might see this kind of thing evolving over time in ways that you didn't actually apply in the study.What are some of the greatest unanswered questions for you that we haven't already touched on so far in this conversation? We'll leave people hanging.Tyler Marghetis  (1h 1m 29s): So for me, I'm really excited about stretching this work from the millisecond to the 10 minute, to the life, long creative insight timescale. And so I'm working with this wonderful data set that's been collected by this fantastic historian of art that has documented basically everything that Pablo Picasso ever produced in his life. And, you know, Picasso is this person who's constantly reinvented himself over and over again.He's all of a sudden he's painting everything blue and then pink and rose. Then all of a sudden he's doing cubism. And the question for me is, do we have similar dynamics on that scale of sort of lifelong creativity that you get on the micro millisecond scale of jazz improvisation? How are those similar, but maybe more importantly, how are those different, like, what's the cool stuff that happens when you're talking about lifelong creativity that isn't that player on a short timescale.And one possibility is that when you're a jazz musician riffing in a smoky basement, the sort of larger cultural trends that are happening outside are changing so slowly that you're not necessarily impacted by that. While someone like Picasso who's being creative and entire life span is ritually and productively entangled with other lives, other social trends, with world wars. And I think that entanglement of largely independent, but mutually interdependent systems is one of the really exciting places to look at these kinds of human critical transitions.These cascades from what one community is doing to what another community is doing to what's happening sort of broadly in the newspaper as to what one person is doing in their studio and trying to get some kind of empirical quantitative, nice analytic mathematical traction on that super broad, messy web of influences is what's keeping me up at night these days.Michael Garfield (1h 3m 38s): Well, if that's what it is, then I wish you insomnia, sir, for the good of all of us, this has been awesome. Thank you so much for taking the time. This is super fun.Thank you for listening.

67,Episode Details / Transcript W. Brian Arthur  (0s): Yeah, quite starkly economic theory was able to look at questions of what we call allocation quantities of this versus quantities of that. If the price of oil rose say 20% to reach a new equilibrium or balance, how much more hydro energy would Norway use or Sweden to substitute for the higher prices? The economics is wonderful, but a months and prices, unfortunately, economics is no rigorous theory or very little rigorous theory of where does an economy come from in the first place?How does it develop and grow? How does innovation work? How does economic development itself work? There was no way to mathematize those. And so anything to do with formation and process within the economy has been orphaned.Michael Garfield (1m 23s): What is the economy? People used to tell stories about the exchange of goods and services in terms of flows and processes, but over the last few hundred years, economic theory veered toward measuring discrete amounts of objects. Why the change has less to do with the objective nature of economies and more to do with what tools theorists had available and scientific instruments be they material technologies or concepts don't just make new things visible, but also hide things in new blind spots.For instance, algebra does very well with ratios and quantities, but fails to properly address what markets do, how innovation works, where value comes from and how economic actors navigate and change a fundamentally uncertain shifting landscape with the advent of computers, new opportunities emerged to study that which cannot be contained in an equation using algorithms. Scientists can formalize complex behaviors and thinking economics in both nouns and verbs provides a more complete and useful stereoscopic view of what we are and do. Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute.I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far-ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week we speak with W. Brian Arthur of the Santa Fe Institute, Stanford University, and Xerox about his recent essay, Economics and Nouns and Verbs. In this first half of a two-part conversation, we explore how a mathematics of static objects fails to describe economies in motion and how I process based approach can fill gaps in our understanding.If you can't wait two weeks for part to dig through our archives for more Brian Arthur in episodes, 13 and 14, if you value our research and communication efforts, please subscribe to complexity podcast wherever you prefer to listen, rate and review us at Apple Podcasts and/or consider making a donation at santafe.edu/give.

W. Brian Arthur it is a pleasure to have you back on Complexity Podcast.W. Brian Arthur (3m 54s): I'm delighted.Michael Garfield (3m 56s): So when we had you here the first time we spoke in very, very grand sweeping terms about the history and the future of complexity economics. This call, we have an opportunity to focus on something a little bit more granular, which is this pre-print that you've written Economics in Nouns and Verbs and the sea change or phase transition that you seem to believe is now necessary for us to adopt a more complete and comprehensive and practical approach to economic theory.So why don't we start in the prehistory of this paper a little bit, and what motivated this line of thinking for you and what led to the development of these ideas in your case?W. Brian Arthur (4m 47s): Somehow in the last five to 10 years, I got fascinated by computation. I should start out by saying I'm trained mostly as an applied mathematician, PhD in operations research, but that was all mathematics, very much trend in math and engineering. So my language of science, so to speak, is standard mathematics, but for some reason, some just sheer interest I got fascinated by computation 5, 10, 15 years ago. And then the last five years, I started to read some classics. What Alan Turing had written in 1936. I was reading Greg Chaitin’s ideas on algorithmic information theory, many other things, just trying to wrestle with what really was computation all about. And then I realized something else.I began to realize that my own papers, and I think many of us at Santa Fe Institute could say the same 20 ago, 30, 40 years ago when I'm starting out my papers where mathematical, meaning expressed an algebra, calculus, linear algebra, and so on. And now I can say many things fluently, just like other people in complexity, but I tend to say them computationally.And I started to wonder what had happened. And I began to realize that all the sciences are shifting in their means of expression from mathematics or standard mathematics to computation. I began to wonder why, so I don't want to say mathematics is dead, but I realized that there was a precedent for this in the 16 hundreds. So at the year 16 hundreds, in fact, for another 120 years after that mathematics was geometry.But in that century, maybe 10 years before that, and 20 years after the 16 hundreds, algebra came in and started slowly to take over as mathematics or the language of science. And so I began to investigate that, and that was absolutely great fun. Algebra was bitterly opposed by Kepler. He called it gauche sometime around 1625. Thomas Hobbes, compared it to, as if chickens had been scratching on the page with all these silly symbols and Isaac Newton discovered called algebra, the analysis of bunglers didn't stop him using it, but I don't think he was too honest about it at least early on.So when I talk about mathematics, I've noticed that the idea of what is mathematics keeps changing. So 1600 old geometry, 1720, 1750 it shifted, and now mathematics is largely taken to be algebra. What eventually came to be linear algebra as well, and the calculus. And of course there's many, many other parts of mathematics I need to say that are not algebra group theory, number theory, probability theory, all sorts of other branches of mathematics. What I'm talking about here as standard mathematics is roughly how theories are expressed in journals, whether they be physics engineering and in this case economics. And so that changed from being geometry to algebra.In fact, I was quite amused that when Kant was starting to look at chemistry and must have been around the 1780s, if I recall, right, he chided it for not being scientific. And what did he mean? Well, he said it's not expressed in mathematics. And what did that mean? Well, it wasn't algebra, so there'd been a big shift. And I began to realize that we're in the middle of another shift at the moment, shift in language from seeing theory is being expressed first as geometry, then as algebra, and now as a computation, or I should say more precisely expressed algorithmically in some way where possibly a computer could handle that.And there's similar resistance. There's similar outrage. And also I want to stress here at the outset that there isn't a final language I think for science, at least I hope not. We still use geometry heavily all over the place every time we write a graph down or show an image or something, some sort of tabulation, we often refer to geometry because it appeals to us in our brands visually. We do use algebra. I don't think that's going to stop, but we're getting a sort of third language alongside these two. And that language is computational. It used to be considered the following model. And then there'd be a set of equations. Now it's much more, let me put together the following model, assume, and then there'd be something algorithmic written down.So I began to wonder where all that had come from and what it was going to deliver. And was this just fashionable? And was there a certain amount of just hyper BS or whatever that somehow we could all do computation. Everybody can do mathematics at least through trend in science, but I want to give you a quick story of where this really came from. My interest came from one single comment that a colleague made external member of the Santa Fe Institute, a good friend of mine.I'd written a book about technology and how it evolves. And the book was written in plain English. My model was Darwin had written his book on species originate on how evolution works. And he had written that in planning this, that was my model. And at one stage I wrote down a sequence of steps by which technology has come about, replace previous technologies, like the railway train and railways replace canal technology. They're called forth further technologies, railways needed messages.And so rail was called forth telegraphy the Telegraph. They called forth a lot of R and eventually steelmaking and so on. And railways became a component in overall transportation and they eventually changed the economy, changed society, and changed the way we do things all over the space of several decades. So I readjust this to a series of steps or what you'd call an algorithm. The comment, my good colleague, he blurbed the book.He said, I love your book. I have learned an enormous amount from this book. He was all full of praise, but you know, Brian, he said this privately, he says, but it's not science. I said, what do you mean it's not science? Where are the equations? And so I had a what the bleep moment and I was offended and I don't know, bloody hell, this is science as much as anything else.It was argued logically based on an offload of observations.  I went back. And I started to think if a theory or a story that we tell in science, how things form, if that is expressed in terms of algorithms, step one, step two, and so on, instead of equations, does that mean it's not science? And so I started to look at the whole question, could algorithms be science?I'll give you more answers to that later on, but that's really what prompted me, got my goat and motivated the whole thing. I never told my colleague later, but I did send him the paper.Michael Garfield (14m 7s): Well, that's actually great because in walking people through this, it seems like the right place to start is at the beginning where you set the stage with a little bit of the logic from the nature of technology, talking about the way that science proceeds as much by its instruments, as it does by our thoughts and the way that different instruments, you give the example of an MRI scan or a CT scan, reveal, different aspects of the world, reveal different phenomena. And that to draw term that you talked about in this book and you, and I think talked about in our first conversation, you just have Schumpeter and his idea of creative destruction and the way that when a new technological mileau, matures it not only reveals certain new affordances, but also forecloses on others.And so there's the sense in which it's not simply a building on, it's a replacement of, and I like the point that you make in here that as you put it, I believe mathematics is powerful and economics and necessary, but I don't believe that it is suited to describing all that is interesting in an economy. In fact, I don't believe that given the complication of the economy and the humanness of the people who act within it, there is any privileged way to view the economy. So just starting there, which is a very large, you know, it's a grand philosophical claim, but it's a claim based on a rather robust pattern that you observe in your work.And the way that if we think about math as a tool than different sub-domains of math, provide us different cognitive affordances. And then this is where if you care to comment on that, great, but this seems like a place where we can actually dive into the way that a noun based economics differs from an economics based on verbs as well like what the concrete distinctions are between the worlds that each of these tools disclose to us.W. Brian Arthur (16m 5s): When I was writing about technology or the nature of technology, I spent quite a few years, probably a dozen or four years looking at technologies and really trying to understand them in great depth and trend in technology or in engineering. And in particular, I started to look at the history of science and I realized that science didn't proceed by wonderful theoretical ideas, followed by measurements, which is what we're told.There's plenty of that, but really new instruments might come along almost randomly, so to speak. And then they would give us a new view of what was out there in nature. Classic thing is when Galileo makes his own telescope and points the heavens January 16, 10, and notice some fixed stars behind Jupiter and notices a few days later, when he looks again, the fixed stars, aren't fixed, they're moving.And a few days later, he realizes, oh my God moment, that these are moons around Jupiter. And suddenly the whole world view shifts in that moment because everything in those days was supposed to revolve around the sun or the earth, depending on what fuel you took. And here are things revolving around Jupiter. So that was a sort of, oh my God moment.And it came about because Galileo had a new instrument, telescope. Similarly, I noticed that I started to get into a nuclear magnetic resonance, MRI machines, and they can look at the same thing. There could look at your arm. It might have a fracture. MRI imaging and hospitals shows you in great detail, the soft tissue. So if you're looking in terms of maybe some sort of hernia or something, that's what you would want to use.CT scanning by contrast looks at bones much better. So it was the same thing. You're looking at an arm, but one instrument was showing you soft tissue, the others showing you hard tissue or bones, bone structure. And that gives you a very different view, just two instruments. And then I took an interest in Helio physics, the physics of the sun. And yeah, you see the familiar pattern much as everyone from Galileo, a radiating sphere of energy and light with a few things going on in the surface, plasma injections and things like that.But then I started to look at X-ray telescopes pointed at the sun, the images they were showing. And again, there was a moment where I was slightly shocked. The sun didn't appear normal. It had big fishers running through it more or less diagonally. And it looked almost as if it was ready to break in half. I think listeners should take a look for themselves far from perfect sphere and very peculiar looking, not at all uniform and just riven through by these gigantic fishers.And so began to realize that different instruments of seeing are instruments of understanding or instruments of exploring showed you different things. It's an elementary point, but I realized too that when there are new instruments of looking, then they show you new things and science changes as a result. Now it's not the only way science changes, but that's certainly the history of science, I think, is more advancements in instruments of seeing or understanding than it is just thinking. If we had science that was just pure thinking, we'd have the science of the Greeks.And we don't. The reason is now of course, we've particle accelerators. We have x-ray crystallography. We very advanced instruments for looking and those give us a whole world. And we have to adjust our worldview to what we see. I began to realize also that mathematics was an instrument of understanding. And that was also slightly a shock when we went from just using geometry to understand say the heavens and switched. So that would have been true on the time of Copernicus or Galileo. And we started to use algebra that Newton did. We see more precisely, we see different things. We get  new explanations that are detailed and quite accurate for planetary orbits being elliptical and so on. So mathematics then shows something different. It's not just a language that we use, algebra calculus or whatever.It's actually more like an instrument that you're appearing through and what you see. So feel free to interrupt at any stage, but let me move on quickly to economics. Economics is very much based on geometry, not totally, but heavily based on geometry until, and an armchair speculation and just Oracle analysis up until about 18, seven years.So, and then it became very much interested, slightly obsessed eventually by algebraic mathematics. Now I include all the modern stuff that was brought to this day. I'm talking about algebra, largely calculus, linear algebra. So the kind of mathematics we're taught to apply in graduate school. And I began to wonder what sort of economics to that give you. A few years ago, I wrote a book called complexity in the economy and I around about 2014, 20 5, I had been thinking heavily about algebra.And I began to realize that algebra is wonderful. I'm a huge supporter because that's my toolbox largely. I began to realize that algebra as a language or as an instrument of seeing, or as an instrument of exploring dealt only with quantifiable objects. So if you say X plus Y equals 115, the X must be quantities, measurable quantity.And so most of the Y because algebra is fundamentally a form of arithmetic. It's a means of arithmetic that's carried out partially symbolically. So you've coefficients, you've XYZ, symbols, you've plus signs. You can do arithmetic operations. You can take square roots of equations. You can get X to the power of an and all this sort of thing, but it remains a more general arithmetic.In fact, I think it was in 1707 that Isaac Newton put his lecture notes together and published a book called Universal Arithmetic. But what he really meant was algebra. So if you set up anything in algebra terms, or we would not say mathematical terms, the things you set up had to be quantitative nouns, and almost without thinking economics adopted this, the 1870s on through to the modern day, theories started to become more and more mathematical.And I had wondered earlier, why did economics deal nearly all was nouns? So quantities produced quantities consumed. Those are nouns. Rates of this and of that prices a month traded numbers of firms, economic growth. These are all nouns. And of course it could object and say, well, hang on. I read the newspapers and they've talked about firms going into chapter 11 and real events. OPEC doing something in the oil industry and so on, but doing something or carrying out something or some process isn't easily expressible in algebraic mathematics.And so it gets dropped. And I began to realize there was a giant sieve in economic theory if economic theory is expressed in standard mathematics than anything that had to do with processes or events fell through the sieve. And the only thing retained for years were nouns,  rates of this and rates of that. And I sat down and I thought, what difference does that make to economics?I began to realize, you know, I started to look at older writings and economics. I came across a lovely passage. I was quite familiar with actually by Alfred Marshall. Marshall is writing around 1890 and he was talking about why industry is custard. You know, why is there say a leather industry in Italy or even a violin industry in Cremona?This is what Marshall says. When an industry has chosen a locality for itself, it's likely to stay there long. So greater the advantages from people following the same skill trade get from being near one another, it's as if the mysteries of the trade were in the air, good work is rightly appreciated. Inventions and improvements happen in machinery and processes. The general organization of the business have their merits promptly discussed.If one man starts a new idea is taken up with, by others and combined with suggestions of their own and so on. So what he's talking about is not rates of this and the months of that. What Marshall's really talking about as a whole process of the formation of industry and how events, something happens, somebody discovers some new thing it's discussed down at the pub in his day. It's talked about by people in the same tread may be taken up.It may be improved upon, but these are all processes. And then I started to look at passages from Paul Samuelson, the great economist who had more than anybody, in my opinion, mathematized economics. And this was in the 1940s and Samuelson was writing about how international tread could be expressed in terms of economics.And he imagined the scientists trying to maximize the raw total of clothing production in Portugal and England subject to certain constraints. So the passage reads Z equals X sub two equals X, sub two, and X sub two prime is to be maximized subject to X one plus X one prime equals capital X one. And so on.It's just pure algebra. It's actually what I would call linear programming. This sort of mathematics I specialized in, but what struck me about the passage was that there were no human relations in there. It was all nouns related to other nouns. There was no word in narrative. There is no idea of humans actually trading, no firms were mentioned and people and actions and events had been edited out just to sort of shoe horn, all of this into the algebraic sausage machine and the whole thing, I'm being somewhat snide.But again, this is my stock and trade so I can say this.  This has been a shocker. If you hold those two passages alongside each other, Alfred Marshall was trained in mathematics in the 1860s. He was second wrangler if I remember, Lord Raleigh in the trippers in Cambridge member of Trinity College. So it was one, a hell of a good mathematician in his day. And a trend in mathematical physics became an economist, but his story is his theory as wordy something's in the air, children pick it up.Ideas are discussed. That's processy, that's very be 60 or so years later, then we got Paul Samuelson, 50 years later, even who's got religion. He thinks that economics should be like theoretical physics. And we should take out all these silly stories and just concentrate on X sub one plus X prime sub one equals capital X.Doesn't do it for me. I realized that we had lost something. So just to summarize all of this, using the language of algebra, calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, that sort of mathematics reduces economics to relations between quantities and in particular, then that rules out stories and it rules out events and it rules up processes.And once I realized that I began to realize why I had because had been trained in mathematics, I thought it would be natural to study economics at Berkeley, actually under mathematicians. When I tried to do that, I couldn't stand the courses I was given. I specialized in those days in what's now called development economics, looking at what we'd call developing countries or in those days, third world countries and how they develop. Economic development think in terms of India at the time or countries in Africa, economic development was described in noun form as a country was developing. If its GDP, which is, was improving or increasing by at least 1%, after all his thoughts, I began to realize that that's like saying an embryo, like a human baby is developing in the womb.You could say it's developing and turning into a human being. If it's volume or weight was improving or increasing by more than 1% in a given time, maybe in two weeks or something like that. And I thought, sure, it's a measure of development. It's not totally awful, but it doesn't tell you a single thing about what development is or how embryos for that matter develop. You can't just say it grows.It fades away. We have a phrase and economics, we talk about up upsy downsy economics, quantities down, prices up, prices up quantities, doing something else. Unemployment up prices down. And so this is the way we think about economics. It's like, as if there's all these colored test tubes all in a row, and one of them says oil prices. And one of them says unemployment and the liquids in each are moving up and down.And it seems to be the job of economics to connect these different non-quantities, using some ideas, but how they do connect and then working out of mathematics for what affects, what it's mechanical. It's completely quantity, a noun based. It's not wrong. It gives us plenty of insights and I don't expect this to change. But when it comes to any questions of formation, how does an economy form. How does a new technology form? How does the new technology come about?How does innovation work? How is a new industry formed and set up when a set of new technologies comes along, think of mass production or automobiles or electronics, or the digital technologies, how do industries change? How does structural change? Those are all questions of formation. And there you start to look at those.You realize those are all processes and processes require verbs, but you can't handle verbs in the standards, mathematical language, at least in standard algebra and calculus. So what do you do, you just talk about, well, there's more of this and there's less of that. This is growing. That's fading away. This is replacing the number of new firms is this. And so on. Most people would say that economic theory is theory expressed in standard mathematical form, but standard mathematical form reduces you to only quantitative objects or a quantitative amount.So all of economic theory is based upon this amount affects that amount. Left out is process any idea that there could be events or it could be verbs, or it could be actions and interactions. There could be actions triggering other actions, or it could be actions, inhibiting other actions. And we could think about that. We could talk about that and people have, and people. Do Austrian economics for example, it's a school of economics has been around for a long time, thinks in terms of actions and processes and verbs, but it's ruled to the side because you can't express that and standard mathematics. Therefor it's not proper theory. Therefor it doesn't count. So this is, I think there are other missing thing. And let me just say here that, you know, if somebody says, okay, you know, are you anti theory or you anti mathematics and economics?No, no, not at all. That's what I've done for most of my career. I'm not completely reformed either. I will continue to use mathematics, but I do think that it's a restrictive language. It restricts our thoughts to a months of this affecting the months of that. And it precludes us going inside. What is economic development? How does Silicon Valley change where the new inventions come from?You can't look at that in a set of equations at all easily. And those are all processes that you can get inside the processes. And you can understand those processes. Economic development, for example, has an awful lot to do with new credit coming available. Simple banks being set up. It has to do with people setting up schools, setting up new things, trying something and failing, maybe buying trucks, delivering something, maybe new railway destinations being opened up.So these are all processes. There are by no means deterministic. Something happens here. Something happens there. They kind of do follow a pattern, but that pattern isn't led down deterministically and yet countries to develop. So to put it quite starkly economic theory was able to look at questions of what we call allocation, quantities of this versus quantities of that.If the price of oil rose say 20% to reach a new equilibrium or balance, how much more hydro energy would Norway use or Sweden to substitute for the higher prices? Economics is wonderful about amounts and prices. Economics had to bypass. Unfortunately, economics is new rigorous theory or very little rigorous theory of how, where does an economy come from in the first place?How does it develop and grow? How does innovation work? How does economic development itself work? All of these had to be left out. They've all been explored of course, and where they form, but there was no way to mathematize those. And so they're kind of the orphans stepchildren. If that's not contradiction in terms of economics, anything to do with formation and process within the economy has been orphaned.You say, well, isn't that true in all science? I mean, isn't physics about velocities and position and amounts and quantities of energy and mass, all this sort of thing.. Certainly up until the last several decades, but biology is all about process. Whether it's molecular copying of DNA or replacement of DNA or messenger RNA, things like that.These are all processes. How cells form, how molecules replicate in particular at the DNA level, how embryos form, how neural processes work within the human brain, those are processes. And we're understanding them as process. And this explains to me why biology couldn't be mathematized. There's a kind of oddity. Yet i's all important. And it's becoming central in the science itself. So biology is an oddity because nearly everything that looks at including things like sequencing DNA, that's a process of synthetic biology. It's a set of processes. They can't easily be mathematized because what counts, isn't quantities or numbers of stuff, what counts is events, that trigger events. And so on.Michael Garfield (40m 53s): So it occurs to me listening to you speak about this, that in the history that you present of economic thinking, all of the math is before the publication of the Origin of Species. And that like the reason that you keep turning to biology seems to be that biology made this transition. And the 19th century between basically a static taxonomy, a version of the world in which all of the species have been created and are timeless and permanent to a world in which species go extinct and species are created in an ongoing sort of innovation process.So likewise algorithmic thinking seems to emerge through a kind of a Darwinian paradigm shift that you get this notion of the world as essentially an emanation of these eternal forms in the mind of God, to a world in which everything is in flux and the resistance that the theory has experienced and its various implications has a lot to do with the visceral discomfort that many people feel with the idea that the self and various other things that we take for granted as static as solid ground upon which to base our understanding of the world are in fact constantly in flux. I read a fabulous paper about this as relates to science, fictional horror, Eric White, The Erotics of Becoming: Xenogenesis and the Thing  where he talks about why it is that so many horror movies are about an ever-metamorphosing monster.And that it's related to the discomfort that the world experienced at the idea that we had evolved from monkeys and that would have evolved into something else, that the human is not this archetypical perfect, you know, static crystal and thing. But it's just one point along an ever-shifting continuum of possible forms relating to each other. I liked the way that you continually draw people's attention in this work to the fact that an algebraic equation system does not endogenously generate new variables.I mean, you said as much just now that it's pre-specified when you say, okay, this is you've already decomposed the system. You've already recognized all of the salient features of it. And it's funny because again, to view these different mathematical modalities as themselves evolutionary products that are like adaptations to a time and a place that this sausage machine that you're talking about of traditional economic thinking, it results in this particular effort to try and squeeze the universe into the shortest possible equation, right?In a way it looks like these revenue models that try to maximize externalities, it's like let's make this efficient as possible and then build on those efficiencies and create these mature ecosystems where the winners are betting on efficiencies given by economies of scale. But you get to a point where there's a disruption from within or from beyond the ecosystem. And then suddenly those finely tuned equations no longer work to describe a world that is changing rapidly under the influence of say an asteroid impact or to give an indogenous, you know, rapid technological change caused by networked electronic technologies.And at that point, David Krakauer, and I talked about this back in Episode 29 that you see when the equilibrium quote unquote is punctuated, you make a point that all of this math biases us towards equilibrium thinking. What's like, well, that makes sense if the world that you're living in, isn't changing in unexpected, freaky ways every day, but then suddenly you need a non-equilibrium model because the world that you're living in is clearly not in equilibrium. And you get these strategies, like he talks about the high mutation rates of viruses because the host body is always changing.Their environment is always changing or the way that generalists tend to do really well or high beta investment strategies tend to do really well in periods of market crashes and mass extinctions and so on. So that's where we get this new epistemology of immutable self. You know, the Bucky Fuller, I am a verb. The Alfred North Whitehead’s process philosophy. And again, this was recently formalized deliciously in a paper I love bringing up on the show, Krakauer led this paper,Information Theory of Individuality.It shows that the category of the individual is itself something that emerges out of these relational processes. It's informational integrity through time, or it's informational scaffolding by its environment. It's just funny how it's not just that the theories disclose new worlds, but that they themselves seem to be the precipitates of our interaction with the world. And that in a shift to an algorithmic economics, one that allows us to explain where new technologies come from and the way that our various relational processes lead to unexpected phenomena and the way that this helps us sort of strip ourselves of the bias of equilibrium and also of rationality, because you can't have perfect knowledge about a world that's always changing and about which you are learning everything through these relationships.It's just funny that it seems that the tools required to make this methodological shift in the practice of economics are big data machine learning vastly in complex simulations, which are the theory itself as sort of the desired output. And again, Krakauer and other folks at SFI have written a lot about this in terms of the tension between prediction and understanding like it's really not important in the midst of a crisis to be able to understand what's going on so much as it is to be able to predict what's going to happen next.You see this bifurcation in the 21st century. I mean, it's been there the whole time in one form or another, but you see it really pronounced in this split between the efforts to arrive at a general theory and the acceptance that really what we need to be doing is just generating as much knowledge from our data as we can. So, that's just a riff that I'd love to pass back to you and how that sort of shifts the emphasis from maximizing externalities to closing economic circuits, to understand these processes in their completeness, and then folding all those externalities back in where we may not understand what we're actually looking at anymore, or that's no longer sort of the ultimate goal.But now we know at least that we don't have such a naive idea about value creation, where it's basically like some kind of cooking the books, this notion that value just emerges de novo out of it's like actually it's revealed to be something that was hidden by the very fact that we were using equations to think about these matters,W. Brian Arthur (48m 31s): There's about a half a dozen or a dozen ideas in what you're saying. So let me see if I can comment on some of them. And I think you're getting it all the important things, just a one footnote to make sure facts are straight. Darwin published the Origin of Species in 1859. And coincidentally mathematization of economics really took off in the 1870s. And from there after Darwin's ideas, in fact, Alfred Marshall, who was part of that process of mathematizing economics famously said the Mecca of economics is biology.He had read Darwin. He wanted an evolutionary economics and that evolutionary economics, he couldn't see how to do it. So he was very much instrumental in this equilibrium view and economics doesn't deny change. It just says, okay, we'll have a screenshot of the economy here. Then maybe firms electrified and stop using steam engines.So we have another screenshot. We go from this cycle librium to that equilibrium. It's rather like saying that children grow up and that's age two that look like this and that age 11, they look like something else. It's fine. But it doesn't really explain any process of how things develop. And if you're looking at the developments of a system of arteries or of neural systems, it doesn't work in finite snapshots.And I think Marshall knew this in the 1890s, but there wasn't much she could do about it. And yeah, there is a bias and standard mathematics. It's not quite insurmountable. All of this is just awkward. I think standard mathematics is I keep saying has been wonderful at explaining relationships in economics, how incentives arise, how different forces in the economy bring forth certain behaviors, how behaviors are related, how prices in one sector steel might be affected by prices of oil. Standard economics standard mathematics allows us to understand all of this extremely well.What it doesn't do is show us how things evolve and come about.Michael Garfield (51m 30s): Thank you for listening.

68,Episode Details / Transcript W. Brian Arthur (0s): Around the first quarter of the 20th century, people were hoping that there was a kind of axiomatic system that we could drive all of mathematics from, that this was timeless. That any number you could think of such as Pi or e were given, and then there was a natural reaction against that and said, oh, how do you know? And people were saying, well, you can't really rely on things being given in a platonic universe.What you could rely on is, is there a way to construct these? Is there some algorithmic way whereby you can see how the digits of Pi may follow each other. Though, if that's the case, you'll never know what lies at the end of pi. At any time, you might know a finite number, but you don't know what lies in definitely on the other side. There's an openness in what those digits are.So people began to see mathematics and possibly physics as not being given, but as something where you had to ask what processes generate numbers and the best you could say is we can have a well-timed method to derive those digits of pi, but we don't know exactly what they're going to be.Michael Garfield (1m 53s): Can you write a novel using only nouns? Well, maybe, but it won't be very good nor easy, nor will it tell a story. Verbs link events allow for narrative communicate becoming. So why in telling stories of our economic lives, have people settled into using algebraic theory, ill-suited to the task of capturing the fundamentally uncertain, open and evolving processes of innovation and exchange.Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks, to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week on Complexity we bring our two-part conversation with SFI external professor W. Brian Arthur to a climax, a visionary exploration of multiple scientific methodologies that takes us from I Chingto AlphaGo, Henri Bergson to Claude Shannon, artificial life, to a forgotten mathematics with the power to just maybe save the future from inadequate and totalizing axioms.We pick up by revisiting the end of part one in episode 68.

In the history that you present of economic thinking all of the math is before the publication of the origin of species.

Brian Arthur (6m 34s): Okay. I think you're getting it all the important things. Just one footnote to make sure facts are straight. Darwin published The Origin of Species in 1859. And coincidentally mathematization of economics really took off in the 1870s. And from there after Darwin's ideas, in fact, Alfred Marshall, who was part of that process of mathematizing economics famously said, the Mecca of economics is biology.He had read Darwin.

But it doesn't really explain any process of how things develop. And if you're looking at the developments of a system of arteries or of neural systems, it doesn't work in finite snapshots.And I think Marshall knew this in the 1890s, but there wasn't much she could do about it. And there is a bias in standard mathematics. It's not quite insurmountable. All of this is just awkward. I think standard mathematics is I keep saying has been wonderful at explaining relationships and economics, how incentives arise, how different forces in the economy bring forth certain behaviors, how behaviors are related, how prices in one sector steel might be affected by prices of oil. Standard economics standard mathematics allows us to understand all of this extremely well.What it doesn't do is show us how things evolve and come about. So just a couple of things. Yes, standard mathematics tends to biases towards a system that doesn't have new variables coming along. You set up a model with variables X, Y, Z, maybe sometime further, a new variable might be invented or come along, say P and then another one, Q and R, but it's kind of awkward and hard to that in mathematics.So I'm not saying processes can't be handled in algebra, but generally speaking, it's awkward. Just to amuse myself I wondered what would it be like to write a novel using only nouns. Somebody told me that Virginia Woolf had actually experimented with that. And then I started to wonder, and I don't want to be too mean here, but what would be like to sort of say they kissed using only nouns and the way I would do this, as you know, let's variable P be the position of his lips in three dimensions at variable P prime position of her lips.And then you would say something like as T tends to sometime capital T the absolute value of P minus P prime goes to zero. So you can do it, but in a there's a kind of for God's sake. Why didn't you just say they kissed and I don't want to make fun of mathematics too much, but I do think that what I'm emphasizing is the different languages of expression. Algebraic, mathematics, and other mathematics would give you different views of the world.You can shoe horn, all of these things into geometry, or it's harder to shoe horn, four and five dimensions into geometry or end dimensions. And that's part of why algebra took over. And it's hard to shoe horn processes with novel structures appearing into standard algebra. Algebra's good at saying this grows and this diminishes, this is up, this is done.And so on. One thing I want to say, as you're talking, this is probably not in very logical sequence, but you mentioned none of this. Anyway, you mentioned that there's a growing idea or set of ideas in science and in philosophy that you would know about, I'm sure in both a movement towards saying things sort of exist, but hang on, they're changing.So you can say planets exist. But if you look in a longer time, you can’t say, well, there is such a thing as Jupiter through all the eons of the solar system, it's that Jupiter’s in process. It's changing the source. The sun is the earth. And so there's something you mentioned called process philosophy dating from Alfred North Whitehead and before. And there are modern exponents of that.John Dupre is very much in this area. There are some really thoughtful people thinking about the world, not so much as having fixed objects, but that everything in the world is changing. And in process for me, I'm thrilled and amused that this brings us back to ancient Chinese philosophy. I just want to mention that I'm a huge fan of Taoist philosophy.And in that philosophy, they'd be reluctant to say any pattern is there for good. In fact, everything was evolving, changing, new things are forming. One thing is bringing into being the next thing and so on. So one of the oldest books on that, the I Ching is basically the book of change and we're starting, somebody could say, well, all right, is algebraic mathematics with all its equilibrium and it's fixed variables.And its nouns is that over and not at all. But it may  appear that Jupiter isn't changing that much and maybe in the next million years or so. So it's convenient to look at things as fixed and growing or changing in amounts. However, over a longer term, it's not much good to set a new industry, arises, computation arises.What set of variables, for example, if you were looking at computation in the 1970s would tell you that the cloud becomes important. Three, four decades later I don't know what would tell you that telecommunications becomes important. So these things matter. We went from computation in the 1960s and seventies to being about machines on those machines, processed numbers industrially.So this was called information processing. And then weirdly the erbium doped photon amplifier gets invented around 1987 and suddenly photonic information transmission becomes available industrially and similar sort of timescale, really good satellites. So suddenly by the early nineties, the scene has changed, it's like in a dream there's telecommunications as possible over phone lines and they’re slow.And I can even remember those days and suddenly there's photon transmission, there's fiber optics and there's satellite transmission. So suddenly you can be an architectural firm in Seattle and you can have your detailing done in real time by a back office in Budapest. You could be a car manufacturer and Detroit and have parts supplied in China. That changes ,you get offshoring.You get a completely different economy that leads to its new problems, but there's no way in 1970 or 1980, even in my opinion, where you could see any of that coming. So questions of change and formation and a slightly longer term than just looking at the next three years are extraordinarily important because the economy is always exploring and has processes of finding completely new things and restructuring itself.I want to mention, and I think this has to do with, and still on the subject of your questions I hope, so is everything I'm saying just a big downer? Well, we have to be careful. We have to be careful about using standard mathematics and economics. If you think of it as focusing certain things, you can see quantity relations, how things are related, how things affect each other.Wonderful, but it leaves out the idea of new structures and of processes affecting other processes and inhibiting other processes. So is there any mathematics that would take care of that? And there are such things as processed algebras and so on, but that's not what we use. So my answer is I began to realize slowly, oh my God, there is, of course, it's computation.And I don't mean just making simulations and crunching numbers. Let me give my take on computation. I think not so much in terms of computers or pranking through things, but in terms of thinking algorithmically, algorithms are set up so that you can have processes execute this in this way and watch the process executing.And after a while, if such and such is greater than if the number of iterations is greater than a hundred, then call a sub sub-process. If it's not called a different process. So algorithms are set up basically as sequences of events that call or inhibit other sequences of events, and often those processes or events form some news structure.And this is all not just because they're algebraically based. They're heavily equation based most algorithms, but it's that they have if then conditional branching as it's called. And if you have done enough of such and such, and you can track a process, just like you might be an industrial process and then say, boom, we've done enough of that. Let's switch over to a different process. I don't want to see the entire world that way.That would be a bit too mechanical. But what I will say is that that gives us an alternative language, one in which you can express verbs. This action happens that action triggers that action then inhibits those actions. And if you have enough of that, then something else happens. So algorithms are stories about how processes set in motion other processes, or stopped processes happening, but they're not deterministic.You can feed in some form of randomness and you might find you're going down this path, rather than that path. You could in principle do some of this or quite a bit of it algebraically, but it'd be like saying we can do geometry pretty well in three dimensions. Let's try to do it on six dimensions on principle. But the language is awkward. So what you can do with computation, or I would prefer to say algorithmic language or algorithmic mathematics is to track processes, allow those to create new structures.Those new structures might create new processes all within the algorithm working itself out, all endogenous. So you get endogenous change. I would go even further. What I noticed about computation is that computation or algorithmic processes respond in a magnificent way to context. So you can say, okay, I'm using an algorithm to steer my aircraft.This is actually what happens. Fly by wire it’s called in the aircraft business, the wires being computer connection. So an aircraft may be traveling along, say 35,000 feet. Let's say it's an Airbus or whatever. And it's responding to outside buffeting. It's responding, maybe being rerouted, checking where weather is and checking its current position and automatically as a process adjusting.And so a lot of that's done mathematically and that's what's my background is very much the sort of control.  But if something happens, if some condition changes, if there's a nearby aircraft unexpectedly, the context changes. So algorithms with if then conditions, the if part says, if fireman steady air, do this. If there is weather ahead and 50 miles trigger the rerouting algorithm, if something else happens, if I'm held up at near an airport, go into a holding position.If the price of tea in China changes then do such and such. So what algorithms lose and I want to be very clear on this is you can't easily see the logic working out. Things are more complicated. What mathematicians love about mathematics is it set up the system, just like a sort of Sherlock Holmes cast of characters. You set up the rules for the relations and the equations.Then you start cranking and start manipulating the equations. If this is true, then that has to be true. Another few lines introduction, then that has to be true. And you get these moments in mathematics, oh, so that's how that works. Then you get this structure. Whoa. And then that leads to that. Wow. And then that explains why such and such is in relation to that. And you get this tremendous high from doing this sort of algebraic standard mathematics.You can't get that high with algorithms. They just play out probably inside a computer or maybe inside your head, but you don't see that. So it's a big disadvantage of computation. You can say equally with algebra, you can't see the geometry working out on some graph, unless you plotted simple. It's so computation or algorithms work their way out.We don't see what's going on and so on, but they have this wonderful compensation that's you can make them more detailed arbitrarily. So if you need more detail here, you can put more detail into the algorithm. That's an art, but all mathematics is art. You can track the context changing. So an algorithm may be partly creating its own context.Imagine an algorithm that's looking at cars and dense traffic. Traffic doesn't exist per se. Cars exist and cars are responding to cars around them and their neighborhood slowing down, speeding up, passing other cars. And we can call the local pattern cars or creating. We can call that traffic. So the cars are creating the traffic. The traffic is causing the cars to respond. The traffic if you like as the context that the cars are creating. So this is I think at the essence of complexity and why it applies to the economy, individual objects in this case cars, are creating a fluid context that the individual elements have to react to. That's algorithmic. You could do it possibly with a bit of stress and strain algebraically, but with if then conditions, you can do it beautifully.If some car in front or behind gets too close, then move to another lane or something like that. So it's harder to do that in algebra, could be done in principle, but now we can do this algorithmically. So algorithms are much better at detail. Detail can be arbitrary. We don't have to say all players are agents and the economy or identical. We don't have to say the rational.We have models to say here's how they might explore and make sense. Any changes in pattern their respond to their immediate context. So changes in pattern and new structures can arise endogenously with algorithms. And I think above all algorithms can generate new things that we haven't seen before. So I don't know what system of equations you could write down to teach some system how to play Go.And yet with alpha go zero, which is essentially suite of algorithms, you're basically saying, okay, I'll tell you the rules for the game of Go, but you're going to have to develop some smart and inductive way, maybe over days or weeks of computation to play a good game, but not with human input, with the actual intelligence of that game arising by playing against some other version of yourself.And so alpha goes zero is based upon that. You can't get that easily with equations or somebody might say, well, in principle, theoretically, you could, but it would take many, many universes, an infinite amount of time almost to arrive there. And yet we can do this algorithmically. So to summarize here, I'm saying that algorithms are natural language for process.You could look at what I've been calling processes in biology as algorithms, not to say algorithms describe everything. They don't describe human emotions and things like that in the economy, human behavior, not that easily, but they provide another language in which we can verbs and working together. So my argument is that science itself is shifting. Science shifts.I believe when new instruments come along, literally x-ray crystallography plus the mathematics that goes with that. So suddenly by the 1950s, we can look at complicated organic molecules, 1952, 1953 DNA. And suddenly we can use this new instrument to see how they're composed and understand what they do. They're the basic components of genetics and life.And that arises out of some new instrument of understanding. As instruments of understanding come along, they bring new insights, different types of mathematics, bring different insights, geometries wonderful. And we still use it. We graph everything we can, especially in statistics and algebra is wonderful, but it's limited to quantities and amounts, and it rules largely verbs and processes.They're much harder to do verbs and processes are natural in algorithmic, what you might call algorithmic mathematics. And I think the person who understands this best connected to Santa Fe is Greg Chayton. And I've been following his work. I've known him for several decades through SFI. So it's connections with SFI that really count here. So then the proposition is this.Suppose we changed from geometry to algebra in the 1870s and on for the next hundred years or more, what does that project economics. I'd argue quite a lot. What did geometry bring, quite a lot, but probably we want to include verbs and processes and events which have been ruled out largely. Then we have to open up to thinking algorithmically and using computation.There's a lovely quote from Edsger Dijkstra, Dutch computer scientists, maybe 50 years ago or so, really smart guy. He says, if I can cut the quote right, he says, computer sciences knew more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. And I love that because basically what we're learning and I w I'm influenced here by Steve Wolfram and others.What we're learning is that algorithms occupy a whole world of their own. Turing didn't call them algorithms. He called the methods. Shannon called them algorisms. The modern word is algorithm, but then habit, a world that's infinite and a world of things changing and giving birth to things and calling in other algorithms and stopping other algorithms.This is very close to how neural processes work. I'm not saying they're perfectly algorithmic and that's a huge debate and neuroscience. But what is true is that science is shifting from an amount of this and amount of that in colored test tubes, to seeing the world, as you were pointing out in terms of things forming and not just things, forming, things that can't be fully nailed down.John Dupre is very fond of pointing out that there's no such thing as a thing that it changes over time. So even the table in your study is a process. It's changing. And I think there's a lot to be said for that point of view, but science itself is discovering a new language. You could call this computation. I don't like that term, too much about machines.We would call it algorithms. That's sort of smacks of Google and Facebook. I like the term algorithmic mathematics, which is how do you do the logical expression that makes it mathematics, including Boolean logic. And you have a language now to talk about events, processes, things unfolding as the competition works out.And those are along with conditional branching, if then conditions. So systems like this, and I think this is the essence of complexity. Complexity is about systems that are interacting with and creating their environment or their context or part of that context, and then reacting to that and thereby changing. And this may bring up new structures and this gives a language and economics for looking at structural change and formation.Michael Garfield (34m 18s): So the last thing I want to bring up with you on this call is about that structural change. Listening to you speak on this stuff, I'm reminded of Marc Andreessen's famous article, Why Software is Eating the World and the notion that our technologies and our epistemic frames are themselves evolutionary products. And, you know, we live in a world that is both informed by and sort of creating and therefore amplifying this notion that everything is an evolving process.I want to, I guess, ironically land this conversation in where it seems like this is all taking us, which is fundamental uncertainty. And hopefully by the end of this call, we can agree that what we've done in a discussion of algorithmic mathematics and its economic implications is sort of saved the future or at least save the openness of the future. And so I want to take us, or like tie a bow on this with a paper that you sent me A Comment in Nature Physics by Nicolas Gisin on how mathematical language shapes our understanding of time and physics.And again, you know, just because this conversation is so rich with historical name dropping, I think it's worth it. He starts this comment by talking about the 1922 debate between Albert Einstein and Henri Bergson, philosopher, as well as around the same time the argument between mathematician David Hilbert and L.E.J. Brouwer. You know, the notion that the physics that we're working with and living in now is akin in some respects to this kind of algebraic economic thinking.And as much as the winners of those early 20th century debates were advocating an axiomatic mathematics in which numbers are these sort of timeless platonic objects. Whereas we're starting to come back around to appreciating now that we live in a world that is computationally enriched, and capable of running these enormous simulations and making predictions we can't understand, et cetera. We're coming back around to the potential value of an Intuitionist mathematics in which numbers are themselves processes.It's much like the biological species. It seems as though it contains this eternity, like decent says in here that basically our choice is to put all of the randomness at the singularity at the big bang and then have all of the laws and characteristics of physics specified in that what Terence McKenna called the one free miracle, or we can accept that there is a finite number of information encoded in real numbers.And that there's a kind of fundamental randomness. And I'd love for you to just riff on this article that you sent me. He says, basically real numbers are marvelous tools that should not be abandoned. However, their practical use should not blind the physicists. After all their use does not force us to believe that real numbers are really real. In other words, one should not confuse the epistemological usefulness of classical mathematics with the ontology, which might well be better described by Intuitionist mathematics and in, so doing, he argues, we rescue the idea of in determinism of the openness of the future.And also we defeat the law of the excluded middle. We allow again for propositions about the future that can be somehow neither true, nor false. So it seems like what you're pointing toward here actually as part of a larger gesture in thinking about math and science and philosophy toward first of all, an epistemic humility. And then also, one in which it's not just that, cars and traffic demonstrate emergent properties, but the very bedrock of modern thinking is itself mutable and evolutionary in this way that allows us to save time itself, to restore a notion of an evolving universe to physics. W. Brian Arthur (38m 36s): Wonderful. And I think that you've answered your own question much better than that. So you have a very good understanding of this. My comment would be put it in the larger context. If you take a fairly large view of how science is developed, and I would define sciences, our attempt to understand and explain the real-world phenomenon, whether they're physical or human centered or society centered or chemical. It turns out that after that I think Newton in 1687 or whenever it was brought out such a staggering simplification of planetary orbits that could be easily explained and using for equations are so that thinkers and philosophers almost got intoxicated by those ideas. And by the 1730s and 1750s, something called the enlightenment set in very heavily best by Newton's breakthrough.And people started to think that everything in nature was explainable. I think the stanza in Alexander Pope's poem Essay on Man, 1733 is all nature is, but art meaning artifice are technicality or technique. All nature is, but art unknown to the old chance direction, which thou canst not see and so on.And basically if we only understood the basic rules and we understood that the starting point, we could predict everything. So basically from that rather simple system, and that really brilliant breakthrough of Newton’s, we began to see the world is highly ordered that only we could understand its art or its technicalities, that it would be known to us and that everything was explainable and everything was given.And possibly God given us that. And that's a platonic sort of world was justifiable that the world exists. It's given it's platonic and certainly on up to the 20th century, we assumed that if only we knew the starting conditions a la Laplace, then we could predict everything. And we knew the mechanisms. We got in for a series of shockers in the 20th century.I'm glad to say with _____ showed that there was no axiomatic that could encompass all truths in a say in number theory or in arithmetic and with quantum theory and so on, we began to realize that not everything was predictable. So I think there's been a big shift in the sciences. I'm not a philosopher, so I'm not very articulate in this, but I would say that maybe around 1900 or the first quarter of the 20th century, when David Hilbert was dominating superb mathematician, people were hoping that there was a kind of axiomatic system that would explain, or it could drive all of mathematics from that this was timeless. That a number, any number you could think of such as Pi or E were kind of given. And then there was a natural reaction against that and said, oh, how'd, you know, and people like Brouwer were saying, well, you can't really rely on things being given in a platonic universe. What you could rely on is, is there a way to construct these? Is through some algorithmic way, some constructive method whereby you can see how the digits of Pi may follow each other.Although if that's the case, you'll never know what lies at the end of PI. At any time, you might know a finite number, you know, 5 trillion digits of PI, but you don't know what lies indefinitely on the other side, you might say it exists platonically, but there's an openness in what those digits are. So people began to see mathematics and possibly physics as not being given, but as something where you had to ask what processes generate numbers, what processes bring about certain numbers, and you don't know in general, how those processes work out and the best you could say, we can have a well-timed algorithm or a well-timed method to derive those digits of PI, but we don't know exactly what they're going to be.Now, that's my take on this. We're finding similarly that you can set up in economics or indeed in physics, the rules of the game, but you can't predict in advance what those rules are going to lead to. This is famous actually. And the theory of cellular automata, and they think here, well, friends done a solid, great service. He shows that even with the various simple rules in the cellular automaton, that you don't have to get very complicated.These are systems that compute each other. They're either a lot of dots or squares that are black or white. And in the next iteration, given the squares black or white, according to some rules of what its neighbors were before. So that's a cellular automaton. And what we've learned about that is you can't predict what you're going to see in a billion or one iterations in any shorter way than just allowing that to happen.You can regard this as messy and horrible, or if you've got a different temperament, which you seem to have and I have, you can regard this as a wonder that there is no way you can think of certain rules by which the universe works or the economy works, but there's no way to see what that will lead to. When I started to investigate technology, I realized that new technologies think of say the laser printer, which is a combination of computer processor, directing and laser to write images on a Xerox drum.And so that's combination of previous technologies came along around 1972 or so in Park where I'm standing at the moment. So that's a well-defined process, but you can say, okay, in the year ten hundred or in the year, 1843, when railways were just getting underway, what's all that going to lead to. And again, you can say, well, we can't say if new technologies are created out of existing ones and those become building blocks for further technologies, we can say very far ahead, what sort of new technologies are going to arise?And when, again, it's like saying, I don't know what the future digits of Pi are going to be, no matter how many we know as some Guinness Book of Records, numbers of digits, there's an infinite we don't know and never will, because all we can say is there's a process for discovering that, but we don't know. So I'm on the side of people who say something like this, maybe the future exists somewhere.There's maybe out there there's, if you want to pause it God or something, future is known. But actually, I don't think so. I think that the future itself is being created. You might even know the processes by which it's being created in the economy, but yet you can't predict anything. Personally, I like that the architect, Robert Venturi in the 1960s was really put off by the simplicities of the Bauhaus and _________ and others saying everything has to be a minimal functional, highly ordered, highly structured, axial magic, if you like.And he detested that. So he wrote a book called something like Complexity and Modern Architecture. It wasn't talking about complex systems. He was talking about non-simplicity and he contrasted what he called prim dreams of pure order versus what he called messy vitality. And I think I'm the messy vitality camp. I like the idea.I wouldn't like the idea that if I were infinitely smart, I could switch on a detective show and predict the ending. 10 episodes hence, I like the idea that the universe is unfolding. I don't know if that answers your question, but that's roughly the best I can do.Michael Garfield (48m 58s): I guess just in closing, you know, it occurs to me that just as you are comfortable with both economics and nouns and economics and verbs, having their place, having their function or their utility, and you argue that there isn't one lens to rule them all. It seems like it's important for us not to give listeners the wrong idea here and just say, well, okay, software's going to eat the world and everything's going to be software. And the algorithms are going to win against equations.I know comparably it seems like there may be a way to at least satisfy everyone or at least mutually enrage everyone that, if you follow quantum physicists, like Yakir Aharonov or John Wheeler and the empirical evidence that they've offered that there is some sense in which we are capable of knowing at least certain details of the future or that our current observations are capable of influencing stuff in the past and here where we're well off the party line of SFI.But I think it's worth seeing that maybe perhaps in research like that, there is a way to reconcile fundamental uncertainty and indeterminacy with the notion that there is some sense, at least some details of the future are already encoded in a process-based dynamic relational way with a now that an Intuitionist mathematics restores to physics. But that we never get the infinite knowledge that allows us to do the God's eye view. In whatever sense the future exists. It is collaborating with us on the past,W. Brian Arthur (50m 43s): I would say so. The economy itself, I'm just talking about economics here, but the economy itself is vast. It could be one country like the U.S. or it could be the whole world system or continent, but the economy is vast and it's extraordinarily complicated and it's completely and utterly dependent on human behavior. And it is detailed.Fractally, you know, this happening in this industry, that's happening, these firms and the industry and these departments within firms and right down to human behavior. So the economy is an enormously complicated system and we have different ways or instruments of understanding it. We can examine history. We can examine statistics. We can do a lot of armchair theorizing and thinking through. We can do some mathematics.And up until around 1970 economic theory was regarded as all of those. And these are different instruments for looking at this enormously complicated system. So it was a bit like saying the brand is enormously complicated and we can look at it through this MRI system or some other system. The economy, we did have half a dozen, whereas that were highly respected for looking at the economy when this hyper mathmatical approach came along, partly due to Samuelson and others, I can respect it.But I do remember, I'm old enough to remember where it was controversial. Now it's taken over and people seem to assume that the only way to theorize about the economy is to do it in equation form using what amounts to fairly, not terribly advanced mathematics that, but good mathematics that's led to a lot of insight and a lot of cleaning up of the logic, but it only shows you certain things the way x-rays show you certain things about the sun rather than some other method.So I think that what I'd like to see is respect for many ways of looking at the economy, including armchair inside the historical comparison, statistics, mathematics itself, algebraic analysis, and now something else, which is a new form of mathematics, algorithmic mathematics, or looking in terms of logical formalized processes.But none of these can capture an actual economy. It's like saying, you know, you've a friend or a spouse, and you could say, what's their personality. Well, it could put that into a Myers Briggs system or some other system Jungian analysis, but you will never know the complication of that person. And personally, I cheer that on. So the bottom line here is that I would like to see standard mathematics treated as one very good way to look at the economy, but it looks in terms of things, things that are interrelated and objects that grow or not grow.Now, we've another one. We have a computational economics, or I prefer to think of it as algorithmic theory. And that shows you different things. So you can say that over a couple of centuries, ago from geometry to algebra, algebra added onto geometry, but it didn't replace it totally. And I think algorithmic thinking, thinking in terms of processes and in terms of interacting events, illuminates things that we couldn't look at earlier and it adds on, so it's not going to replace the previous methods of doing theory.I would like to use a word. I'd like to have a Catholic approach. I don't mean religious, I mean a wide approach. So yes, we will look statistically. Yes, we can look algebraically and yeah let's experiment and see how these systems work, systems that create new things and endogenously. So let's have a look at how algorithmically the economy works.We'll see different things. We've got a wider view, but I don't think there's ever any end view. And I hope not of fully understanding an economy. In fact, the science keeps changing, and this is true in physics as the instruments of understanding change, be they're mathematical or mechanistic, then the science changes, then the understanding changes. And I don't think there's an insight here and I hope not.Michael Garfield (56m 7s): Wonderful. So just maybe this is, I don't know, maybe we leave this out, but it just occurs to me in describing this open-ended recombinant approach to scientific methods. We're developing this syntax, like an integrated pluralistic approach. And that begs the question. If we're moving from nouns to verbs, like what comes next? Adverbs That almost gets back to more like a Goethen kind of science of properties, of things, you know, like a weaving the observer back in a more formal and rigorous way.W. Brian Arthur (56m 50s): Well, in an unusual, bout of humility to simply say, I don't know, but I think it's wonderful note to know that with complexity economics that was really started at Santa Fe and now become a very large approach. We're basically assuming that the economy is not deterministic, highly ordered probabilistic, but it's actually, there's fundamental uncertainty, but we can model how people proceed with fundamental uncertainty.Like I'm about to go for lunch. I don't know what will be there for lunch, but don't worry. I'll figure something out. So we can model that. And no small part actually, thanks to my colleague, John Holland, who was very much an influence on me and other people at Santa Fe Institute. We can just, as if you're training some algorithm and AlphaGo is started off just knowing rules, but not knowing how to operate, you can learn.And that's how people do learn. Maybe not exactly in AI or machine learning terms, but there are well-known ways been studied people learn from past events and so on. So what I'm cheering on is the idea that we're backing off from seeing the economy as a highly ordered predictable system with this and that form of perfection. And we're backing off from that to seeing the economy is in the longer term is not very knowable, but to quite a degree, understandable. It's more a sort of seeing the economy as a friend, rather than as a machine.The economy is an organism that keeps changing and morphing. I like that, but some people might find that's an uncomfortable view. You're trying to understand more of it. I don't think we will ever fathom the economy just as we will never fathom what makes music music. We can say, well, it's due to this or that, but it goes on forever. Literature's the same. These are all attempts if you ask me a few human beings to illustrate their worlds, to make it real, to tell stories about it. And I think that all of theory is a story. It's what's the story of planetary orbits? How do they arise? How do they get there? Now we're looking at stories that, of how things form, not just how things are. And so personally, I like that.And how did planetary systems come about? What happens when a supernova explodes? How did the whole system of molecular biology arise? All of this complicated. How did brains in mammals arise? These are not fully explained. Probably never will be, but we are shifting from looking at ordered mechanical systems to looking at systems that are fundamentally unknowable, fundamentally uncertain, but we can say a lot of things about them.Nevertheless. So rather than say some system like competitions, replacing standard mathematicians I hope it's not. I would prefer to say we have a new form of telescope. We have a new form of microscope and that is looking at things algorithmically. How do these events affect those events? What can you say? So it's a wonderful world. I wish I were 40 years younger, but it's fun to be in on the start of this. I think is very much a Santa Fe Institute view of the world.I hope so. Anyway, meaning exploratory and not taking a given method for granted.Michael Garfield (1h 1m 6s): Well, I mean, it certainly seems that we've graduated from the reputation that SFI had sort of engendered in the nineties as participating in this grand search for a theory of everything. It seems like we've backed up off of that. We're not willing to die on that hill anymore. It's hopeful. W. Brian Arthur (1h 1m 26s): I remember that era. I was there for all of its since 1987. I remember the key person who was responsible for a lot of that too. We'll be nameless. I'm sure you know who he is. And yeah, I think what we're doing is there are many ways to define complexity, but I would just simply say, we're looking at systems that can endogenously create new structures based upon the structures and contexts that they've created themselves.And that keeps going on. And, I think it's alive and it's wonderful, but it's not the last word. There never will be a last word. I hope.Michael Garfield (1h 2m 14s): Well, I'll give you the last word on that one.W. Brian Arthur (1h 2m 18s): Thank you.Michael Garfield (1h 2m 19s): Thank you so much for being back on the show and folks, if you like this, check the show notes, we linked all the papers and we'll link to the first two episodes with Brian as well in which we look at how this stuff actually applies to economic thinking in a bit more detail.

69,Episode Details / Transcript Lightly-edited machine transcription by podscribe.ai + Aaron Leventman Lauren Klein (0s): There are other ways to think about abstraction or what can be perceived at scale, then just the zooming out and viewing from a distance. We have all sorts of concepts that are macro or that describe macro phenomenon. So we have the idea of like the collective versus the individual. We have ideas about invisible abstract or collective labor, as opposed to the like hard, tangible labor that is rewarded by deposit in your baking account kind of thing.  If we think more capaciously about what our methods can do, if we sort of think beyond this metaphor of distance scale, as we know, operates on multiple dimensions in the same way, our critical lenses can also take these multi-dimensional approaches. Then we might think of other things to do with these quantitative methods, again, that compliments that extend beyond just sort of zooming out and saying, okay, here's the aggregate view of what these books are saying  Michael Garfield (1m 24s): When British scientists and novelist C.P. Snow describe the sciences and humanities as two cultures in 1959, it wasn't a statement of what could or should be, but a lament over the sorry state of Western societies fractured intellectual life. Over 60 years later, the costs of this fragmentation are even more pronounced and dangerous, but advances in computing now make it possible for historians and engineers to speak in one another's languages, catalyzing novel insights in each other's home domains.  And in so doing the academics working at these intersections, have illuminated hidden veins in history, the unsung influence and cultural significance of those who didn't write the victor's stories. Their lives and work come into focus when we view them with the aid of analytic tools, which change our understanding of the stories we've inherited and the shape of power in our institutions. One strain of the digital humanities called Data Feminism helps bring much needed rigor to textual study. At the same time, it reintroduces something crucial to a deeper reconciliation of the disciplines, a human who, and how to compliment what we have inherited as fact. Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute.  I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week, we talked to Emory University researcher, Lauren Klein, coauthor of the MIT press volume Data Feminism. In part one of our two-part conversation, we discuss how her work leverages the new toolkit of quantitative literary studies and transforms our understanding of historical dynamics, not just in the past, but those inaction as we speak.

Well, Lauren Klein, it's a pleasure to have you on complexity podcast,  Lauren Klein (4m 21s): So happy to be here.  Michael Garfield (4m 24s): So I like to start these conversations by inviting you to talk a little bit about your own background, your biography, what animates you in your research, how you came to the passions that you explore as a scholar and how you got mixed up in this, I guess.  Lauren Klein (4m 44s): Yeah, that's a good question. So I like to say, and because I think my research brings together computational and critical approaches to data to data science and to data's history. And I really pride myself on a syncretic approach, one that isn't sort of an either or, but really is trying to bring things together and to be able to speak to scholars and honestly just nerds on the internet in both of these areas in ways that are allegeable to them and that are meaningful to them.  And, you know, this came about rather kind of through a long path. I went to college and the rise of the first dot com era. So the internet was new email was new. Anyone can make a website and I just was captivated and in college taught myself a lot of stuff. I took a lot of CS classes when I graduated. I worked at a series of dot coms that each sort of imploded and kind of spectacular ways.  And then I sort of had a reactionary response and it was like computers can't trust them. You can trust books. And so I went to grad school in English and actually pursued a pretty traditional English PhD. My area of focus was early American literature. My dissertation was quite literary, quite historicist. And just as I was finishing grad school, I heard about this emerging field called Digital Humanities, which we know what that is now, but I didn't know what it was then.  And I was like, “Hey, this is the thing that I've been looking for.” I always thought I had to choose between technical work and literary analysis and here's this field which lets me do both. And I just threw myself into it. I should say I was also really lucky. I mean, it was also a matter of timing. Right now the job market is a lot different, a lot harder. And someone like me who was just feeling their way through at the time that I was beginning my professional career, like I wouldn't be hireable at this moment, but I was just really lucky.  And so I got, you know, this first job at Georgia Tech, which again was a place where I think that's cretic approach was valued. It's an engineering school, but I was teaching in the humanities. But in order to teach humanities courses to engineers, you need to figure out a way to bridge those two disciplines. And I was ready and eager to do that. And now I'm at Emory and in some ways I'm doing sort of the inverse, trying to figure out how these technical and quantitative methods can be brought back to the humanities for students who either are interested in them or might not know yet that they're interested in them.  So that's sort of been the shape of my career to date. Yeah. I don't know what else do you want to know?  Michael Garfield (7m 36s): No, I mean, that's great. I was really pleased to see your work because even though at SFI, we take this real hard line about our particular strain of transdisciplinarity which is focused on rigorous quantitative research. There's really not a lot of qualitative stuff going on here, but nonetheless, as we'll get into in this call, it's rather tricky in many cases to coax out of a quantitative approach, certain, very obvious and relevant things about our lives as human beings.  And so seeing you square the circle, I found really interesting and inspiring. And so I'm glad that we get to talk about this. Maybe the first place to dive in here is actually the book that you authored with Catherine D’Ignacio. You have an MIT press book, Data Feminismin these strong ideas series. And I'd love to hear you just lay out for folks unfamiliar with your work, what we're talking about when we talk about data feminism.  And I think that that gives us a springboard into a little bit more of a granular examination of what you've been doing with this.  Lauren Klein (8m 57s): Data feminism put really plainly, it's an approach to thinking about data and data science that's informed by feminism and by intersectional feminism in particular. And what we take from that is both this sort of fundamental belief that there should be equality in the world and that that equality has not yet been realized. And so part of the commitment of feminism is not just a sort of imagine the world you want to live in, but also to take steps to make that a reality.  But I would say on a more sort of theoretical level, the book really epitomizes, like I said, the kinds of things that I love to do, which is take theories from one field, or it doesn't have to be serious, but in this case, it is, and show how they have really broad and relevant applicability to a field that might not have seen that yet. And so what we do is we take a lot of conceptual approaches, theoretical structures, examples of actions from feminism really broadly conceived and show how actually these ideas and principles have very direct relevance on data science and in particular to these problems of bias systems, discriminatory algorithms, missing data, all of these ideas, which actually when we started writing the book, I think not that many people were talking about except the people who they were impacting directly. And now actually thanks to the work of not just us, but a lot of amazing scholars in this field, Joy Buolamwini, Margaret Mitchell, Ruha Benjamin. And you're like, I could go on and on, but there's this real, I think cohort of scholar activists, who are trying to redress these harms.  And so that's what we try to do in the book.  Michael Garfield (10m 40s): So to that point, and I think it might, it seems like there's a shift that people need to make here, especially maybe if you're an American. I was just talking with Visiting Scholar, Julia Lefkovitz, yesterday on campus about her work on the difference between American and French journalism and how American journalistic integrity cleaves to this performance of objectivity. Whereas in France, a lot of really excellent, solid journalistic work is very open about the position of the author in a way that would make it look like a mirror opinion piece, quote unquote, to an American audience, and yet by a clued cluing, the author and the stance of the author and the contextual embedding of who's actually doing the research, be it journalistic or academic, you're actually leaving out really, really important information, readdressing the who and the how, and rather than just like pretending, like we're just offering these objective whats when we present claims about the world, seems like an important piece of this.  Lauren Klein (11m 60s): That seems that's such a smart observation. And I appreciate the analogy to journalists. And then actually I should say my co-author Katherine of Data Feminism has a background in journalism. She was teaching data visualization in a journalism department for a lot of years before she went to MIT. But I think that really is what I would say is a fundamental tenant of feminism. And actually there's another helpful phrase. I'll get back to that in a minute. But you know, Ruha Benjamin, who I was just mentioning has this great book called Race After Technology and in it, she talks about imagined objectivity, which is the ideal version of objectivity that we all wish could exist.   Of course as people who pride themselves on rigorous research, valid research, producing results that we can bear weight. We all wish that we could achieve some sort of objective stance or scope on any particular problem. But the reality is that no one can achieve that. There is no such thing as just like pure idealized objectivity. And the response to that, and this is where the feminism come in, the response to that is not to just like throw up your hands and say, we can't trust science, or we shouldn't do research or our results are invalid or everything is relative.Like that's what the people coming to this argument in bad faith might say, but rather we need to embrace all of this contextual information, as you were just saying the who and the what and the why that surrounds our work so that it can inform our work. And the end result is this leads to better science because we're more aware of the position from which we launch your inquiries, whatever, the perspective that we bring to that particular project, what we choose to focus on, what we decide is not especially important or salient at that particular moment, the national political social position from which we launch our inquiries which may lead us to focus on certain issues and minimize other issues. All of these things inform our work. They don't invalidate our work, but actually if we can make them tractable or even just articulate them, they let us place our research in a broader frame. And ultimately this leads to a better sense of how far we can to what ends we can apply our results, how far they'll hold to what populations in what contexts. And then it also limits us from either over-applying them, misapplying them injecting potential harms that we didn't foresee, all of this, again, this is what folks like Sandra Harding, Donna Haraway, these sort of early feminists theorists of science and technology would say, this is feminist objectivity. This is objectivity plus because it's everything we know from research and it's everything that we bring in from the outside. Michael Garfield (14m 56s): So you led directly where I wanted to go with this, which is in some discussion about a piece that you wrote about dimensions of scale, invisible labor editorial work in the future of quantitative literary studies. So this piece really touches on something that I find comes up on the show a lot. I actually came up on the last show that we just released with Stefani Crabtree and Devin White talking about using agent-based modeling and GIS to try and reconstruct likely migration pathways into the peopling of what is now like the Australian continent. And they were talking about how, if you try to model a minimal effort, migratory route, then you're missing important details at the ground level of how people actually see and navigate their environment and like the way that they identify specific landmarks and natural features as sacred and like this whole human dimension, which as you quote in your piece “As Donna Haraway has observed the technology of distance, often obscures non-dominant perspectives.” And this seems like something that people get stuck on a lot, because I think complexity science in particular has this legacy or this reputation of being about trying to find a single unifying theory of everything like a totalizing framework in which we can make all these universal claims, but it strikes me that what it's really more about, or how it has matured is about being able to fluidly navigate through scales to be as comfortable in the quote unquote micro and to allow it to exist on its own terms, with respect to the macro, rather than seeing like higher levels of organization emerging out of lower levels. And like all of these aren't really effective. So, I'm just gonna rant on this a little bit more and then toss it back to you and allow you to unpack this some with your work. But like you give this beautiful example of how Ted Underwood in Distant Horizons and describing his interest in exploring the sweep of long timelines. Analogizes the insights prompted by this perspective to how the curve of the horizon only becomes visible some distance above the earth. But when you look at work like that, work that zooms out as far as possible and finds these regularities that there are always exceptions, like Jevin West's work on the scaling laws and how human beings are an outlier in this like clean graph that we make of like all of the mammals and how much energy we require. And like, meanwhile, humans are actually using like orders of magnitude more energy than you would expect for a mammal of our size. So it's like, there's something in escapable as far as like our human existence is concerned that we not simply kinda like dissociate to this orbital view. And so you make a really solid case in this for moving beyond, not just the access that I described, not just this close and distant reading, but like bringing them together, remixing, adding additional axes.  I would love to have you go into some detail about how exactly you're doing this in this particular piece of research on Mary Shadd and Lydia Marie Child and their work as editors. And then from there, I think we can kind of open it up into the discussion of what the study of invisible labor implies or how that changes the way that we're thinking about things more broadly. Okay. That was a mouth full. Lauren Klein (18m 48s): No, no, no. I appreciate that framing beause I think that once again, it's kind of the point, like it's always a “both and.” We can learn a lot about culture about society writ large when we do take that sort of zooming back view and really try to grasp the whole as we can see it in its abstract form. But I think that there's a little bit of an inside baseball argument that's embedded in that essay that I don't know how legible it will be to non-literary scholars or scholars who have spent a long time in this field of digital humanities. So maybe I'll just frame it a little bit. So the most famous proponent of these computational approaches to literature, which is where my research practice, a lot of where my research practice sits, this Franco Moretti and he coined this phrase distant reading. And it's very evocative. You hear it. And you almost immediately understand as opposed to close reading. What I will do is instead of reading the book, I will zoom out and try to aggregate or abstract so that I can see large patterns in this literature when it's treated as data. And the fruits have been born out in work by Ted Underwood and works by Richard Soe, there have been really amazing and interesting claims that have been made and findings that have been uncovered that tell us new things about literature, but the sort of the inside baseball argument that I make there, there are other ways to think about abstraction or what can be perceived at scale than just the zooming out and viewing from a distance. We have all sorts of concepts that are macro or that describe macro phenomenon. So we have the idea of like the collective versus the individual. We have the idea of what is when I talk about in the paper ideas about invisible abstract or collective labor, as opposed to the like hard, tangible labor that is rewarded by deposit in your banking account kind of thing. Conceptually, what I was trying to do in that paper, aside from the individual example was say, if we think more capacious about what our methods can do, if we sort of think beyond this metaphor of distance, and we think more in terms of scale, as we know, operates on multiple dimensions in the same way, our critical lenses can also take these multidimensional approaches. Then we might think of other things to do with these quantitative methods that again, that compliments that extend beyond just sort of zooming out and saying, okay, here's the aggregate view of what these books are saying? And I believe that with all of my core, I think that, and I will also say like, I don't have the best ideas about what to do next. I think that we have thought fairly narrowly about what computational approaches to texts can do in large part because of this conceptual framing. And I'm really eager to see what the next generation of scholars think of when they allow themselves to bring in additional conceptual models, additional ideas from other disciplines.  I think we'll just start to just learn so much more. Do you want me to get into a little bit about the details of the paper at this point? Where do you want to go? Michael Garfield (22m 9s): Yes, definitely. So specifically like surfacing invisible editorial work through topic modeling.Lauren Klein (22m 18s): So the paper I said a while ago, So my area of expertise is American literature. I focus in particular on the early Republic, but really up until the civil war is like in my wheelhouse. And I'm really an increasingly interested in the relationships among activists within the abolitionist movement. And I'm interested in abolition and folks listening will start to very soon make the connections to the present, but this was this historical, immensely important social movement.It led to the abolition of slavery in the United States. Arguably it's the most important social movement maybe ever, but it was accomplished by a multiracial coalition of people, including black activists and white activists. It was multi-gender. There were leading women abolitionists at a time when most professional spaces were dominated by white men. So it's this really interesting mix of perspectives coming together. And it's also super interesting to me because, and this is true almost of any social movement ever, everyone agreed about the end goal.Everyone agreed that slavery is reprehensible. It needs to be abolished, but within the movement and some people even disagree that it could be called a single movement there was intense disagreement about how to accomplish that goal. And so you can think even today about the various proponents within the U.S. government is right, do we try to become more moderate so that we can bring more broad support to some core set of concerns or, since the issue of human freedom is on the line, is there no room for a moderation.And those are both very valid perspectives that people can have on any issue. Do we just burn it to the ground because this is a flawed democracy or do we try to rebuild it? These are debates that we hear with respect to black lives matter right now, with respect to conversations about defunding the police, even about the infrastructure bill. I don't know when this will air, but all of these ideas about how political change happens, you know, these are still, these are open issues, right? No one really knows there we're still working them out. And so that's just sort of a long way of saying that I'm really interested in how these dynamics play it out historically conveniently for me, many of these dynamics, not all. And we can talk about that later, but many of them are documented in these abolitionists newspapers, which were in effect the social media of their day. They were published often weekly, sometimes monthly, but mostly weekly in all sorts of regions, they were circulated and shared. They were editors read each other's work. They often reprinted editorials, or even news items that they agreed with as a sign of endorsement. And so it's this really networks textual record that describes a lot of what this movement was up to. And this is ineffective. It's big textual data and that this is exactly the kind of archive as I would call it that I think can open itself up to really interesting new findings when we approach it at scale. And so one of the interesting things that I was looking at in the paper had to do with the editorial work that was invested by different editors.Because you can read these newspapers, you can read them now, you can go to an archive. You could, they actually, some of them not actually a very small percentage of them have actually been preserved, but you can read them if you want. Many of them have been digitized. You can recreate the process of what it was like to read them at their own time. You can also read countless scholarly accounts of what happened both broadly with respect to the abolitionist movement and in particular, with respect to these newspapers. And yet there are also things that we do not know or are difficult to perceive about these newspapers using extent, critical skills. And one of them that really struck me in part because of my own work as an editor, was this idea of what were the editors doing? We know that every week they sat down with these clippings from other newspapers, with their ideas in their own head, with their pen and paper, with their type, because often at this very, very small teams of people who were doing everything from writing, editing, selling, compositing, printing, lthese are small operations. I mean, this was so much work that we were doing and we can see the end result in these newspapers, but there's so much that's missing there about the intellectual labor and other forms of labor, I'll get there in a minute, that had to be invested in order to produce this weekly output. And I was just wondering like, what else could we say about that? How else could we honor that work? Is there a way to not recover the thinking because you can't really do that.  But I was just sort of wondering what else could we do to make this editorial work tractable and legible and sort of make it matter in new ways. And part of this, I would say, is inspired by, I did a lot of archival work at the New York Public Library for this project, reading letters, by these editors where they complained about how hard it was. They're like I spent so much time fixing the typos and these other people's newspapers. And then this other newspaper wants me to shove in this anecdote. And like, I wish I could be writing editorials, but I don't have the time to do it. Lydia Maria Child, one of the authors who I, the editors rather who I write about has this letter where she says, “I have three editorials written in my mind, but I haven't had time to write them down.” And so there's like the editor saying, I was thinking of these things. I just couldn't do them. They're not on the page. And so I was just really interested, like where could quantitative approaches come in here? And where this took me was to topic modeling, combined with some measures from information theory, but trying to say, okay, like topic modeling is really good at summarizing content. It gives us this like slightly larger, larger view. You're not at the level of the individual article or the level of the sentence, or even the page. It tells us what were the themes that were being discussed in these papers. And you can aggregate them. You could rank them, you can sort them. And what I did in the paper was try to say, okay, in addition to topic, there are some measures from information theory that allow us to identify not only the most dominant topic, like what topic constituted the majority of this newspaper, which P.S., by the way, in all of them is like abolition.There's a topic that has like slaved freedom, servitude, liberty. Like you look at that and you're like, okay, this is a topic about slavery. And that of course is the number one topic and all of them, but what is the most uniquely significant topic for each newspaper and for each newspaper editor. So if we had to try to identify a theme that was sort of the mark or the hand of this editors intervention, what would that topic be? And in some cases, in my analysis, we find things that confirm what we know. So Lydia Maria Child, who I've already mentioned, she was a really prolific author writer, editor, abolitionist. She was brought on as editor in order to attract more women to the cause. She had previously published a cookbook. And so we can see some of the topics that are distinctive about her editorial tenure do have to do with clothing, with dress, with food, with recipes, sort of these domestic issues. And again, we have on the record, William Lloyd Garrison and famous abolitionists saying, I want her because I think she could bring in the women. And later on, she goes on about how she tried to do that. And she actually got pushback from some people who thought she was being too moderate. So that confirms known findings. That's great. It's proof that the model holds weight. But then one of the really interesting things that turned up was that I was looking at this newspaper called the Provincial Freeman. This was a newspaper edited by a black woman, Mary Ann Shadd. She married later, became Mary Ann Shadd Cary. And at the time she also wrote about her travails and editing this newspaper, felt that as a woman and as a black woman, she was unduly criticized for her activist positions. She felt like, and not felt like she actually did. There was going on the record, people saying maybe you should tone it down a little bit, try to get more readers before you push them away with your radical politics. And she was like, I'm not here for this. Again, human freedom is on the line and this is what it takes. And so interestingly, when you look at the topics that characterize her newspaper, you don't just get these domestic topics, the same as the white woman editor, although that's there. But you also get topics that have to do with like travel with the European politics, with the natural landscape. It's just this really capacious view of what freedom would entail once achieved. And this, again, you know, this was really interesting to see, because it tracks some recent scholarship. I'm thinking of folks like Derrek Spires and this amazing work of the Colored Conventions Project who have done a lot of work to say, look, you know, when white people envision emancipation, they envision legal emancipation. For them slavery, the opposite of slavery is, I declare you free, but for the black people who were enslaved, it's not just legal emancipation, it's ability to thrive, it's ability to access to opportunity.  You know, all of the things that living means. And, sure, this comes with legal emancipation, but it also means economic justice, educational justice, social justice, ability to practice your religion, all of these things. And so I saw this in this newspaper and that felt really meaningful to me in large part because Shadd herself had been so vilified really, you know, people were not coming to her for her radical politics for her attempt at radical world making or remaking. And then here it was in these topics that was long and rambly. But anyway, I think that's like, that's the heart of this. Michael Garfield (32m 18s): Well, first of all, long and rambly is how we do things on the show. You're right at home. But a couple of things come up for me in reading this and in listening to you talk about it and you know, it's my onus to link out to other strains of complex systems research. And so just riffing on how I see rhymes in your work and rhymes and the work of other people. One is this issue of changes and information architecture, and how it's widely analogized. Like you just did, that social media and pamphlets have this relationship. And when we're looking at major changes in power structures in society, the work comes in from the margins, which is related to that a lot of really important quote unquote sense-making is being done in these largely uncredentialed forms of communication because the society just hasn't caught up yet to finding ways to encode expertise in these new media. And this is related to work that Albert Kao and Mirta Galesic and former External Professor, Carl Bergstrom, and a bunch of other people did with Joe Bak-Coleman at the University of Washington recently on the paper about stewardship of global collective behavior and how they're really arguing that quantitative social science about the impact of social media and other new digital forms is a crisis discipline now. It's so important that we figure this out and then you didn't actually come out and say this per se, but like the term that you alluded to, as an information theory concept is appoint wise mutual information quantifying the degree association between a specific feature and a category. This reminds me a lot about using genomics to trace horizontal info transfers through networks. So like just like the relatively recent scientific discovery that rabbits in the laboratory are actually absorbing genes through their gut bacteria and into themselves through the food that they're eating. Speaker 1 (34m 34s): I believe that. That's so nutty. Michael Garfield (34m 37s): Hypothetically, we're doing this too. And so this kind of thinking spills into the sense of the self as nested networks embedded within networks. And I see my strong rhyme between the work that you're doing in this particular inquiry and this sort of broader paradigmatic shift that is brought about by complex systems research where intersectional feminism and the non-human, or post-human turn. Donna Haraway, you already mentioned, Katherine Hayles and these other people are involved in. So it's like in a way there's something about like seeing the human being as a holobiont, you know, in which your gut bacteria are playing an important part in the regulation of your brain activity and this kind of thing seems very much akin to the patterns that you're describing and society. And the way that all of this historically invisible labor is actually contributing to these major transitions in the way that we relate to one another such that the story is I, the self-authoring modern agents, this bound self and making a decision, and now we've moved beyond that. And we have say, actually, I am deeply vulnerable to and influenced by all of these other agents that until very recently in ecology and evolutionary biology are getting no credit whatsoever. So you've got like, you know, Michael Levin and Dan Dennett talking about cognition going all the way down. And in both cases we're seeing quote unquote the tail wagging the dog. Lauren Klein (36m 16s): I appreciate that observation. I think you're right to identify this belief that I think is consistent across all of my research that ideas happen, change happens, culture forms from the outside in, and that we learn more about a culture by trying to identify and examine and explore the work on the periphery, or that's been placed on the periphery by these dominant power structures rather. It wasn't actually on the periphery at the time at all, like was actually the dominant culture, but that my approach in general, and this is true in my eyes are purely humanistic work, as opposed to, in addition to some of my more technical work that I think that's where the interesting ideas are, that's where the complexity lies. Like that's what makes people people, and there's a lot of different residences with different approaches to feminism feminists on, I mean, you mentioned a little bit earlier black feminism, and you could easily trace this or thinking like this to Patricia Hill Collins and this idea of the four different domains she had described. She's formulating this in relationship to oppression. She has this idea called the matrix of domination, but she sort of atomizes the LT Syrian power structure and a little bit more specificity and places, a lot of emphasis on the hegemonic domain, which is system and of culture, as well as the interpersonal domain, which is how in her case oppression affects people. But this is true in general about how cultural forces impact people and shape a culture. She also has really interesting ideas about what she calls subjugated knowledge on this idea that we have cultural authorities and outlets that authorize certain types of people to tell certain types of stories and certain registers and anyone who doesn't fit into that particular place gets subjugated. They're forced out of the newspaper of record. They're forced out of the formal mode of speaking, and therefore it becomes this vicious cycle where their knowledge becomes subjugated or deprecated, but obviously it's not knowledge. In fact, this is where most of the thinking takes place and it's sort of our work. And I believe this especially as someone who looks back on the past and I would say also like as a white scholar, who is trying to account for the ways in which white scholars have written history and have silenced or minimized the contributions of nonwhite people to all of these social movements that are so central to the country's founding, like it's our job to amplify those and to sort of bring those into the center in the ways that we know how to do it, whether it's through the particular techniques that I apply or really anyone else's work. Michael Garfield (39m 8s): So because your child has interrupted this call, and I think that like before we started, we were talking about the effects of the pandemic on exposing the invisible labor of parenting. And again, a link out to Aaron Clauset at SFI and his co-author Alison Morgan at CU Boulder and the work that they've done on just like how antagonistic the academic system is to parents, the lack of understanding, support funding, the incentive structure of this publish or perish thing, where if somebody has a kid, they fall behind, and so this is an enormous problem when we consider that the majority of scholars are parents above the age of 40. I would love to hear you talk a little bit about this in terms of like the consequences of making labor visible and of coming to a more kind of complete and human understanding. And then maybe not to put you on the spot with this, but it does seem again to rhyme with work that David Wolpert has been doing on thermodynamics speed limits. So total curve ball here, but like his idea in stochastic thermodynamics, there's this notion of the Landauer Bound, which is sort of like the minimum amount of energy required to process information. And we just sort of assume that that is that's the floor. That's the speed limit that we can reach with computer systems, but we'll, it's been decomposing systems into their subsystems. And one of his coauthors for Farita Tasnim at MIT just came and spoke at SFI about this only to it in the show notes about how, when you actually look at the individual contributions of those subsystems in a circuit that the speed limit is actually much higher because the whole thing is only as fast as the slowest components. And so, in a way, the computer science conversation seems to be reaching kind of similar conclusions to the data feminism conversation about the invisible contributions of a circuit within a larger circuit, and how actually we have these ideas about what the economy is capable of. But it's based on this nonsense about like we've assumed a spherical cow, we've assumed academics that don't have families, we've assumed a warehouse workers that don't need to take bathroom breaks. And so I would love to just invite you to speculate a little bit about what happens when we make the shift and in what ways that sort of like intention with our need for speed as a society and like the efficiencies of economies of scale and so on. Lauren Klein (42m 10s): There's a lot there. First of all, I'm glad to hear that you think that computer science has heated this cautionary tale, because I feel like from my perspective, they're still modeling cows as spheres and compartmentalizing and reducing the complexity of our lives, but maybe that's the beacon of hope. I mean, I think, again, this comes back to what I was saying before about the value of multiple perspectives and the value of not just human perspectives, but the value of approaching things from different timeframes, from different scales. I think no one would argue that for example, scholarship that takes more time is often more thought through, a little bit deeper, more nuanced in its language, more precise than us argumentation. We can't always take forever on everything to your point about academic time skills and their rigidity, but we learn, there is such a thing as like just-in-time research, especially like I'm thinking, you know, of Joe Gulity, for example, who I know is a SFI Affiliate, who's done really interesting work arguing for the need for really fast scholarship and response to climate change because we are living in a climate emergency. We don't have the time to wordsmith and perfect everything. And we just like, get it out there and make change now. But there's also additional, again, not competitive with, but like complimentary scholarship that happens over a long time span when you have time to synthesize, to sit with, to sort of meditate on what the larger impact could be. And we need an academy which makes space for all of this. Another place where this comes up a lot is discussions of participatory design and just community oriented research where academic timescales are such that you often don't have time to build a really good relationship with the community partner before like your grant runs out or you need to get tenure or your RA graduates, or, whatever the constraints make the courses over, whatever the constraints may be. And yet we know that human relationships and meaningful relationships take time to build, and there's not really space in academic incentive or reward structure is too, I would say an academic reward structures to incentivize this type of slow relationship building work. And so the scholars who I think make meaningful relationships with communities and therefore do the more impactful work, usually that comes at the expense of merit increase at the end of the year or their promotion or whatever. So that's another example of how now we really do need more flexibility, but again, I may seem that sound like a broken record, but I think this is true, just because certain research fast and certain or research is slow, or certain processes are fast and certain processes are slow it doesn't mean that you can't have people doing both kinds of things, or even the same person doing both kinds of things at the same time. And we absolutely do need an academy that recognizes that there's not only one way to have impact. There's not only one way to produce transformative research. There's all these different ways that we can do it. And that like all are necessary, right. And all are valuable. Michael Garfield (45m 28s): So to that point, it seems like a good opportunity to pivot into this other piece that you coauthored with Sandeep Soni and Jacob Eisenstein, abolitionists networks, modeling language change in 19th century activist newspapers.  Thank you for listening. Complexities produced by the Santa Fe Institute, a nonprofit hub for complex systems science located in the high desert of New Mexico.

70,Episode Details / Transcript Transcript by http://podscribe.ai (machine draft) + Aaron Leventman (human edit)Lauren Klein (0s): Anyone who works with data knows, data is created by people. Data are created by people, if you want to be pedantic about it. And because they are created by people, they necessarily involve choices about what to count, what not to count, what to classify, what not to classify, what to include, what not to include. And then there's also a whole separate set of issues about the impact of the data. What is the capture of this data? Who does it impact? Who does it potentially harmed? What is the analysis of this data?What is the impact? Who does it potentially harm? You need to be thinking about human impacts, always.Michael Garfield (60s): Where does cultural innovation come from? Histories often simplify the complex shared work of creation into tales of great men and their visionary genius, but ideas have precedence and moments, and it takes two different kinds of person to have and to hype them. The popularity of influencers past and present obscures the collaborative social processes by which ideas are born and spread. What can new tools for the study of historical literature tell us about how languages evolve and what might a formal understanding of innovation change about the ways we work together. Welcome to Complexity, the official podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. I'm your host, Michael Garfield, and every other week, we'll bring you with us for far ranging conversations with our worldwide network of rigorous researchers, developing new frameworks to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe. This week, we conclude our two-part conversation with Emory University researcher, Lauren Klein, coauthor with Katherine D'Ignazio of the MIT Press Volume Data Feminism.We talk tracing change in language use with topic modeling the role of randomness in data feminism and what this work ultimately does, and does not say about the hidden seams of power in society.

I remember when you spoke for your SFI seminar, I asked if you were applying this kind of modeling approach to contemporary corpora, trying to trace otherwise invisible contributions of like the lower decks uncelebrated employees in modern workforces. And similarly I'm reminded of work that Jack O’Shaw, who just joined us as a fellow has done with our VP of Science, Jennifer Dunne, on trying to use food, web reconstruction to identify gaps in the fossil record. Clearly something isn't fossilizing here because we can see that there's an enormous metabolic contribution coming from this lacuna in the food web. Could you talk a little bit about this because I think we've already touched on some of the stuff that you explore in this paper, but I'd love to hear you unpack it a little for us.Lauren Klein (3m 40s): So this paper, it's good that it comes out of this conversation about slow academic scholarship, because this is one of the end results of a very long collaboration between myself and Jacob Eisenstein. We both arrived at Georgia Tech the same year in 2013, and he's now at Google, but it took almost that entire time in order to identify the corpus, prepare the corpus, cleaned the corpus, clean it again, figure out what methods would yield, things that were meaningful, but the more conceptually speaking, this is another project that tries to get at some of these themes again, really sort of bring together a lot of the work that I do, which has to do with unacknowledged labor, with the paths by which change and political change in particular takes place. And then who was rewarded or recognized for that change in the outset. So what we actually do is we go back to this newspaper corpus, the same that I used for that earlier paper, but we look at language at the level of individual words, and we try to find who or which newspaper was responsible for innovating a change in meaning, a new meaning, but more likely as we found a change in meaning of a particular word.So you could think a little bit, how does one of the things that I'll give an example from the paper? So the word justice at the beginning of the corpus in like 1820 really has this narrow legal definition. If you look at the words that are most similar to the word justice, you get discussions of laws and rights and the political and legal system, but by midway through the corpus, and certainly by the end, there's been this inflection where justice has taken on these more capacious connotations, like citizenship, like rights, like freedom.This is really interesting and it's compelling again because it tracks what I was talking about before a lot of the work that's been done to show how the abolitionists movement wasn't only about achieving legal emancipation for people who have been enslaved, but we're also redefining what it meant to live. And so this idea of justice, what does justice mean? It doesn't just mean like, okay, do you get this sentence for your crime or the other sentence you get a disinterested judge or not. You're like, it doesn't just mean that justice means, you know, everything actually that when we say like social justice, now, that's what it means.And this change started to happen in the 19th century. So the first thing it did, this change happen? Did it happen with any degree of statistical significance? That was the first thing that we set out to do. And we developed a process that looked at word embeddings actually, and how word embeddings changed over time. And also as they were associated with individual newspapers to be able to say, okay, and then we did like a ton of error checking on this. So we ran a bunch of permutation tests.We came up with a whole bunch of synthetic data. And so in the end, the words that we said, like these definitely changed in our corpus with significance. We believe that now. And so first we found what these words were and some of them were some of these really ideologically charged words like justice, like freedom, not interestingly abolition, but I think rights was another word that sort of acquire these sort of more conceptual balances. But then beyond that, we wanted to find out who is doing the changing. If you subscribe to this belief, that words change by an annunciating them, whether it's by speaking or by using them in prints, they change because of how people use them.Then we wanted a way to figure who was doing, who was leading in these changes, who would introduce a change meaning. And then clearly if it was widely adopted by the general public or in our case, this particular corpus, like who was the next to pick it up. And so we actually built on a measure that said  he actually just got his PhD from Georgia Tech. He's moving on to Berkeley. He developed for another paper from a totally unrelated context about innovative language and citation counts. And he actually developed a method that showed that people who use innovative language in papers actually have higher citation counts.But what he was able to do is look at the overall embedding for any particular word. And then look at the embedding for that word that was associated with a particular newspaper and say, okay, if at a certain point, the specific embedding for that newspaper takes over as the one that predicts what the other newspapers, how the other newspapers will use that word. Then that's a sign that this newspaper is leading the change for this particular word.And he was able to set it up so that we looked at every single word, every single newspaper, every single time period in the corpus. And then we pulled out what we talk about in the paper as the leaders in a semantic changes and then the fast followers of these changes. And so I guess the one last thing that I'll say about that is it actually did show us some interesting things and it's related to the conversation we were having earlier. So Lydia Maria Child, again, the editor of this like fairly mainstream abolitionist newspaper, where she was brought on board to be more moderate, to temper the movement, to bring more people who might've been a little bit hesitant to join the cause because they perceived it to be too radical.Her tenure as editor of her newspaper is called the national anti-slavery standard. Ashley was characterized, she was the editor who was quick to adopt the most number of words. So this is an indicator that she had her eye on the discourse, but she never innovated. But as soon as she saw that there was this interesting new development, she would jump on it. And so that was a really interesting finding. And interestingly, the newspaper that innovated in the most number of words was the liberator, which was the more radical newspaper edited by William Lloyd Garrison that he and she together recognized as like too radical to appeal to most people.So they let him innovate and she was fast to follow. And so we found in this quantitative analysis confirmation of the major dynamic that has been remarked upon in the qualitative research. But then again, the other really interesting thing, we found Mary Ann Shad, who I was talking about before, this black woman editor who was known, or at least felt that she was being sort of unfairly maligned for her radical views. Lo and behold, not only did she innovate ideologically, but she also innovated at the level of language. So she had many more new word usages that then other newspapers of its ilk.And then the other really interesting finding and interesting in this way by kind of like complicated and potentially bad is that we added in some non -abolitionist newspapers in order to sort of get some outside context. So we added in some general audience newspapers and some women's suffrage newspapers because the women's suffrage movement, as I think most people know, but if not like it sort of ran alongside the abolitionists movement at some times when it was expedient, they sort of dovetail it in their aims. And then at other times, as we know now from the historical record, the white women intent on their own political franchise were quite actually racist and were very clearly willing to put their own political enfranchisement ahead of black people's actual freedom.Found in spite of the racism that really came to characterize a women's suffrage movement, they actually innovated in a lot of words in this abolitionists discourse. And I'm still sitting with that, trying to figure out what it, well, I think we know what it means, is that we know that there's a disconnect between what people say and what they do. And there's some interesting, like broad social theories of socio-linguistics and broad findings that have shown that like women tend to innovate linguistically more than men do.This has been proved longitudinally through oral interviews hand annotation of data and things like this. It also may have something to do with the range of what are called, like women's conversations versus the narrowness of what men feel compelled to speak. I mean, there's like weird broad strokes that you could paint. You could sort of get like a broad strokes explanation for this. But I actually find that pretty unsatisfying. To me, it really shows the, like I said before, this disconnect between people who know what the politically expedient or politically correct position is to voice.And then the people who write about it in the newspapers, but then the gap between that position as voiced and to how they actually follow through with their actions. This is the grand challenge of political change. It's that so many more people are willing to say, for example, black lives matter, but then like, what are you going to do about it? This is, I think what academia and the country has been grappling with over the past year. The first step is to recognize that we have tremendous racial inequality in our country and the world. But are you willing as a white person, as a white scholar, as a white academic, what are you going to give up so that we can rebalance this. That's harder to do.And so, anyway, so I feel like I actually would like to spend some more time digesting those results because I think they're pretty interesting.Michael Garfield (12m 52s): There's a lot there. Well, one thing that I, I just want to attend to, and maybe we don't need to linger on this, but it's, it's fascinating is working in social media I am just woefully disappointed with the measures by which we determine influence in society generally, somebody is an influencer because they have a million followers, but like you just said, I actually, a lot of the people are actually just popularizes, they're not really innovating anything.And so it seems like we need to draw on research like this in order to better understand the points of leverage. It's easier to notice that the second person on the dance floor is the one that gets everybody on the dance floor, but that kind of thing. It's like right now, the incentive structure is such that if you are one of these folks, that's listening carefully, that's casting a wide net. And then, like popularizing a hashtag, Luckily we're capable of tracing things now to identify who actually created the hashtag.But like that person historically is not rewarded. And even now it's banal, but like the people that are doing the innovation are not necessarily the people that are being approached by marketing agencies, because they're not the ones with the enormous audience. And so that touches back to comments that you'd made a moment ago about the incentive structure in academic research. How does somebody doing truly innovative research get funded for it. You need people that are capable of seeing things in the way that you're, you're talking about them, but actually, one of the things I'd like to explore a little bit more with you, something kind of curious that you touched on here in the results of this paper, about how justice goes from this concrete meaning to a much more abstract meaning, but in other places in the corpus, the word equality goes in the opposite direction.The word freedom goes in the opposite direction. And it makes me wonder if there's a pattern that we can observe here that is related to patterns in evolutionary dynamics about the pressure to move from like a generalist to a specialist or back, under what contexts is a messy, broad interoperable strategy better. And in which cases do you want something that's really like precise and attuned to a particular context.And, and I'm curious how you understand these two different trajectories in the work and what you think it means about the evolution of language under certain discursive constraints and so on.Lauren Klein (15m 45s): That's a really interesting observation. And to be honest, I hadn't really thought about that before. I mean, one can see how certain external pressures might make a word need to be used in a more precise way than it had been in the past. And I should say that one of the things that we were pretty attentive to, and I'd say, this is mostly the influence of Jacob, was really trying to not make claims that extended beyond the corpus. So we actually we never used the word influence in the paper because we didn't want anyone to impute any sort of causal relationship between anything that we were implying.We just wanted to say, within this corpus, this is what's going on, because there's too many exogenous influences, there's too many things that could be actually at the root of some of the changes that we're seeing. All we really wanted to say was like, when this corpus, which honestly has a lot of the big names in the newspaper space at this time, but not all of them. And that's what we wanted to do. I think that what I'll say about how language works and this isn't really an answer to your question, but it is another interesting finding that sort of prompted one of the things about this paper is there were a couple of steps in the research process and those corresponded to steps when in our own analysis we thought we will be done and we would have enough to say, but like there kind of wasn't enough there.Or we found a surprising result that we wanted to dig a little bit deeper into. And one of those results had to do with the fact that at some point in the process, we had the embeddings, we came up with the words, we had a ranking, there was a just because of the metric that Sandeep developed with respect to leading and following, we could rank them according to the strength like this word was one that very, very clearly it was one that changed to a high degree. And this one changed to a little bit less of a significant degree. So we ranked them when we looked at that we actually hand read through the top 2000 words that had exhibited these changes.And not very many of them were these sort of ideologically pregnant words, or like these keywords as you might call them in the Raymond Williams approach to culture, most of them were fairly common words, fought and struggled and hope and wish. And they were like adjectives and verbs. And yet they've remained in this list of highly significant word changes once passed through all the different error checking that we did.And so there has to be something here and what this pointed to the fact that the vast majority of these words were sort of words at the level of discourse rather than explicitly ideological keywords, was that what was changing in these newspapers was the way that people talked about political change. And in some ways, and this sort of gets at this idea of invisible labor that I was talking about in this other paper, you can't drill down beyond the level of discourse. You have to stop there.Like that's the base, that's the level that you can get at say that, I think what we're capturing is how this discussion took place, and we're just going to have to leave it there and trust that it did change. And that certain actors did lead in introducing changes about how well or how these certain concepts were discussed. And this is actually in the paper, what led us to try to take this aggregate view, where we decided, instead of trying to, again, like drill down into the meanings of these specific words, which I think resist any specific or indexical relation to some sort of abolitionists concept, just to say like, okay, like if this is at the level of discourse, then maybe we need to look at the level of discourse and do some aggregating.This was actually what led us to come up with some of the network structures that we end use and we present in the paper that led to these conclusions that I was talking about earlier, about how certain newspapers, like the Liberator, or like the Provincial Freeman where these real leaders in terms of language.Michael Garfield (19m 42s): So two more questions that I hope that we have time to discuss on this. And one of which is about the role of a randomization in this work. You mentioned that in the, in the first paper we discussed, the sampling process relies on random selection. Therefore the model yields a slightly different set of topics. Each time the code is run this aspect of topic modeling inference is important to acknowledge. And then in this paper, you explain that this is necessary for a number of reasons, and that to touch back on the comments that we'd made about honesty in journalism.And so on that this is a way of trying to help wash out bias both in the data and in the approach that you're taking to it. So I'd love to hear you give a little bit on that.Lauren Klein (20m 36s): Randomization enters the process in, or it in two very different places in those different papers. So how topic modeling works is you begin with a random allocation of words into topics, and then through an iterative process, those topics get refined. And so the idea is ultimately they converge on stable topics, but you always need to begin with a random allocation. That's just how LDA topic modeling, just how it works.So two things, one is that while the topics begin with a random allocation of words and is also true, and anyone who's worked with topic modeling knows this, they do ultimately because topic modeling as an algorithm make sense, they do ultimately always converge on similar topics. And so like if you run a topic model over a corpus, a lot of times it's like in this for instance, this abolitionist newspaper topic, corpus of like, I've run probably hundreds of topic models on this.Like you always do sort of end up with like a cooking one and abolition one and a war one, like they're all roughly the same. But what this also means is that it's a caution to primarily humanists who have a tendency to close read the meaning of individual words. You can't necessarily say, oh, because this specific word ends up as a most significant word in this specific topic. That word has unique significance within the topic. Really what I was just trying to say in that paper is we need to take the topic as the smallest unit that we can, that we can analyze.Maybe it's below that actually similar to this question of discourse, like below that the specific words that comprise the topic are slightly unstable underneath. In this paper what we used randomization to do was as a caution against spurious correlations. Like it could have just been that there was, like one newspaper published a lot in a very short frequency on a specific topic, not topic model, but like just like issue. And therefore there was an inflection, there was a change in the word, but really it was the result not of like general word uses usage, but just because there was this very specific issue that happened to involve the use of the specific word in the specific newspaper.So we wanted to guard against that. We also have the general problem of these newspapers themselves are being very sporadic or uneven in their publication history. So we had some newspapers that publish the entire length of the span of our corpus from the 1820s to 1865, where we kept it. We had others which popped in and out for a year or two. We had some which published weekly, some monthly, some which did huge issues of 20 pages, some which only had like a bi-fold or broadside kind of print. So I think we really wanted to make sure that we weren't capturing anything that wasn't actually related to the change in word usage of the specific words.And so what we essentially did, I'm trying to think of the specific places where this came into play. So one of the things that we did was we created a totally I'll be created synthetic data. So we ran it, we took the same words and actually, I want to make sure that I'm getting this right, but I think we took the same words and we assigned them to different newspapers, randomized newspapers at random time periods. And the idea was that if you ran the same model, you would not get the same measure of this word change because the newspapers have been read the, the source of it happened randomized.And instead you would see no correlation or you see no change because it was random data. And then we ran through this, I believe he did it like a hundred times. We said, okay, well, what words routined there the significant change when compare it to the synthetic data among all of these different permutations of the data that we ran. And so that was a way that we were trying to guard against false conclusions from the data. And I guess it all leads to the end, which is don't draw false conclusions from the data because you don't understand how the process works, but it was two very different deployments of randomization.One at the very beginning versus one at the end to try to guard against us.Michael Garfield (24m 44s): I'm kind of reminded of the conversation I had with Peter Dodds of the University of Vermont on the show, when he's talking about looking at Twitter and how the approaches that he took to Twitter gave a much deeper understanding of the way that different terms are taken up into parlance and the life cycle that they have in society compared to Google Ngrams, which is only looking at the frequencies of the words in a given subset of all books published, and grams is not doing the kind of work that you're doing in tracing the networks of adoption, which is something that you can do on Twitter.But then, that's actually not to the point of randomness. That's just to the point of why you must randomized so that you're not conflating suddenly this appears in all of these books or disappears with that meaning that it actually is the people may not be reading those books and they may not actually be talking about.Lauren Klein (25m 47s): But Benjamin has done some great work on this showing how the artifacts. So because Google Ngrams comes from major university libraries and he talks about how you can actually find some interesting textual artifacts that show up as spikes and like that standard Google Ngram chart, they actually just have to do with either major acquisitions decisions on the part of a single library or a cataloging decisions. I know he looks at, for instance, the zip code of Cambridge, Massachusetts, 0 2 1 3 8. And there's this tremendous spike that you can find when you do the Google and grants with graph and he's like, no, Ashley, this is just when Harvard digitized all of their books pre a certain dates and dumped them into Google Ngrams.And because it says property of, or acquired by Harvard University libraries or one or whatever, like that's where it shows up, but his work, he actually does amazing work in general with these like data artifacts or the artifacts in the data that actually show you a lot about the process of data creation, as opposed to what you actually thought your data was captured.Michael Garfield (26m 48s): So from there, I'd like to land this conversation with a question about this, particularly like looking forward and how a data feminist approach grants some insight or offers some strategy in terms of our own writing and our own content creation broadly, how the media that we produce now, we can kind of reframe the process of how we produce it and how we archive it and preserve it for future analysis, and how we might be able to build on or apply your research to coming up with a more equitable database for future historians and people that are looking to use a more accurate read of history to provide better results in terms of resource allocation, economic policy, et cetera. How do we leave a better record for the future so that they can make better decisions?Lauren Klein (27m 56s): It's such a good question. And I actually think it's a hopeful one to end on because I actually think there is some pretty clear solutions here. I think this is something that Catherine and I say and data feminism, but I think anyone who works with data knows, data is created by people. Data are created by people, if you want to be pedantic about it. And because they are created by people, they necessarily involve choices about what to count, what not to count, what to classify, what not to classify, what to include, what not to include.And then there's also a whole separate set of issues about the impact of the data. What is the capture of this data? Who does it impact? Who does it potentially harm? What is the analysis of this data? What is the impact? Who does it potentially harm? Like you need to be thinking about human impacts always. And I think when you start there, and again, this is with an eye to ultimately doing not just more valid research, but more ethical research and more enduring research. But when you think about that, there actually have been some really interesting sort of ally projects that have come out both from the CS space, also from the data journalism space.And also just from like the open data movement, more generally, which have to do with documenting the context surrounding a dataset so that it can be passed on if it should be passed on, in more thorough ways than I think simply just recording some basic metadata about a data set and then depositing it since some sort of OER open institutional repository type situation. So I'm thinking here, there's this great paper, Tim Gebru was the lead author, but it's a multi-author paper called Data Sheets for Data Sets.And all this is just a series of very thought out questions about data provenance, data collection, potential impacts, test potential ethical issues. Just making sure that even if you yourself might have thought to ask this question about a dataset, you should be asking these questions before you proceed at any phase of any data related project, whether it's collection analysis, communication, compiling, and future sharing of the data set. And so on. Heather Krauss has this great, a little bit more simplified approach called the data biography, which just involves asking like who, what, when, where, why, how about your dataset and the way that journalists know how to sort of ground truth, other sorts of bits of evidence that they have. Bob Gradeck is someone involved in civic data.And he has this idea of the data user guide, but all of these approaches are roughly doing the same thing, which is to try to give more context around the data, try to build more awareness of on the one hand, try to make it more useful in the future, but also to be aware of the potential harms of these data, if they get in the wrong hands, or if they're used or abused by some sort of corporation or other institution that doesn't have the interest of the people or the issue that the data is documented, that doesn't have those best interest in mind.Michael Garfield (30m 57s): Well, before we just close out on this, I would just like to due to the nature of this conversation, if there are any contributors agents to this work, my questions we have failed to ask any people we have failed to credit, or maybe not even human people, but just, you know, agencies and influences. Who should we not leave invisible before we sign out?Lauren Klein (31m 28s): That's a really a great question. I appreciate your asking it. I think that I've named all of the coerced authors on all of the papers that we've talked about, but I will say that a lot of this work, most of this work has come up through the Digital Humanities Lab that I run now at Emory, but for a lot of years at Georgia Tech and that involved a lot of undergraduate students passing through for semesters and years and durations of their undergraduate careers, experimenting with this data, helping me think through issues and just sort of generally working towards these kinds of publications that you see and it's tough, again, this is sort of invisible labor because it's not directly visible.In these final papers that were published and yet the work could not have happened without them. And actually I'll just say, watch the skies I'm working on this project. Hopefully it will be really soon on the history of data visualization. And one of the figures that I talk about in this project is W.E.B. Du Bois. And he, I think somewhat famously at this point involved a lot of his students in the production of his data visualizations. And so one of the things that I'm trying to do is think of a visual way that we can sort of testify to these students' even if they aren't named in the output itself.So yeah, maybe I'll maybe I'll end there and just say, yeah, thanks for this great conversation. I really appreciate it. And I appreciate the space to talk about labor at the variant. Michael Garfield (32m 52s): This has been a treat. Thank you so much for taking the time.

71,  Episode Notes What makes a satisfying explanation? Understanding and prediction are two different goals at odds with one another — think fundamental physics versus artificial neural networks — and even what defines a “simple” explanation varies from one person to another. Held in a kind of ecosystemic balance, these diverse approaches to seeking knowledge keep each other honest…but the use of one kind of knowledge to the exclusion of all others leads to disastrous results. And in the 21st Century, the difference between good and bad explanations determines how society adapts as rapid change transforms the world most people took for granted — and sends humankind into the epistemic wilds  to find new stories that will help us navigate this brave new world.This week we dive deep with SFI External Professor Simon DeDeo at Carnegie Mellon University to explore his research into intelligence and the search for understanding, bringing computational techniques to bear on the history of science, information processing at the scale of society, and how digital technologies and the coronavirus pandemic challenge humankind to think more carefully about the meaning that we seek, here on the edge of chaos…If you value our research and communication efforts, please subscribe to Complexity Podcast wherever you  listen, rate and review us at Apple Podcasts, and/or consider making a donation at santafe.edu/engage.
